      "factual_background":"The case arises from a January 5, 2021 police confrontation that culminated in the fatal shooting of Michael Conlon inside his Newton, Massachusetts apartment building. Around 1:45 p.m., Newton Police Department (NPD) Officer Zachary Raymond responded to a report of an ongoing armed robbery at Indulge!, a candy store at 16 Lincoln Street in Newton. Upon arrival, Raymond saw Michael Conlon standing outside the store holding a small kitchen knife. Raymond drew his sidearm and ordered Conlon to drop the knife. Conlon, a twenty-eight-year-old man suffering from mental illness that caused him to fear the police, fled into his adjacent three\u2011story apartment building instead of complying.\n\nConlon ran up to the third (top) floor with Officer Raymond pursuing. On reaching the third floor, Conlon turned toward Raymond, held the kitchen knife to his own neck, and threatened to cut his own throat if Raymond advanced. Raymond then retreated to the second\u2011floor landing to await backup. Conlon used the butt of the knife to knock on the door of Apartment 3 at the top of the stairs, repeatedly asking to speak with a neighbor who was not home.\n\nSeveral NPD officers and Massachusetts State Police (MSP) troopers arrived, including Captains Dennis Dowling and Christopher Marzilli. They observed Conlon standing in front of the entryway to Apartment 3 on the third\u2011floor landing. Conlon was spitting and drooling, saying he believed he was in a simulation and questioning whether the officers were \"real.\" Dowling and Marzilli recognized that Conlon was in a mental\u2011health crisis, and an NPD social worker was called to the scene. An NPD officer arrived with NPD social worker Sarah Eknanian, who stayed in a police car outside, and an NPD lieutenant contacted the Northeastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council (the \"Council\") to request a negotiator and a tactical team trained in de\u2011escalation and negotiation with mentally ill or suicidal persons. The Council typically requires about thirty minutes to respond in Newton.\n\nAdditional officers continued to arrive. Officer Francis Scaltreto assumed the primary role of negotiating with Conlon, positioning himself about twelve feet away from Conlon in the narrow third\u2011floor hallway. Either Dowling or Marzilli instructed Sergeant Glenn Chisholm to retrieve his \"beanbag shotgun,\" described as a usually less\u2011than\u2011lethal weapon, and stand in the doorway of Apartment 4 alongside Officer Richard Benes. Apartment 4\u2019s entryway was approximately twenty feet down the hall from where Conlon stood outside Apartment 3. Two MSP troopers flanked Chisholm and Benes near the doorway to Apartment 4, and four additional NPD officers waited inside Apartment 4. An NPD lieutenant with a shield waited at the bottom of the stairwell below Conlon. Officers also gained access to the building\u2019s back entrance, used Apartment 4 as a staging area, and barricaded the rear door to Apartment 3 so that Conlon could not exit through that unit.\n\nCaptain Marzilli informed arriving officers that Conlon was a \"psych patient\" and that the situation was a \"mental health issue.\" Captains Dowling and Marzilli agreed they should attempt to wait for the Council\u2019s team before apprehending Conlon, while also agreeing that if the situation deteriorated, Sergeant Chisholm would incapacitate Conlon using the beanbag shotgun. If that occurred, two MSP troopers were to back up Chisholm with tasers, and, if those non\u2011lethal measures failed, Officer Benes was to be prepared to use his sidearm as lethal force. This plan was communicated to officers on scene. Marzilli, Chisholm, and Benes supported the plan. The MSP troopers expressed doubts that their tasers would be effective because Conlon was wearing thick winter clothing.\n\nDuring negotiations, Conlon, still agitated, held the kitchen knife in one hand and a fire extinguisher in the other. He insisted he was in a simulation and repeatedly asked to speak with his father. Several officers adopted his delusional framework, telling him they would call his father if he dropped the knife. After approximately twenty minutes of negotiation, Officer Scaltreto persuaded Conlon to drop both the knife and the fire extinguisher by telling him that the rules of the \"simulation\" required him to release the knife before the police could contact his father. Officers also promised Conlon that he would not be harmed. Conlon complied and dropped the items to the floor.\n\nOnce Conlon dropped the knife, Officer Scaltreto communicated to the officers behind him that there was an \"opening.\" Captain Marzilli relayed this to Captain Dowling, who then radioed Sergeant Chisholm to use the beanbag shotgun on Conlon; Marzilli confirmed the order to Chisholm. Chisholm, standing about twelve feet from Conlon, pointed the beanbag shotgun at Conlon\u2019s collarbone and pulled the trigger. The weapon misfired, making a loud clicking noise but not discharging. Chisholm then attempted to clear the malfunction by discharging a round but was unable to do so.\n\nAccording to some, but not all, officers\u2019 accounts, Conlon reacted to the misfire by picking up the knife and moving toward Sergeant Chisholm. An MSP trooper then deployed his taser at Conlon. Nearly simultaneously, Officers Benes and Scaltreto fired their sidearms, fatally shooting Conlon. Plaintiffs allege that the officers gave \"inconsistent statements\" after the incident about officers\u2019 positions, what Conlon was doing in the hallway, and whether he picked up the knife after the beanbag shotgun was fired. Plaintiffs further allege that officers have not corroborated the claim that Conlon rearmed himself with photographic evidence and that there was conflicting testimony regarding whether the knife was near Conlon when he was killed. The Council\u2019s tactical and negotiation team arrived about six minutes after the shooting. An autopsy revealed that Conlon suffered fatal gunshot wounds to the head, neck, and torso.",

        "claims_brought":"Plaintiffs, as personal representatives of Michael Conlon\u2019s estate, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the City of Newton and several NPD officers involved in the incident: Officers Francis Scaltreto and Richard Benes, Sergeant Glenn Chisholm, and Captains Dennis Dowling and Christopher Marzilli. As relevant to the appeal, Plaintiffs asserted: (1) claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the individual officers for use of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment (Count 1); (2) claims under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA) against the officers, based on alleged excessive force (Count 8); (3) a wrongful death claim under the Massachusetts Wrongful Death Act (Count 9); (4) a common law assault claim against Sergeant Chisholm (Count 10); (5) a \u00a7 1983 Monell claim against the City alleging failure to train and supervise officers regarding mental\u2011health emergencies and the use of beanbag shotguns (Count 2); and (6) claims against the City under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act alleging failure to accommodate Conlon\u2019s disability and failure to adequately train officers (Counts 4\u20136).",
        "district_court_decision":"The City of Newton and the officer defendants moved to dismiss all claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing failure to state a claim and asserting qualified immunity on behalf of the officers. The district court granted the motion in full, dismissing all federal and state claims against the officers and the City. In dismissing the \u00a7 1983 excessive force claim based on the fatal shooting, the court noted that the complaint left open \"myriad factual questions\" about the critical moments before the shooting but read the complaint as accepting that Conlon was armed with a knife and advancing on Sergeant Chisholm when he was shot, and concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on that basis. The district court also dismissed the beanbag shotgun\u2013related excessive force theory, the MCRA claim, the Monell claim against the City, and the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.",
        "what_is_appealed":"On appeal, Plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of: (1) their \u00a7 1983 Fourth Amendment excessive force claim against Officers Scaltreto, Benes, Chisholm, Dowling, and Marzilli, both as to the attempted deployment of the beanbag shotgun and the subsequent fatal shooting; (2) their \u00a7 1983 Monell failure\u2011to\u2011train and supervise claim against the City of Newton; (3) their ADA claims (including failure-to-train and failure-to-accommodate theories); (4) their Rehabilitation Act claims; and (5) their MCRA claim against the officer defendants. Plaintiffs do not develop any meaningful appellate argument challenging the dismissal of their Massachusetts wrongful death (Count 9) and common law assault (Count 10) claims, and they do not respond in their reply brief to the officers\u2019 arguments regarding those claims; the appellate court treats any challenge to the dismissal of Counts 9 and 10 as waived and limits its review to the remaining claims."

Reasonableness is assessed from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, accounting for tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving circumstances, and balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion against the governmental interests at stake (Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386). When qualified immunity is asserted, the plaintiff must plausibly allege (1) a violation of a federal statutory or constitutional right and (2) that the unlawfulness of the officer\u2019s conduct was clearly established at the time, meaning existing controlling authority or a robust consensus of persuasive authority would have put a reasonable officer on notice that the conduct was unconstitutional, and that an objectively reasonable officer would have understood that his conduct violated clearly established law."

Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H\u201311I). Courts interpret this to require proof of threats, intimidation, or coercion in addition to the underlying rights violation; a direct violation of rights, without more, does not itself satisfy the statute\u2019s threats\/intimidation\/coercion requirement (Longval v. Comm\u2019r of Corrs., 404 Mass. 325; Sarvis v. Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Co., 711 N.E.2d 911).

          "legal_standard":"Under Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, a municipality is liable under \u00a7 1983 only when an official policy or custom causes a constitutional violation; it is not vicariously liable for employees\u2019 acts. To establish failure-to-train municipal liability, a plaintiff must show: (1) a municipal policy or custom of inadequate training; (2) that this deficiency actually caused the constitutional injury; and (3) that municipal policymakers were deliberately indifferent to the rights of persons with whom officers come into contact (City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378). Deliberate indifference is a stringent standard, typically requiring a showing of a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees, or, in a narrow range of cases, that the need for specific training was so obvious that the constitutional violation was a highly predictable consequence of the failure to equip officers to handle recurring situations (Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51; Young v. City of Providence, 404 F.3d 4)."

          "legal_standard":"Title II of the ADA provides that no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132). To state a Title II claim, a plaintiff generally must allege: (1) that the decedent was a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he was excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of a public entity\u2019s services, programs, or activities, or otherwise discriminated against; and (3) that such exclusion, denial, or discrimination was by reason of his disability. A failure\u2011to\u2011accommodate claim requires that the public entity knew or reasonably should have known of the disability and failed to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination, unless such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service or activity. In this circuit, it remains an open question whether Title II imposes a duty to adopt specific policies and training for police in dealing with mentally ill individuals, but where a department has policies and training, mere allegations that they were inadequate do not suffice to state a claim (Buchanan v. Maine, 469 F.3d 158). The Rehabilitation Act applies substantially the same standards as Title II to entities receiving federal financial assistance; the same legal framework generally governs both statutes."

          "Plaintiffs argue that the First Amended Complaint plausibly alleges that the officer defendants used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment both when Sergeant Chisholm attempted to fire the beanbag shotgun and when Officers Benes and Scaltreto used lethal force. They emphasize that Conlon was in a mental\u2011health crisis, had not threatened to harm anyone but himself, and had complied with officers\u2019 requests to drop the knife and fire extinguisher based on assurances that he would not be harmed and that his father would be contacted. According to Plaintiffs, firing a beanbag shotgun at close range at an unarmed, compliant, mentally ill individual unreasonably escalated the encounter, and the subsequent lethal shooting was likewise unreasonable, especially given alleged inconsistencies in officers\u2019 accounts of whether Conlon had rearmed himself with the knife and how he moved in the moments before being shot.",
          "Regarding qualified immunity, Plaintiffs contend that clearly established law prohibits officers from increasing the level of force once a suspect has ceased resisting or posing an immediate threat, and they invoke First Circuit precedents such as Jennings v. Jones and Raiche v. Pietroski, as well as decisions from other circuits addressing beanbag and less\u2011lethal weapons, to argue that an objectively reasonable officer would have known that deploying the beanbag shotgun in these circumstances was unlawful. They also argue that whether Conlon was armed and advancing with a knife at the time of the fatal shooting is a disputed factual issue that cannot be resolved at the motion\u2011to\u2011dismiss stage.",
          "On the MCRA claim, Plaintiffs argue that the use or attempted use of the beanbag shotgun, in the context of the threats inherent in pointing and firing such a weapon at Conlon, constituted threats or coercion sufficient to satisfy the statute\u2019s requirement of interference with rights by threats, intimidation, or coercion. They assert that the shooting and the surrounding conduct interfered with Conlon\u2019s constitutional rights in a coercive manner.",
          "With respect to the \u00a7 1983 Monell claim, Plaintiffs assert that the City of Newton failed to adequately train and supervise its officers on the use of deadly force, including beanbag shotguns, and on how to respond to individuals with mental illness. They contend that the need for such training was so obvious that the City\u2019s failure to provide it amounted to deliberate indifference, even in the absence of a documented pattern of similar prior incidents. They argue that the complaint\u2019s allegations, including that the officers had never before fired a beanbag shotgun in an active situation and that NPD training on responding to mental illness was minimal, plausibly support a single\u2011incident theory of municipal liability.",
          "On their ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, Plaintiffs argue that the City\u2019s failure to train officers in dealing with mentally ill individuals and its failure during this incident to adjust tactics in light of Conlon\u2019s mental illness constitute failures to reasonably accommodate his disability, thereby denying him the benefits of nondiscriminatory police services. They maintain that the officers and the City knew or should have known of Conlon\u2019s mental disability, yet failed to use available mental\u2011health resources (such as the social worker on scene and the Council\u2019s specialized team) and instead escalated force.

They assert that Conlon remained a threat even after initially dropping the knife because it lay at his feet and could be readily picked up, as some officers reported he did after the beanbag misfire, and that the officers were seeking to de\u2011escalate the situation by attempting non\u2011lethal incapacitation before resorting to deadly force.",
          "On qualified immunity, the officer defendants argue that, even if a constitutional violation could be inferred, they are entitled to immunity because there was no clearly established law at the time of the incident indicating that attempting to deploy a beanbag shotgun, a usually less\u2011than\u2011lethal weapon, at Conlon under these circumstances violated the Fourth Amendment. They contend that existing case law did not provide fair notice that their conduct was unlawful and that a reasonable officer, aware of NPD\u2019s General Order 301 regarding beanbag use and the risks posed by a knife\u2011armed individual in close quarters, could have believed the force used (or attempted) was lawful. They also maintain that, under clearly established law, officers are permitted to use deadly force when confronting a suspect advancing with a knife who poses an immediate threat to officers or others.",
          "Regarding the MCRA claim, defendants argue that Plaintiffs allege only the direct use of force in effecting a seizure, without any separate threats, intimidation, or coercion aimed at compelling Conlon to forgo some additional right. They contend that Massachusetts law requires more than the underlying use of force itself to state an MCRA claim and that the complaint does not allege that the force was used to coerce Conlon into giving up a particular statutory or constitutional right such as speech, association, or the right to resist arrest (which, they note, is not protected).",
          "On the Monell claim, the City argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege deliberate indifference because the complaint identifies only a single incident\u2014the Conlon shooting\u2014and does not plead any pattern of similar constitutional violations or any specific facts about existing training that would show an obvious and patently inadequate program. The City notes that NPD had policies regarding beanbag shotguns and that officers called in specialized mental\u2011health resources (the Council and the department social worker), which, in the City\u2019s view, contradicts the assertion that it failed to train or was deliberately indifferent. The City maintains that allegations of minimal or imperfect training are insufficient under the stringent deliberate indifference standard.",
          "With respect to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, the City argues that Title II does not impose vicarious liability on municipalities for officers\u2019 on\u2011the\u2011scene use of force and that, in any event, Plaintiffs merely allege that existing policies and training were ineffective or inadequate, which is not actionable under Buchanan v. Maine. The City also contends that Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that Conlon was denied access to any specific service, program, or activity of the City, or that any actions taken by officers were \"by reason of\" his disability as opposed to his conduct (e.g., possessing a knife, noncompliance). The City asserts that Plaintiffs fail to identify a specific, feasible reasonable accommodation that officers should have implemented in the rapidly evolving circumstances, and that the same analysis forecloses the Rehabilitation Act claim, which follows the same standards as Title II."

The complaint does not clearly concede that Conlon was armed and advancing with a knife at the instant he was shot; indeed, it highlights inconsistencies and the absence of corroboration on that point. The district court effectively resolved those factual disputes against plaintiffs when it treated Conlon as armed and advancing. Taking the complaint as pled, there is a plausible Fourth Amendment claim that (1) attempting to shoot an unarmed, compliant, mentally ill person with a beanbag shotgun at close range\u2014after he dropped the knife in reliance on promises that he would not be harmed\u2014was an unreasonable escalation of force, and (2) the subsequent use of lethal force was likewise unreasonable if a jury could find that he had not rearmed himself or posed an immediate threat. On qualified immunity, First Circuit precedent (e.g., Jennings, Raiche) and broader case law clearly establish that officers may not increase the level of force once a suspect has ceased resisting and no longer poses an immediate threat. The absence of a beanbag\u2011specific case does not defeat clearly established law where the core principle\u2014escalating force against an unarmed, surrendered individual\u2014is well settled. Because the complaint plausibly alleges a violation of clearly established law and the district court relied on inferences contrary to the pleadings, dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 excessive\u2011force claim on qualified\u2011immunity grounds was improper."

Plaintiffs\u2019 theory rests entirely on the force used in effecting the seizure\u2014pointing and attempting to fire the beanbag shotgun and then using lethal force. Under Massachusetts precedent (Longval and progeny), a direct use of force to effect an arrest or seizure, without something more aimed at coercing the victim to forgo an additional right, does not satisfy the statute. Plaintiffs do not plausibly allege that force was used to make Conlon relinquish some separate right (e.g., speech, association); rather, the alleged coercion is the excessive force itself.

The complaint identifies only this single episode and offers generalized assertions that NPD training on beanbag shotguns and mental\u2011health encounters was minimal, while also acknowledging that NPD had a beanbag policy and that officers summoned a social worker and a specialized outside negotiation\/tactical team. Those facts cut against an inference of total failure to train or deliberate indifference.

But the pleadings also show that the police recognized his mental illness, called a social worker, and requested a specialized team. The complaint does not plausibly allege that Conlon was excluded from any particular service or treated worse than non\u2011disabled persons would have been in materially similar, armed, barricaded\u2011suspect circumstances; the asserted discrimination flows from how officers responded to his conduct (flight, possession of a knife, erratic behavior), not from his disability per se.

By contrast, the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act claim is squarely foreclosed by state precedent requiring threats or coercion beyond the force itself. The Monell failure\u2011to\u2011train allegations are thin and identify only this incident, while acknowledging existing policies and mental\u2011health resources, which undermines deliberate\u2011indifference and obvious\u2011need theories. For the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, First Circuit law (especially Buchanan) is skeptical of using those statutes as generalized failure\u2011to\u2011train vehicles in policing contexts; the complaint does not plead discrimination \u201cby reason of\u201d disability or a specific, reasonable accommodation, especially given that officers actually sought mental\u2011health resources. Taken together, the likely result is a mixed disposition: reversal as to the individual officers on the \u00a7 1983 excessive\u2011force claim, and affirmance as to the MCRA, Monell, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act claims."

It authorizes the PRDA to detain lots of poultry meat that do not meet its requirements, impose fines on importers for violations, and, for repeated violations, revoke an importer\u2019s license.\n\nArticle XII(B) of Regulation No. 8 provides that an official of the PRDA must be present at the time of opening and unloading the container used to bring poultry products into Puerto Rico. For about five years after Regulation No. 8 was promulgated, the PRDA did not enforce or seek to enforce Article XII(B) against NWS.\n\nIn June 2021, the PRDA issued several detention orders against NWS, impounding over 200,000 pounds of fresh poultry products that NWS had transported from the continental United States. Violation notices explained that the orders were issued because a PRDA inspector was not physically present when the shipping containers were opened and unloaded at NWS's facilities, in alleged violation of Article XII(B). Over the following months, PRDA issued violation notices to NWS regarding thirty-five shipping containers that had been opened and unloaded outside the presence of a PRDA inspector, and asserted the right to impose approximately $263,000 in fines for these alleged violations.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"After unsuccessfully attempting to challenge the PRDA's violation notices through the administrative procedures outlined in Regulation No. 8, NWS filed a verified complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. NWS alleged, among other things, that Article XII(B) (the inspector-at-unloading requirement) and Article XIV(A)(6) (a labeling provision) of Market Regulation No. 8 are expressly preempted by the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 451\u2013473, and its implementing regulations. NWS sought declaratory and injunctive relief barring enforcement of those provisions against it.",
        "district_court_decision":"After PRDA filed its answer, NWS moved for injunctive relief and later filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of Article XIV(A)(6) (the labeling provision) against it; the district court granted that emergency motion. NWS then filed another emergency motion seeking to extend injunctive relief to Article XII(B), asserting that continued enforcement of the inspector-at-unloading requirement disrupted NWS's orderly and timely operations. The district court granted this motion, concluding that Article XII(B)'s inspector requirement fell within the PPIA's express preemption clause and was not preserved by the PPIA's savings clause. The court granted declaratory relief and permanently enjoined enforcement of Article XII(B) against NWS. It also granted declaratory and permanent injunctive relief on NWS's challenge to Article XIV(A)(6).",
        "what_is_appealed":"The PRDA, through its Secretary and Deputy Secretary, appealed the district court's ruling as to Article XII(B). The appeal challenges the district court's determination that Article XII(B)'s requirement of a PRDA inspector's presence when containers are opened and unloaded at NWS's facility is expressly preempted by the PPIA and not saved by the PPIA's savings clause. The PRDA did not appeal the district court's ruling regarding Article XIV(A)(6)."

      "key_arguments":{
        "appellant_arguments":[
          "The PRDA contends that Article XII(B) is not preempted because the PPIA's term 'operations' in the phrase 'premises, facilities and operations of any official establishment' should be read in light of the statute's context as limited to slaughtering and processing activities, not to all aspects of a business such as distribution and unloading of containers. The PRDA points to the PPIA's definition of 'official establishment' as one at which inspection of the slaughter of poultry or the processing of poultry products is maintained, and to statutory and regulatory provisions referencing slaughtering and processing, to argue that matters not implicating slaughter or processing fall outside the PPIA's regulatory scope and thus outside the preemption clause.",
          "The PRDA further argues that even if 'operations' is given its ordinary, broader meaning, Article XII(B) has no direct effect on NWS's operations within the meaning of the PPIA's preemption clause. It asserts that the provision does not regulate how NWS processes, receives, handles, packages, or markets meat inside its facility, and that any impact from requiring an inspector to be present when containers are opened is merely incidental, unlike the direct regulation of slaughterhouse activities that was at issue in National Meat Association v. Harris under a parallel meat inspection statute.",
          "The PRDA also contends that the phrase 'premises, facilities and operations' should be read together to limit preemption to requirements concerning onsite operations of official establishments, i.e., those occurring on the establishments' premises or facilities. Relying on the Seventh Circuit's decision in Chicago-Midwest Meat Association v. City of Evanston, it argues that preemption does not extend to regulations affecting activities it characterizes as occurring outside the official establishment. By analogy to the municipal ordinance in that case permitting inspection of delivery vehicles away from regulated establishments, the PRDA suggests that Article XII(B) should be viewed as regulating an external aspect of delivery rather than onsite operations.",
          "Regarding the savings clause, the PRDA argues that the district court erred in concluding that Article XII(B) cannot be justified as an exercise of concurrent jurisdiction over poultry products that are 'outside' the official establishment. It maintains that the containers and their contents, when subject to inspection and the inspector-presence requirement, should be regarded as outside NWS's official establishment for purposes of the PPIA savings clause, drawing again on Chicago-Midwest Meat Association as support for its position that similar vehicle- or container-based inspection provisions may survive federal preemption.",
          "The PRDA disputes the district court's understanding of the interaction between the preemption clause and the savings clause, maintaining that the savings clause permits the Commonwealth to regulate in the manner Article XII(B) requires in order to prevent the distribution of adulterated or misbranded poultry products, and that this authority is not constrained solely to locations physically removed from an official establishment."
        ],
        "appellee_arguments":[
          "NWS argues that Article XII(B) is squarely within the PPIA's express preemption clause because it imposes a requirement concerning the 'operations' of an 'official establishment' that is 'in addition to, or different than' the requirements established by the PPIA and its regulations. NWS emphasizes that its facility has been designated as an 'official establishment' under the PPIA, and that the PPIA and its implementing regulations do not require the presence of a PRDA (or any state) inspector when shipping containers are opened and unloaded.",
          "NWS contends that 'operations' should be given its ordinary, broad meaning, encompassing the full range of activities involved in running its business, including receiving, unloading, handling, and distributing poultry products. It asserts that Article XII(B) directly regulates its operations by dictating when and how it may open and unload containers, affecting its distribution processes, causing delays, and decreasing the shelf life of imports, particularly in light of PRDA\u2019s acknowledged lack of sufficient inspectors and practice of conducting aleatory inspections.",
          "NWS argues that the PPIA's text and structure demonstrate that the statute regulates more than slaughter and processing, encompassing distribution, labeling, sanitation, recordkeeping, and other aspects of poultry products in commerce. It cites provisions concerning labeling, sanitation, and prohibitions on distribution of adulterated or misbranded products to show the breadth of the PPIA's regulatory scheme and to refute PRDA\u2019s claim that 'operations' is limited to slaughtering and processing.",
          "Regarding the geographic scope of 'premises, facilities and operations,' NWS relies on the parties' joint stipulation and PRDA's own violation notices establishing that the relevant shipping containers are 'opened and unloaded at the NWS facilities.' On this basis, NWS maintains that Article XII(B) regulates onsite operations within the official establishment and thus falls within the PPIA preemption clause, distinguishing this case from the delivery-vehicle inspections in Chicago-Midwest Meat Association, which involved inspections away from the premises.",
          "On the savings clause, NWS contends that it permits states and territories only to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over articles that have left an official establishment, to prevent distribution of adulterated or misbranded products outside that establishment. It argues that Article XII(B), as applied to NWS, does not regulate articles 'outside' the establishment because the containers are at NWS's own facility when opened and unloaded. NWS also maintains that the savings clause does not authorize states or territories to impose requirements that are additional to or different from federal requirements inside official establishments, but only to impose equivalent and fully consistent requirements or to enforce conduct that independently violates federal standards."

The text of \u00a7 467e preempts state requirements \u201cwith respect to premises, facilities and operations of any official establishment\u201d that are \u201cin addition to, or different than\u201d federal requirements. NWS\u2019s facility is undisputedly an \u201cofficial establishment.\u201d The jointly stipulated facts and PRDA\u2019s own notices establish that the containers are \u201copened and unloaded at the NWS facilities,\u201d so Article XII(B) regulates onsite activity, not off-premises conduct. The ordinary meaning of \u201coperations\u201d comfortably includes the receiving and unloading of containers as part of the establishment\u2019s business; the PPIA and its regulations address not only slaughter and processing but also handling and distribution of inspected products, which undercuts PRDA\u2019s narrow reading. There is no federal requirement that a Commonwealth inspector be physically present during unloading; thus Article XII(B) imposes an additional, different condition on the establishment\u2019s operations. Chicago\u2011Midwest is distinguishable because that ordinance authorized inspections away from the establishment premises, whereas here the requirement attaches to operations at the official establishment itself. Under the plain text, Article XII(B), as applied to NWS, falls within the preempted field. The district court\u2019s holding of express preemption is therefore likely affirmed."

          "reasoning":"Construction of the PPIA\u2019s savings clause is also a legal question reviewed de novo. The savings clause allows states and territories to exercise concurrent jurisdiction over inspected articles \u201cfor the purpose of preventing the distribution for human food purposes of any such articles which are adulterated or misbranded\u201d when those articles are \u201coutside\u201d an official establishment. By its terms, it preserves only post\u2011establishment regulation of products that have left an official establishment; it does not authorize additional or different requirements governing the operations of an official establishment itself. Here, the regulated activity is the opening and unloading of containers at NWS\u2019s facility\u2014conduct occurring within the official establishment\u2019s premises and operations. PRDA\u2019s attempt to characterize the containers as \u201coutside\u201d the establishment for savings\u2011clause purposes conflicts with the stipulated facts and stretches the clause beyond its text. Moreover, even where the savings clause permits concurrent jurisdiction, it does not license state rules that are \u201cin addition to, or different than\u201d federal requirements within the preempted subject matter; it allows equivalent, consistent enforcement against adulterated or misbranded products after they leave the establishment. Article XII(B) is a process requirement imposed at the establishment, not a parallel rule about adulteration or misbranding of goods outside it. Accordingly, the savings clause does not rescue Article XII(B), and the district court\u2019s conclusion that it is not preserved is properly affirmed."

      "reasoning":"Both issues turn on the interpretation of the same preemption framework in \u00a7 467e, which the district court approached by giving the relevant terms their ordinary meanings and by tracking Supreme Court guidance in analogous meat\u2011inspection cases. The undisputed facts place the containers and the unloading activity squarely at NWS\u2019s official establishment, making the comparison to off\u2011premises vehicle inspections in Chicago\u2011Midwest inapposite. The statutory phrase \u201cpremises, facilities and operations of any official establishment\u201d is broad enough to encompass receiving and unloading, and there is no parallel federal requirement mandating state inspector presence; Article XII(B) therefore adds a distinct operational condition and is preempted. The savings clause, by its own text, is limited to concurrent jurisdiction over inspected articles after they have left an official establishment and does not reopen the field Congress expressly occupied within official establishments. PRDA\u2019s broader reading of the savings clause would largely undercut the preemption clause and is unlikely to be adopted. Given this textual and structural analysis, the appellate court is likely to affirm the district court\u2019s declaratory and injunctive relief as to Article XII(B)."

      "factual_background":"Dahua Technology USA, Inc. (Dahua) is the U.S. subsidiary of Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang), a publicly traded Chinese surveillance technology company based in Hangzhou, China. Dahua maintains corporate offices in Waltham, Massachusetts. In January 2016, Feng \"Frank\" Zhang assumed an executive role at Dahua as Chief Strategy Officer, Vice President, and President of North American and Enterprise Sales.\n\nZhang\u2019s original employment terms were set out in a one-page agreement dated November 5, 2015 (the \"2015 Employment Agreement\"). Under that agreement, Zhang was to receive a one-time grant of Dahua common stock and a base salary of $510,000 annually for a three-year term. The agreement stated that his annual base salary was \"conditionally guaranteed,\" meaning it remained payable in full even if the company terminated Zhang for cause, subject to a carveout for termination for \"illegal conduct or company misconduct,\" in which event he would be compensated only for the duration of his employment without additional compensation.\n\nBy mid-2017, Zhejiang\u2019s Board of Directors decided to remove Zhang from day-to-day management of its North American business. Zhejiang\u2019s leadership, headed by founder and chairman Liquan Fu, consulted outside and in-house counsel on how to minimize risk from Zhang\u2019s early removal. Counsel identified two principal concerns: (1) potential exposure from terminating the 2015 Employment Agreement before the end of the three-year term, including remaining base salary, lost benefits, and the value of the guaranteed term; and (2) the lack of restrictive covenants in the 2015 Employment Agreement to prevent a disgruntled Zhang from publicizing security vulnerabilities the company had concealed, particularly given his role in negotiations for an important strategic acquisition.\n\nZhejiang\u2019s lawyers advised that mitigation required providing Zhang with a baseline severance package that would compensate him for salary, bonus, and other benefits due through the end of his three-year term, plus additional compensation to entice him to release all claims against Dahua and agree to restrictive covenants.\n\nIn late August 2017, Fu traveled to Massachusetts to negotiate Zhang\u2019s removal terms. On the drive from the airport, Fu told Zhang he was considering having \"young guys\" run the business. The next day at Fu\u2019s hotel, Fu told Zhang he wanted Zhang to move to a different role and offered Zhang a \"senior management\" position at Zhejiang\u2019s headquarters in China. Zhang declined, citing his children\u2019s education. Fu then offered Zhang a senior company advisor role in the United States. Zhang expressed interest but asked how the company would handle the remaining terms of the 2015 Employment Agreement. Fu said the company would \"follow whatever the [2015 Employment Agreement] says.\" Zhang replied, \"If [you] can take care of the agreement, I'm ok.\" Zhang asked what he would be asked to sign, and Fu said the company would make sure Zhang was \"comfortable\" and would \"treat [him] well.\"\n\nFu left to make a phone call. On returning, he told Zhang they were \"all set.\" Zhejiang in-house counsel Haiyan Yue then emailed Dahua\u2019s outside counsel stating: \"It\u2019s been decided: [Zhang] will serve as a consultant. Dahua will pay him the remaining 16[-] month salary plus a monthly consulting fee. The consulting period is 2 years.\"\n\nLater that day at Dahua\u2019s Waltham office, Attorney Yue presented Fu and Zhang with drafts of a separation agreement and a consulting agreement. Under these proposed agreements, Zhang\u2019s employment with Zhejiang would terminate, and he would be re-engaged by Dahua as an outside consultant, paid hourly for ad hoc projects on an at-will basis. These drafts did not provide compensation for Zhang\u2019s remaining entitlements under the 2015 Employment Agreement. Zhang refused to sign, saying the terms were not what had been discussed with Fu and reminding Attorney Yue that Fu had said the company would \"treat [him] well.\"\n\nAfter further internal discussions, Zhejiang\u2019s attorneys prepared two new letter agreements: (1) a release agreement (the \"Release Agreement\"), and (2) a new employment agreement for Zhang\u2019s role as Senior Corporate Advisor (the \"2017 Employment Agreement\"). Collectively, these are referred to as the \"2017 Agreement.\"\n\nThe Release Agreement purported to \"memorialize[] the terms . . . agreed to with respect to the termination of [the 2015 Employment Agreement]\" and contained a general release of claims, a non-competition clause, a confidentiality provision, and mutual non-disparagement. In exchange for execution, non-revocation, and compliance, the Release Agreement provided:\n\n\"Payments. In consideration for your execution, non-revocation and compliance with this Agreement, the Company agrees to make monthly severance payments to you in the amount of $680,000 for sixteen (16) months following the offer termination [d]ate (the 'Severance Period'), payable subject to standard payroll deductions and withholdings on the Company's ordinary payroll dates over the Severance Period. . . .\"\n\nThe 2017 Employment Agreement described Zhang\u2019s \"new position\" as a Dahua \"Senior Corporate Advisor\" who would participate in forward-looking projects but would not be involved in day-to-day business operations. It set a salary of $10,000 biweekly, equating to $240,000 annually.\n\nAttorney Yue presented both the Release Agreement and the 2017 Employment Agreement together for Zhang and Fu to consider. After about ten to fifteen minutes, Zhang and Fu signed both documents without further discussion. Zhang\u2019s employment as Senior Corporate Advisor began on August 29, 2017.\n\nIn the months that followed, Dahua continued to pay Zhang in monthly amounts consistent with his annual base salary under the 2015 Employment Agreement (effectively $510,000 per year) and the new advisor salary of $240,000 per year under the 2017 Employment Agreement.\n\nOn January 10, 2018, Dahua\u2019s human resources department emailed Zhang informing him of his immediate termination, attaching a new separation and release agreement for him to review and sign. The proposed new agreement would have superseded the 2017 Agreement and provided Zhang with severance payments totaling $910,000.\n\nZhang refused to sign the new agreement and requested acceleration of what he viewed as the agreed severance amount under the Release Agreement. Zhang\u2019s counsel sent a demand letter asserting that under the 2017 Agreement Dahua was \"already contractually obligated to pay Mr. Zhang over $11,000,000.\" Zhejiang\u2019s counsel replied that she had \"just learned\" of a \"scrivener's error\" in the Release Agreement, claiming the language mistakenly provided for a monthly severance payment of $680,000 for 16 months instead of a total severance of $680,000 paid as $42,000 (or $42,500) per month for 16 months. Counsel asked Zhang to sign an amendment to correct the alleged error. Zhang declined. Dahua then initiated this litigation.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Dahua filed a diversity action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that the Release Agreement was unenforceable on the ground that the severance provision contained a scrivener\u2019s error resulting from a mutual mistake of the parties. Dahua sought reformation of the severance provision to reflect what it claimed was the parties\u2019 intent: monthly severance payments of $42,500 for 16 months, totaling $680,000. Dahua also asserted that Zhang breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by insisting that the Release Agreement as written reflected the parties\u2019 intent. Zhang counterclaimed for breach of contract, alleging that Dahua refused to pay him in accordance with the terms of the Release Agreement.",
        "district_court_decision":"On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court initially granted judgment for Dahua on all counts. It found no genuine dispute of material fact that a unilateral, if not mutual, mistake permeated the Release Agreement and ordered reformation of the severance provision as Dahua requested. The court also entered judgment for Dahua on its implied covenant claim. Zhang appealed. The First Circuit vacated the summary judgment in Dahua\u2019s favor, holding that there were several disputed issues of material fact concerning the viability of any mistake defense, and remanded the case.\n\nOn remand, the case was reassigned to a different district judge, and an eleven-day bench trial was held focused on core factual disputes identified by the First Circuit. The parties agreed that the trial should resolve three principal factual questions: (1) whether, at the time of signing, Fu believed he was offering $680,000 per month for 16 months or a total of $680,000 over 16 months; (2) whether Zhang believed Fu was offering $680,000 per month for 16 months or $680,000 total over 16 months; and (3) if Dahua made a drafting mistake, whether Zhang knew or had reason to know of that mistake when he executed the Release Agreement.\n\nAfter trial, the district court answered these factual questions in Dahua\u2019s favor, finding that Dahua made a mistake in setting forth the severance payment as $680,000 per month instead of $680,000 payable over 16 months, and that the mistake was either mutual or that Zhang knew or had reason to know of it. However, the court concluded that, under Massachusetts law, it could not reform or rescind the Release Agreement based on unilateral or mutual mistake in these circumstances. The court held that reformation was unavailable because Dahua had not clearly demonstrated a prior, express agreement that the writing could be reformed to reflect, finding the parties\u2019 pre-signing agreement to be limited to Zhang\u2019s change in role and additional advisor salary while he continued to receive salary and benefits from the 2015 Employment Agreement, without any prior agreement on a release or detailed severance structure.\n\nAs to rescission, the district court concluded that Dahua\u2019s mistake arguments were supported by evidence, including lawyers\u2019 contemporaneous internal communications and the stark discrepancy between an initial offer that provided no severance and the later written provision implying approximately $10.88 million in severance. The court reasoned that this discrepancy should have alerted Zhang to a mistake. Nonetheless, the court found that Dahua bore the risk of the mistake because Dahua and its lawyers drafted the Release Agreement, controlled the information given to drafting counsel, and Fu approved and signed an English-language agreement he could not read. The court also found that equitable considerations weighed against rescission because Zhang had already performed under new restrictive covenants \u2014 including maintaining silence during the company\u2019s strategic acquisition negotiations \u2014 and voiding the severance provision would effectively deprive him of compensation for those covenants.\n\nThe district court therefore entered judgment against Dahua on its claims for reformation and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. It did not immediately enter judgment for Zhang on his breach of contract counterclaim. Instead, it requested additional briefing on whether, having found no prior oral agreement and having found mutual or known unilateral mistake but also that Dahua bore the risk of mistake, it had authority to fashion an equitable remedy or was required to enforce the Release Agreement as written.\n\nIn response, Dahua proposed several equitable approaches intended to avoid what it characterized as an unintended multimillion-dollar windfall to Zhang, including implying a quasi-contract that would provide for total severance of $680,000. Dahua later also argued the court could treat the problem as one of contract interpretation, contending that the severance provision could be viewed as ambiguous in light of the agreement as a whole. The district court rejected Dahua\u2019s interpretive\/ambiguity argument on waiver grounds and, alternatively, on the merits, concluding that the provision unambiguously promised Zhang $680,000 per month for 16 months. The court also found Dahua\u2019s proposed equitable alternatives unpersuasive and held there was no basis to override the severance provision as written. Having determined that the Release Agreement\u2019s terms, including the severance provision, controlled, it entered judgment for Zhang on his breach of contract counterclaim and awarded him $10,200,000 in severance plus prejudgment interest, for a total award of $16,953,787.88.",
        "what_is_appealed":"In this second appeal, Dahua challenges the district court\u2019s rulings following the bench trial and post-trial briefing. Specifically, Dahua appeals the determination that the severance provision of the Release Agreement unambiguously obligated Dahua to pay Zhang $680,000 per month for sixteen months and must be enforced as written; the rejection of Dahua\u2019s late-raised ambiguity\/interpretation theory; the denial of reformation or other equitable relief from the severance provision in light of the court\u2019s factual findings about mistake; and the resulting judgment for Zhang on his breach of contract counterclaim. Dahua\u2019s separate claim that Zhang breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was also litigated and addressed by the district court and is part of the overall appellate posture."

          "When the Release Agreement and the 2017 Employment Agreement are read together as an integrated transaction, the structure and economics of the deal support the interpretation that $680,000 is the total severance. Zhang\u2019s advisor salary is expressed as an annual total ($240,000) and a periodic payment ($10,000 biweekly), whereas the severance provision lists only one dollar figure ($680,000), creating uncertainty about whether it is a total or periodic amount.",
          "Background circumstances and business context make it implausible that Zhejiang intended to pay Zhang more than $10 million in severance \u2014 an amount far in excess of his remaining conditionally guaranteed base salary \u2014 and then also pay him an additional $480,000 as advisor compensation. Such a bargain is not a rational commercial arrangement when contrasted with the initial draft that offered no severance at all. This context demonstrates at least that the provision is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.",
          "Because the provision is ambiguous, the district court should have considered extrinsic evidence of intent, including internal communications and negotiation history, to determine whether the parties meant total severance of $680,000 or monthly installments of that amount. This interpretive inquiry is distinct from and, in some respects, precedes analysis of equitable remedies like reformation or rescission.",
          "The ambiguity\/interpretation argument was not waived. Although Dahua earlier emphasized a mistake\/reformation theory and at times disclaimed relying on ambiguity, it raised the interpretive argument in response to the district court\u2019s explicit post-trial request for briefing on whether the agreement had to be enforced as written. The issue was fully briefed and decided on the merits by the district court, so considering it on appeal would not unfairly prejudice Zhang or undermine judicial economy.",
          "Even under traditional waiver doctrine, the appellate court should consider the ambiguity issue because it is purely legal, arises from the same contractual language that must be construed to review the existing judgment, and is inextricably intertwined with the questions of reformation, rescission, and breach of contract.",
          "Regarding the implied covenant claim, Zhang\u2019s refusal to sign an amendment correcting a perceived scrivener\u2019s error cannot constitute a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Nothing in the 2017 Agreement obliges him to renegotiate or modify its terms, and the covenant cannot be used to impose duties that contradict or go beyond the contract\u2019s express provisions or to police pre-formation understandings.",
          "Zhang\u2019s alleged knowledge of the drafting mistake relates to contract formation, not performance. The implied covenant regulates the performance and enforcement of an existing contract, so using it to sanction Zhang for not disclosing an apparent mistake at the time of signing or for declining to amend the agreement is outside the covenant\u2019s proper scope."

          "Dahua\u2019s alternative reading requires ignoring or diminishing the word \"monthly\" and is not grammatically or commercially the more natural construction. The inclusion of a single dollar amount in the provision is consistent with setting the amount of each monthly payment; the parties knew how to express total and periodic amounts separately, as they did in the advisor salary clause, and did not do so for the severance.",
          "Any claimed ambiguity argument was waived. Throughout most of the litigation, Dahua expressly disclaimed an ambiguity theory and focused instead on reformation and mistake. Only after trial, when the district court solicited briefing on equitable remedies versus enforcing the agreement as written, did Dahua raise ambiguity. That sequence makes the ambiguity claim an untimely, \"delinquent\" argument that should not be considered on appeal.",
          "Because Dahua chose to litigate on a mistake\/reformation theory and not on contract interpretation, it should be held to that strategic choice and not allowed to shift theories after adverse factual findings. Allowing this late pivot undermines waiver doctrine and is unfair to Zhang, who framed his trial strategy around the issues Dahua actually presented.",
          "On mistake and equitable relief, Zhang maintains that the district court\u2019s factual findings already grant all the relief equitable doctrines could support. The court found that Dahua bore the risk of any drafting mistake, having controlled the drafting process through its lawyers and having chosen the language, and that equitable considerations counseled against rescission or quasi-contract remedies because Zhang had already performed under the restrictive covenants, providing Dahua with substantial benefits.",
          "Regarding the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Zhang argues that his conduct did not breach any implied duty. The 2017 Agreement does not impose an obligation to renegotiate or correct drafting errors after execution, and an implied covenant claim cannot be used to compel a party to forgo or modify rights clearly provided in the written contract. Moreover, any alleged bad faith related to recognizing and not disclosing Dahua\u2019s drafting error at the formation stage is not actionable under the implied covenant, which governs performance and enforcement, not pre-contract negotiations."

The phrase \"make monthly severance payments to you in the amount of $680,000 for sixteen (16) months\" is, in ordinary English, most naturally read to set the amount of each monthly payment at $680,000, made over sixteen months. Reading $680,000 as the total, paid monthly, would either render \"monthly\" surplusage or force an unnatural parsing (\"make [monthly] severance payments ... in the amount of $680,000 total\"), which the text does not say. The district court also read the two agreements together and still found no textual foothold for treating $680,000 as a total rather than the payment amount. While the commercial implausibility of a >$10 million severance is strong evidence of mistake, it does not by itself create a second reasonable textual meaning; it supports a mistake theory, not ambiguity. Given Massachusetts\u2019 emphasis on giving effect to all words and enforcing clear language even if the bargain later appears improvident, an appellate court is likely to agree that the provision is unambiguous and means sixteen monthly payments of $680,000."

Dahua litigated the case through summary judgment, a prior appeal, and an eleven-day bench trial on a pure mistake\/reformation theory, at times explicitly disavowing an interpretation\/ambiguity argument. Only after losing on reformation and rescission did it pivot in post-trial briefing to argue that the severance clause was ambiguous and should be interpreted using extrinsic evidence. The district court treated this as waived as a new, late-raised theory. That application of waiver doctrine falls well within the normal, \"hold-the-party-to-its-strategy\" range. Even though the court also addressed ambiguity on the merits in the alternative, that does not cure the lateness. Nor is this an exceptional case compelling the appellate court to overlook waiver; the new theory could have materially affected how evidence and cross-examination were framed at trial. The First Circuit is therefore likely to uphold the district court\u2019s waiver ruling and, alternatively, its determination that the provision is not ambiguous."

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"The factual findings\u2014(a) that the written severance amount did not reflect either party\u2019s actual intended economic deal, (b) that Zhang at least knew or had reason to know of the error, and (c) that Dahua bore the risk of the drafting mistake\u2014are reviewed for clear error and are strongly supported by the record as summarized: internal emails predating the final draft, the huge gap between the earlier no\u2011severance proposal and the $10+ million written severance, and Dahua\u2019s exclusive control of drafting. On those findings, Massachusetts law sharply limits equitable relief. Reformation requires proof of a definite prior express agreement that the writing fails to capture; the district court found no such express agreement on a release or specific severance structure, only a general understanding that Zhang\u2019s role and advisor salary would change while his existing salary\/benefits continued. That is insufficient under settled Massachusetts precedent, so refusing reformation is legally correct. Rescission for mistake is likewise unavailable where the mistaken party bears the risk of the mistake, as the district court explicitly found, and where equities (here, Zhang\u2019s full performance under restrictive covenants, including silence during a strategic acquisition) would make unwinding one-sided and punitive. The court reasonably concluded Dahua had assumed the drafting risk and that rescission or quasi\u2011contract would improperly rewrite a clear, integrated bargain after the other party had fully performed. Those are classic discretionary equitable determinations, and on this record an appellate court is unlikely to find an abuse of discretion or legal error in concluding it was compelled to enforce the severance clause as written and to reject reformation, rescission, or quasi\u2011contract relief."

The district court ultimately entered judgment against Dahua on its implied covenant claim, and that ruling accords with Massachusetts doctrine: the covenant governs performance and enforcement of an existing contract and does not impose a duty to renegotiate, correct perceived drafting errors, or surrender contract rights once the agreement is in place. Zhang\u2019s refusal to sign an amendment and his insistence that Dahua comply with the written Release Agreement are exactly the type of conduct that courts routinely hold cannot constitute bad faith; a party may stand on the contract it negotiated absent a specific duty to amend. Any alleged opportunism in recognizing a mistake at the moment of signing goes to formation and is outside the covenant\u2019s reach. An appellate court is therefore likely to affirm the rejection of Dahua\u2019s implied covenant claim."

      "overall_outcome":"AFFIRM",

      "reasoning":"The key turning point is that, after remand from the first appeal, Dahua had its opportunity to prove mistake and secure equitable relief and largely succeeded on facts but failed on law and equity: the district court found a drafting error but also that Dahua assumed the risk and that Massachusetts law did not permit reformation or rescission on these facts. Those legal conclusions are well-grounded in Massachusetts cases requiring a prior express agreement for reformation and denying rescission where the mistaken party bears the risk. The court then enforced the contract as written, entering a very large award for Zhang. On this second appeal, Dahua\u2019s main attempt to avoid that result is to recharacterize the problem as one of ambiguity\/interpretation instead of pure mistake. That theory was raised only after trial, was reasonably deemed waived, and in any event is weak on the contract\u2019s actual wording. The implied covenant issue cuts strongly against Dahua: Massachusetts law does not obligate Zhang to correct or renegotiate a written contract to his detriment. Given the deferential standards (clear error for factual findings; abuse of discretion on waiver and equitable relief) and the unfavorable substantive contract and equity doctrines, the appellate court is most likely to affirm across all issues, leaving intact the district court\u2019s enforcement of the severance clause and the judgment on Zhang\u2019s counterclaim, while also affirming the rejection of Dahua\u2019s implied covenant claim."

      },
      "factual_background":"Before the onset of his mental health symptoms, Govanni R. Nunez worked full time as a security guard for the New York Public Library, stationed at the library\u2019s Fifth Avenue entrance where he checked patrons for weapons and contraband. His formal education was limited; he had been in special education classes through the fifth grade and then dropped out due to instability at home.\n\nIn 2013, at age 35, Nunez experienced his first panic attack while riding the subway to work. Since that time, he has suffered panic symptoms in enclosed spaces, especially on the subway. His panic attacks generally last 5 to 20 minutes and cause tachycardia, palpitations, cold sweats, nausea, shortness of breath, and tingling in his extremities.\n\nNunez has been treated for anxiety and panic attacks since at least November 2016. He was initially prescribed Lexapro (escitalopram), to which he responded well and was symptom free for about a year. After tapering off Lexapro, his symptoms reemerged in June 2018. Although he resumed Lexapro by August 2018, he continued to have panic attacks, including at work as a security guard, sometimes requiring him to leave his security post during work hours. His medications also made him drowsy, and he began falling asleep during his shifts. On August 22, 2018, the library terminated his employment, telling him he was having too many panic attacks on the job.\n\nTo address his panic attacks, Nunez was also prescribed Atarax (hydroxyzine) as an \"emergency\" medication to take when he felt a panic attack coming on. By the time of the administrative hearing, he was taking Atarax three to four times a day because of the frequency of his panic attacks, and he reported that it caused him to fall asleep 35 to 40 minutes after ingestion, making him feel as though his \"whole life\" was spent sleeping.\n\nAt the administrative hearing, Nunez testified that his condition had worsened over time and that mornings were especially difficult because he often woke up \"shaking with tremors\" and feeling heat in his body and chest with shortness of breath. In 2019 he woke up with these symptoms almost every day. He reported that going outside, taking the train, and taking the bus provoked his anxiety and panic attacks. He estimated that in a typical week he had only two or three good days without panic attacks. He used those better days to do chores and necessary errands. On days when he had the energy, he would walk short distances (typically two to three blocks before becoming too tired), go to a church located across the street from his home (sometimes leaving in the middle of mass because he felt unwell), and visit family members who would pick him up by car because panic attacks prevented him from driving himself.\n\nThe record also includes extensive mental health treatment and evaluation evidence. Nunez\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Patrick Schulte, saw him frequently in 2018 and 2019 and documented chronic anxiety, recurring morning panic attacks, shortness of breath on public transportation, and difficulties completing therapeutic homework involving practicing subway travel. Treatment notes show intermittent improvement with medication and therapy, interspersed with regressions and missed appointments due to anxiety. Group-therapy notes reflect reports that he sometimes felt less anxious and benefited from coping strategies. Other examining and consulting professionals \u2014 Dr. L. Blackwell (DDS consultant), Dr. Glenn Bromley (SSA consultative psychiatrist), Dr. Solomon Miskin (examining psychiatrist), and Dr. James K. Ellis (examining psychologist) \u2014 evaluated his mental health and variously opined on his ability to concentrate, sustain an ordinary work routine, maintain regular attendance, perform activities within a schedule, and use public transportation. Across these opinions, each source identified at least moderate limitations in his ability to stay on task and\/or maintain regular work attendance, and some opined he would miss two or more days of work per month.\n\nAt the administrative hearing, a vocational expert testified about the work-related impact of such limitations. In response to hypotheticals from the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and Nunez\u2019s attorney, the expert testified that an unskilled worker with Nunez\u2019s vocational profile could not maintain employment if off task for more than 10 percent of the workday or if absent more than one day per month. The expert also testified that, given certain nonexertional limitations described by the ALJ (including a need for a goal\u2011oriented rather than strictly pace\u2011controlled setting and only occasional interaction with the public), an individual like Nunez could not perform his past work as a security guard but could perform certain other unskilled jobs such as final assembler, hand packager, or assembler of products.",

He alleged an onset date of August 22, 2018, the date he was terminated from his security guard position due to his panic attacks. His applications asserted both physical and mental impairments, but on appeal only his mental health impairments (primarily anxiety, agoraphobia with panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder) are at issue.",

On August 14, 2019, ALJ Angela Banks held a hearing with Nunez, his counsel, and a vocational expert. On November 14, 2019, the ALJ issued a written decision using the SSA\u2019s five\u2011step sequential evaluation. The ALJ found that Nunez was insured for benefits through December 31, 2022, and had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since August 22, 2018. At step two, the ALJ found severe impairments of asthma, agoraphobia with panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. At step three, the ALJ found that these impairments did not meet or equal a listed impairment after assessing the four broad functional areas for mental impairments and determining, among other things, that Nunez had a \"moderate\" limitation in concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace. The ALJ then assessed a residual functional capacity (RFC) for a full range of work at all exertional levels with specified nonexertional limitations: the ability to understand, remember, and carry out instructions for jobs learnable in up to 30 days; a requirement for a goal\u2011oriented setting rather than a job requiring a specific constant pace throughout the workday; and tolerance for only occasional interaction with the public while remaining able to interact appropriately with supervisors and coworkers. In formulating this RFC, the ALJ evaluated five medical opinions, expressly analyzing four of them (from Drs. Schulte, Blackwell, Bromley, and Ellis) for \"persuasiveness\" under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c. The ALJ found most of these opinions \"not persuasive\" due to perceived inconsistencies or lack of support, but found Dr. Bromley\u2019s findings of mild to moderate limitations in sustaining concentration, ordinary routine, and regular attendance to be persuasive, while rejecting his findings of more severe limitations in other domains. Relying on the RFC and vocational expert testimony, the ALJ found at step four that Nunez could not perform his past relevant work as a security guard but concluded at step five that there were significant numbers of other unskilled jobs in the national economy that he could perform, such as final assembler, packager, and product assembler. Nunez sought review by the Appeals Council, which denied review on January 14, 2021, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. On March 17, 2021, Nunez filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. On March 30, 2023, Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and upheld the denial of benefits.",

The appeal thus focuses on whether the ALJ correctly applied the legal standards governing RFC assessment, evaluation of medical opinions under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c, and consideration of claimant testimony, particularly as these relate to his ability to sustain concentration, maintain an ordinary work routine, and have regular attendance."

          "With respect to the medical opinions, the Commissioner contends that the ALJ acted within her discretion under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520c in finding certain opinions less persuasive due to perceived lack of support in objective findings or inconsistency with the broader record, while crediting those parts of Dr. Bromley\u2019s opinion that aligned with the documented course of treatment and clinical observations.",

          "The Commissioner further argues that the hypothetical questions posed to the vocational expert adequately reflected the limitations the ALJ found credible and supported by the record, and that the expert\u2019s responses identifying jobs such as final assembler, hand packager, and assembler of products provided substantial evidence at step five that there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that Nunez can perform with the RFC found by the ALJ."

          "reasoning":"The ALJ was required under \u00a7 404.1520c to explain supportability and consistency for each medical source and to avoid mischaracterizing significant, probative evidence. The decision repeatedly discounts opinions\u2014including the treating psychiatrist\u2019s and those of examining sources\u2014as unsupported or inconsistent because they rely on subjective reports or because some treatment notes show improvement. Yet psychiatric practice necessarily relies on self\u2011report, and the longitudinal records document chronic anxiety, recurrent morning panic attacks, difficulty using public transportation, missed appointments due to anxiety, and only intermittent, often short\u2011lived improvement with medication. The various opinions are broadly consistent with each other and with those longitudinal notes: all found at least moderate limitations in concentration, routine, and\/or attendance, and several anticipated more than one absence per month. The ALJ characterized this as inconsistent with the \u201coverall record\u201d without grappling with those key consistencies or with the cyclical nature of Nunez\u2019s symptoms, instead relying heavily on isolated references to doing \u201cbetter\u201d or being \u201chelped\u201d by medication. This selective reading and the perfunctory rejection of every opinion that quantified likely absences, while adopting only the mildest limitations, reflect a legal error in applying the regulatory factors and a lack of a reasoned bridge from the evidence to the RFC.

But the underlying records show that he still experienced frequent panic attacks, often in the morning and in connection with leaving home or using public transportation, sometimes needed to abandon bus or subway rides, could not travel alone reliably, had only two or three \u201cgood days\u201d per week, and took a sedating \u201cemergency\u201d medication three to four times a day that often made him fall asleep. In the mental\u2011health context, improvement with treatment and intermittent functioning are not inconsistent with disability, and the ability to perform sporadic daily tasks does not equate to the capacity for sustained full\u2011time competitive work. By treating those limited activities and episodic improvement as inconsistent with Nunez\u2019s description of disabling symptoms\u2014without addressing the frequency, duration, and functional impact of his bad days and morning panic attacks\u2014the ALJ relied on selective evidence and effectively equated minimal daily functioning with work capacity. That approach conflicts with the governing symptom\u2011evaluation standards and Second Circuit precedent. The credibility\/symptom evaluation thus lacks substantial evidentiary support and was not adequately explained, warranting remand."

The RFC\u2019s implicit assumptions about on\u2011task time and attendance are outcome\u2011determinative because the VE testified that exceeding a 10% off\u2011task rate or missing more than one day per month eliminates the identified unskilled jobs. Yet no medical source supports such stringent functional capacity; to the contrary, every source finds significant, work\u2011relevant limitations, with some explicitly projecting more than one absence per month. The ALJ rejected or minimized each of those opinions by characterizing them as unsupported or inconsistent, but did so through selective reliance on isolated indications of improvement and limited daily activities, without confronting the longitudinal evidence of chronic panic attacks, sedating medication, and difficulty using public transportation or maintaining routine. This reflects both a misapplication of \u00a7 404.1520c (issue 2) and an inadequately reasoned symptom evaluation (issue 3). Once those errors are recognized, the remaining record cannot substantially support the specific on\u2011task and attendance findings embedded in the RFC (issue 1), and the Commissioner therefore fails to meet the step\u2011five burden. The likely appellate result is reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment and remand to the agency for further proceedings consistent with the opinion, rather than a direct award of benefits, because the panel will typically leave it to the agency to reevaluate the medical and testimonial evidence, reformulate the RFC, and obtain new vocational testimony as needed."

      },
      "factual_background":"Jessica Silveira da Silva (Silveira) and Edervaldo Rodrigues da Silva (Rodrigues) are natives and citizens of Brazil. They married on May 13, 2011, and lived in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. About three years into the marriage, their son A.R. was born. The couple separated in 2016. Although they remained legally married for some time, they lived apart: Rodrigues moved to his mother's home in a nearby town, while Silveira, who was A.R.'s primary caretaker, eventually moved in with her own mother. During this period, Rodrigues visited A.R. about two weekends per month.\n\nSilveira asserts that she separated from Rodrigues because of domestic issues, including domestic abuse. Rodrigues denies abuse and maintains that the separation was due to infidelity. In 2021, Silveira began a romantic relationship with Gilberto Lucas (Lucas). Shortly after the relationship began, Lucas immigrated to the United States while Silveira and A.R. remained in Brazil. Silveira and Rodrigues legally divorced on December 10, 2021. Under the divorce terms, they shared custody of A.R., but A.R. would continue to live with Silveira.\n\nIn the months following the divorce, Silveira told Rodrigues that she wanted to travel to the United States. Rodrigues acknowledges that she expressed a desire to travel but disputes that she told him she intended to permanently reside there with A.R. Rodrigues signed a passport application for A.R. that included authorization for the child to travel outside Brazil. As time passed, Rodrigues became suspicious that Silveira intended to leave Brazil with A.R. He attempted to cancel A.R.'s passport around March 17, 2022, but that attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nOn or about March 28, 2022, Silveira and A.R. left Brazil. They flew first to Colombia and then to Mexico. On April 3, 2022, they crossed the Mexico\u2013United States border and then traveled to Massachusetts, ultimately settling in Lowell. Silveira has since applied for asylum in the United States. Meanwhile, unaware that Silveira and A.R. had already departed, Rodrigues filed a report with the Brazilian police on March 30, 2022, expressing fear that Silveira would unlawfully take A.R. out of Brazil. In April 2022, a family member informed Rodrigues that A.R. had left Brazil, and Rodrigues later confirmed via social media that Silveira and A.R. were living in Lowell. For a period, Rodrigues and A.R. did not communicate regularly; at the time of the appeal, they were having video calls about three times a week.\n\nIn the United States, Silveira and A.R. began living with Lucas in Lowell and have lived together continuously, moving once but remaining within Lowell and within the same school district. During their first year in Lowell, Silveira and A.R. lived with Lucas, Lucas's brother, Gilmar Junior Torres dos Santos, and Gilmar's wife, Bruna Coutinho Suarez dos Santos. Both Silveira and Lucas have steady jobs and incomes. Silveira married Lucas on September 18, 2024. Silveira described A.R.'s relationship with Lucas as \"good\" and \"healthy,\" and testified that Lucas spends one-on-one and family time with A.R. Although Silveira has no blood relatives in the United States, Lucas has extended family in Massachusetts, including an aunt, a brother, a brother-in-law, several cousins, and a cousin's child around A.R.'s age with whom A.R. plays at gatherings. Lucas's brother and sister-in-law testified that they consider A.R. their nephew, saw him regularly (including caring for him after school during the first year in Lowell), and continue to see him about twice a month after moving to nearby Gloucester. They stated they would be willing to assist A.R. financially if needed. A.R. spends holidays and other special occasions with Lucas's extended family.\n\nBefore moving to the United States, A.R. had about one year of schooling in Brazil, much of it at home due to the COVID\u201119 pandemic, and he did not learn to read or write in Portuguese. After arriving in Lowell, A.R. began attending an elementary school there and has remained at the same school. He progressed to the fourth grade by the time of trial. In his first year of school in Lowell, A.R. had difficulty adjusting to the classroom environment and meeting Massachusetts curriculum standards. The record reflects that he was frequently distracted, exhibited disruptive behavior, and disturbed classmates' learning. He also struggled academically, and his limited English skills hampered his progress.\n\nBy his second year in school (third grade), A.R. showed significant improvement. Although his attendance presented some issues, his teacher, Sarah Hoey, testified that he had grown in many ways during the year, was meeting classroom expectations by the middle of the school year, and that his English had improved to the point where he served as an \"interpreter\" for other Brazilian students who struggled with English. Nonetheless, his attendance record showed he missed ten days of school in his first year and nineteen days in his second. His report card showed performance below curriculum standards in some areas, and there was conflicting testimony about the degree of his English proficiency and behavior.\n\nOutside school, A.R. participates in community and social activities. Lowell has a sizeable Brazilian community, and Silveira testified that A.R. has about five Brazilian friends. A.R. attends church regularly, participating in a youth group, and by the time of trial had been practicing with a local soccer team twice a week for about three months.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"A little over two years after Silveira brought A.R. to the United States, Rodrigues filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and its implementing statute, the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (ICARA), seeking the return of A.R. to Brazil. He named both Silveira and Silveira's then-partner (now husband), Lucas, as respondents. The petition alleged that A.R. had been wrongfully removed from his country of habitual residence. In response, Silveira raised three affirmative defenses under the Hague Convention: (1) that Rodrigues had consented to the removal; (2) that A.R. was \"now settled\" in the United States, given the passage of more than one year since the removal and A.R.'s integration into his new environment; and (3) that returning A.R. would expose him to a \"grave risk\" of harm.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court held a three-day bench trial in October 2024, hearing testimony from multiple witnesses, including Silveira, members of Lucas's family, and A.R.'s teacher, and receiving documentary evidence such as school records and immigration-related information. During trial, the court granted Silveira's motion to dismiss Lucas as a respondent. After trial, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. It determined that Rodrigues met his prima facie burden under the Hague Convention and ICARA to show that A.R. was wrongfully removed from Brazil. It then analyzed each of the three asserted defenses: consent, \"now settled,\" and grave risk, and rejected all three. As relevant here, the court first found that Rodrigues' petition was filed more than one year after A.R.'s removal from Brazil, satisfying the temporal prerequisite for considering the \"now settled\" defense. It then applied a multi-factor, totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to assess whether A.R. was \"now settled\" in the United States. The court considered A.R.'s age; the stability and duration of his residence in the United States; his school attendance and performance; his friendships and relationships with relatives in the new area; his participation in community and extracurricular activities; Silveira's employment and financial stability; and the immigration status of Silveira and A.R. The court found some factors favorable to Silveira (including A.R.'s age, stability of residence, and household financial stability), but it gave negative or limited weight to others, such as the relative newness and perceived strength of A.R.'s relationships with extended family in the United States, gaps and issues in his school attendance and academic performance, questions about the quality and depth of his friendships and his relationship with his stepfather, and the relatively short duration and limited extent of his extracurricular involvement. Although the court noted that there was no apparent immediate threat of deportation, it ultimately concluded that Silveira had not carried her burden to demonstrate that A.R. was \"now settled\" and, on that basis, ordered Silveira to make arrangements to return A.R. to Brazil. The court stayed the return order until July 1, 2025.",

She emphasizes that A.R. has consistently lived with her and Lucas in a stable household, that both adults have steady employment and income, and that A.R. has a healthy relationship with his stepfather. She underscores the support and involvement of Lucas's extended family, including a step-uncle and step-aunt who cared for A.R. regularly, continue to see him twice a month, and consider him a nephew. She also argues that the district court undervalued evidence of A.R.'s significant academic and behavioral improvements at school, his progression through grade levels, his growing English-language proficiency (including his role as an interpreter for Brazilian peers), and his participation in community activities such as church youth group and a soccer team, all of which, she contends, show that A.R. has developed strong ties and is integrated into his current environment.",

He also points to A.R.'s school history\u2014his notable number of absences, disruptive behavior, and below-standard academic performance\u2014and the relatively short and limited nature of his extracurricular participation (only a few months on a soccer team and twice-monthly church attendance) as evidence that A.R. is still struggling to adapt and has not yet established the stable, permanent ties required to be considered \"now settled.\"",

The court did not ignore favorable evidence; it weighed it and found it insufficient to meet Silveira\u2019s burden. On this mixed record, a different factfinder might reasonably reach the opposite conclusion, but that is not enough for clear error.

In spring 2014, Buyer Group 1 proposed $6.90 per ADS but refused to increase its offer when the Special Committee sought a higher price. Buyer Group 2 formed in April 2014 and continued negotiations. In fall 2014, Buyer Group 3 formed and included Ningxia, which ultimately controlled about 42% of Shanda\u2019s voting power; in September 2014 this group indicated it would increase its offer to $7.10 per ADS.\n\nLeadership changes occurred around this time. Shanda\u2019s then\u2011CEO resigned and left the board at the end of October 2014. Internal executive Yingfeng Zhang became CEO and later bought sufficient voting shares to become, alongside Ningxia, a dominant shareholder. Zhang and Ningxia joined with others to form Buyer Group 4, which controlled approximately 90% of the shareholder votes. Shanda\u2019s board chair, Tiangqiao Chen, resigned; Zhang was appointed board chair. Ningxia\u2019s board chair initially filled the board vacancy left by the prior CEO, and in February 2015 that representative resigned and was replaced on Shanda\u2019s board by Liang, a Ningxia vice general manager.\n\nIn March 2015, Buyer Group 4 proposed to acquire the company at $6.90 per ADS. To evaluate that proposal, management, including Zhang, supplied a new set of internal financial projections (the March 2015 Projections) to the Special Committee and Merrill Lynch. These projections, covering 2014\u20132019, reflected a more pessimistic outlook than the earlier projections and were prepared using a different methodology. In particular, Shanda had historically calculated depreciation and amortization by writing down fixed assets over their useful lives. The March 2015 Projections instead calculated depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue, which allegedly violated basic accounting principles and produced implausible results, including a negative projected net book value for capital assets in 2018. The March 2015 Projections also estimated MIIM\u2019s total lifetime revenue at only $15 million, despite Mir II\u2019s historical success and Shanda\u2019s substantial investment in MIIM and knowledge of strong testing, pre\u2011orders, and social media indicators suggesting high demand.\n\nAfter discussions with Merrill Lynch, the Special Committee sought a $7.10 per ADS price from Buyer Group 4. Buyer Group 4 agreed; Merrill Lynch then delivered a fairness opinion stating that the $7.10 merger price was fair, based on the projections provided by management. Relying on that opinion and the March 2015 Projections, the Special Committee and then the full board concluded that the Freeze\u2011Out Merger and $7.10 price were fair and in the best interests of the company and unaffiliated holders, notwithstanding what plaintiffs allege was the board\u2019s knowledge that the March 2015 Projections were seriously flawed. The board approved the merger agreement.\n\nAlthough Buyer Group 4 already controlled enough votes to approve the merger under Cayman law, Shanda convened an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) for November 18, 2015 to hold the shareholder vote. Under Cayman Islands Companies Law \u00a7 238, minority shareholders who objected could dissent and seek a judicial appraisal of the \u201cfair value\u201d of their shares instead of accepting the merger price. To inform shareholders ahead of the EGM and their decision whether to sell, tender, or dissent, Shanda issued an Initial Proxy on May 5, 2015 and a Final Proxy on October 13, 2015 (collectively, the \u201cProxies\u201d).\n\nThe Proxies contained charts summarizing the March 2014 and March 2015 Projections. The March 2014 Projections presented data for fiscal years 2013\u20132018; the March 2015 Projections, as disclosed in the Proxies, covered 2014\u20132019. In fact, management had provided Merrill Lynch with additional projections data for 2020 showing continued revenue growth, but the Proxies did not include that year. The Proxies described the projections as summaries of the projections supplied to Merrill Lynch and the buyer group.\n\nThe Proxies also described the methodology used to prepare the projections and stated that in compiling the projections, management projected revenues for each new game, and that the projections were based on assumptions and estimates management believed reasonable and represented management\u2019s best available estimates and good\u2011faith judgments at the time. The Proxies further stated that the Special Committee and board had determined that the merger, the merger agreement, and related transactions were fair to and in the best interests of the company and its unaffiliated security holders, and that the company believed the transaction was fair on that basis.\n\nBetween the Initial and Final Proxies, Shanda launched MIIM on August 3, 2015. MIIM was highly successful almost immediately. Within two weeks it was the top\u2011selling game on Apple\u2019s iOS App Store, and it generated over $90 million in revenue each month following launch. Shanda\u2019s internal systems allowed management and directors to monitor in\u2011game purchase and revenue data in real time, and the complaint alleges that this information was known across the company, including to the Special Committee and board, before the Final Proxy was issued. The Final Proxy stated that the March 2015 Projections had not been updated but did not disclose the extent to which MIIM\u2019s actual revenues had already far exceeded the lifetime revenue assumptions embedded in the projections.\n\nAt the November 18, 2015 EGM, Buyer Group 4 voted its shares to approve the Freeze\u2011Out Merger. All ADS held by minority shareholders who had not sold earlier in the class period (the \u201cTenderers,\u201d including Monk) were cashed out for $7.10 per ADS, and the ADS were thereafter cancelled and delisted from NASDAQ. A small number of minority shareholders (the \u201cDissenters\u201d) had objected to the merger and pursued an appraisal action in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands under \u00a7 238 (the \u201cAppraisal Action\u201d). During that litigation, alleged flaws in the March 2015 Projections regarding depreciation, amortization, MIIM revenue estimates, and other issues were aired. The Cayman courts ultimately determined that the $7.10 merger price did not represent the fair value of the shares and awarded the Dissenters a significantly higher per\u2011share amount. Monk and the putative class of Tenderers allege that, had they not been misled, they would have dissented and secured similar appraisal relief, rather than accepting the merger consideration.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On March 19, 2018, Astor BK Realty Trust filed a putative federal securities class action in the Southern District of New York regarding the Shanda Freeze\u2011Out Merger. The complaint asserted claims under Sections 10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b\u20115, alleging that Shanda and various individual officers and directors made material misstatements and omissions in proxy materials and related disclosures in order to conceal that the $7.10 merger price was substantially below the fair value of Shanda\u2019s shares and to discourage the exercise of appraisal rights. The insider\u2011trading claims under Section 20A were asserted against Shanda, Zhang, and two transaction entities created to effect the merger (Capitalhold Limited and Capitalcorp Limited). The putative class, as defined in the operative complaint, included both Tenderers (those who held through the merger and were cashed out) and \u201cSellers\u201d (those who sold Shanda securities on the market during the alleged class period). David Monk, a Tenderer, was later appointed lead plaintiff.",
        "district_court_decision":"On June 1, 2018, the district court appointed David Monk as lead plaintiff. Monk filed an amended complaint in 2018. Shanda moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On September 30, 2019 (In re Shanda I), the district court granted the motion to dismiss all claims. The court held, among other things, that Monk had not adequately pleaded reliance because, after the merger announcement, the ADS market was not efficient, precluding use of the fraud\u2011on\u2011the\u2011market presumption. The court nonetheless found two categories of alleged misstatements adequately pleaded as to materiality and falsity: (1) the Proxies\u2019 opinion that the March 2015 Projections were reasonably prepared, in light of the challenged amortization and depreciation inputs; and (2) the description of the March 2015 Projections as a summary of information that omitted the 2020 data provided to Merrill Lynch. The court determined that statements characterizing the merger as 'fair' were non\u2011actionable statements of opinion under the standards it applied. Monk moved for reconsideration. In a September 30, 2020 decision (In re Shanda II), the district court held that Shanda\u2019s failure to disclose detailed MIIM revenue before the EGM was not an actionable omission because, in the court\u2019s view, Cayman law did not impose a duty to disclose that information. The court denied reconsideration on that omission theory, but around the same time granted leave for Monk to file a second amended complaint while denying, without elaboration, his request to add Altimeo Asset Management, a 'Seller' investor, as an additional lead plaintiff.\n\nMonk filed the Second Amended Complaint (the 'Complaint') on October 23, 2020, refining the class allegations and elaborating his economic\u2011loss and market\u2011efficiency theories. Shanda and Zhang again moved to dismiss. In a March 31, 2022 opinion (In re Shanda III), the district court again dismissed the claims against Shanda and the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b\u20115 claims against the individual defendants for failure to state a claim. In that later ruling, the court accepted that the amended allegations adequately pleaded an efficient market and thus allowed Monk, in principle, to invoke the fraud\u2011on\u2011the\u2011market presumption for reliance. The court continued to treat certain asserted misstatements (including the accounting\/projections issues and summary representation) as sufficiently pleaded and others (including some fairness\u2011opinion and MIIM\u2011omission theories) as not actionable. However, it dismissed on the ground that Monk had not adequately pleaded loss causation, finding that the Complaint lacked plausible, specific allegations explaining how or why Monk himself had been induced to tender his shares and forgo appraisal rights as a result of the alleged misrepresentations. Earlier, the district court had also dismissed or declined to revive the insider\u2011trading claims under Section 20A against Shanda, Capitalhold, and Capitalcorp; Monk did not appeal the dismissal of those insider\u2011trading claims against the entities, and the Section 20A claim against Zhang was not within the scope of this appeal.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Monk filed a timely appeal from the dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint and from the district court\u2019s prior denial of leave to add Altimeo Asset Management as an additional named plaintiff. On appeal, Monk challenges: (1) the district court\u2019s ruling that he failed to plead loss causation; (2) the district court\u2019s determinations that several categories of alleged misstatements and an omission in the Proxies (relating to the projections methodology, MIIM revenue assumptions, completeness of the projections summary, and fairness opinions) were not actionable; and (3) the earlier denial of his motion to amend to add Altimeo. Defendants ask the Court of Appeals to uphold dismissal on the district court\u2019s loss\u2011causation rationale or alternatively on the grounds that Section 10(b) does not apply extraterritorially to these transactions, or that Monk failed adequately to plead a domestic transaction, material misstatements, reliance, or scienter. Monk\u2019s appeal does not contest the dismissal of Section 20A insider\u2011trading claims against Shanda, Capitalhold, and Capitalcorp, and it does not place the insider\u2011trading claims against Zhang at issue."

He contends that City of Pontiac\u2019s limitation is narrow and only excludes claims based on purchases of foreign\u2011issued shares on foreign exchanges, not securities traded exclusively on a U.S. exchange.",
          "He contends that the Proxies contained multiple materially misleading statements regarding the preparation and content of the March 2015 Projections. According to Monk, the statements that projections were based on 'projected revenues for each new game' and were 'reasonably prepared' using 'best available estimates' and 'good faith judgments' conveyed that individualized, game\u2011level revenue forecasting was conducted using accepted financial methodologies. He alleges that, in reality, management changed its methodology by grouping games into broad categories and, more critically, used an improper depreciation and amortization method that treated these non\u2011cash expenses as a fixed percentage of revenue, violating basic accounting principles and generating nonsensical negative capital asset values, thereby materially understating Shanda\u2019s value.",
          "He further asserts that the projections presented in the Proxies, in particular the MIIM lifetime\u2011revenue estimate of only $15 million, were opinion statements that Shanda did not genuinely believe. He points to Mir II\u2019s nearly $2 billion in historical revenue, Shanda\u2019s heavy investment in MIIM, highly favorable internal testing, strong pre\u2011launch demand indicators, and contemporaneous public praise of the mobile games sector and MIIM. Monk argues these facts show that management could not have honestly believed MIIM would generate only $15 million over its life and that the company knew this low estimate materially understated MIIM\u2019s likely contribution to Shanda\u2019s value.",
          "Monk maintains that the Proxies\u2019 description of the March 2015 Projections as a 'summary' of the information given to Merrill Lynch and the buyer group was misleading because Shanda had supplied Merrill Lynch with 2020 projections data showing continued growth, yet omitted 2020 from the public tables. He contends that omitting one year out of five from the disclosed forecast meaningfully understated the company\u2019s long\u2011term growth prospects and misled investors about what information the Special Committee and Merrill Lynch had actually considered.",

As to the Initial Proxy, he contends that board members knew the projections rested on flawed depreciation and amortization assumptions and an unrealistically pessimistic MIIM revenue estimate, yet still adopted Merrill Lynch\u2019s fairness opinion based on those projections. As to the Final Proxy, he emphasizes that by October 2015, MIIM had already generated over $90 million per month since launch, and management could see real\u2011time revenue data, so they knew that a key assumption underlying the fairness opinion (MIIM\u2019s modest projected revenue) was badly wrong. In his view, continuing to characterize the deal as 'fair' in light of this contradictory information rendered the fairness opinions misleading.",
          "On omissions, Monk asserts that, under Cayman law (as interpreted through Davis v. Scottish Re and Sharp v. Blank), directors owed shareholders a duty of 'sufficient information' that included not misleading them and providing essential information for decisions such as whether to dissent and seek appraisal. He argues that this duty required disclosure of MIIM\u2019s actual post\u2011launch revenue performance, and Shanda\u2019s failure to update the projections or disclose the scale of the misestimation of MIIM\u2019s revenue constituted an actionable omission.",
          "On scienter, he argues that Zhang (CEO\/chair and member of Buyer Group 4) and Liang (Ningxia\u2019s representative on the board and a senior Ningxia manager) had a specific, concrete financial motive to keep the merger price low because, as part of the buyer group, they effectively benefited by paying less to acquire Shanda and thus preserving more value for themselves post\u2011merger. He emphasizes that this motive is more specific than generic executive incentives and that their positions gave them both the opportunity and authority to influence the projections and Proxies. He also contends that the alleged fraud benefitted Shanda by preserving capital in the transaction, so the adverse interest exception to imputing their scienter to the company does not apply.",

He argues that although he did not buy or sell on the market during the class period, he relied on the market price as an indicator of value in deciding not to dissent and seek appraisal, and that in an efficient market, truthful projections and fairness disclosures would have bid the price up and\/or encouraged investors interested in appraisal arbitrage to buy in, altering his incentives. He analogizes to Second Circuit precedent allowing fraud\u2011on\u2011the\u2011market to be invoked by investors who transact off\u2011market at prices tied to the market.",
          "Regarding loss causation, Monk argues his economic loss was the difference between the $7.10 cash\u2011out price and the higher per\u2011ADS amount he would have received had he exercised appraisal rights and obtained a judicial 'fair value' determination akin to what the Dissenters received in the Cayman Appraisal Action. He asserts that the Proxies concealed the true value of Shanda and the severity of the undervaluation embedded in the merger price, foreseeably causing minority shareholders to forgo their appraisal rights. He distinguishes this 'lost appraisal remedy' theory from disallowed claims seeking the 'intrinsic fair value' of shares irrespective of state appraisal mechanisms, and relies on Wilson v. Great American Industries to argue that forfeiture of appraisal rights due to misleading proxies is a cognizable form of loss causation.",
          "On the omission\u2011duty issue, he further argues that even if Cayman law is not entirely settled, federal courts can recognize a disclosure duty where directors in a controlled, going\u2011private transaction voluntarily choose to issue proxy materials and solicit shareholder action, including a decision whether to dissent. Once they speak, he contends, they have a duty under federal law not to mislead and to correct or update projections that have been rendered materially inaccurate by subsequent events like MIIM\u2019s unexpectedly strong performance.",
          "On the Section 20(a) control\u2011person claims, Monk contends that because he has adequately alleged a primary Section 10(b) violation by Shanda, the allegations that individual defendants were high\u2011level officers and directors who controlled the content of the Proxies and approval of the merger, and were culpable participants in the dissemination of the alleged misstatements, are sufficient to plead control\u2011person liability.",
          "With respect to leave to amend, Monk argues that denial of his request to add Altimeo Asset Management as a named plaintiff was error because Rule 15(a) requires courts to freely grant leave to amend absent a valid reason, and the district court gave none. He asserts that Altimeo, as a 'Seller' who transacted in the ADS on the market during the relevant period, would add a distinct and potentially stronger set of reliance and damages theories to the case, and that there was no undue delay, bad faith, prejudice, or futility shown."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "Defendants argue that Section 10(b) does not reach Monk\u2019s claims because, while the ADS were listed on NASDAQ, the relevant 'purchase or sale' for Section 10(b) purposes was the forced tender into a foreign\u2011law freeze\u2011out merger consummated in the Cayman Islands or China. They contend that City of Pontiac clarified that the key question under Morrison is where the transaction occurred, not merely where the securities were listed, and that the merger transaction here was not domestic. In their view, Monk\u2019s reliance on listing status alone impermissibly broadens Section 10(b)\u2019s extraterritorial reach.",
          "On the misrepresentation allegations concerning projections preparation, defendants contend that the statements about projecting revenues 'for each new game' and that the projections were 'reasonably prepared' based on 'best available estimates' and 'good faith judgments' are non\u2011actionable opinions and\/or are literally true. They point to the complaint\u2019s own admission that management projected revenues by grouping games into categories and estimating revenues for each category, arguing that using such a 'simplistic' methodology does not equate to fraud. They assert that a reasonable investor would not interpret the Proxies as promising a particular 'game\u2011specific' analytical technique and that differences in financial modeling approaches do not make opinion statements about reasonableness or good faith materially misleading.",
          "Regarding amortization and depreciation, defendants contend that alleged flaws in the internal projection methodology do not transform the accompanying statements into actionable misrepresentations. They rely on cases like OFI Asset Management v. Cooper Tire, arguing that as long as the projections disclosed in the Proxies accurately reflected the numbers actually provided to Merrill Lynch, any dispute about the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions or accounting methods falls outside Section 10(b). They maintain that investors were adequately cautioned about the forward\u2011looking and uncertain nature of the projections.",
          "Defendants argue that the projections themselves, including the MIIM lifetime revenue estimate, fall within the PSLRA safe harbor for forward\u2011looking statements because they were explicitly identified as projections and accompanied by risk disclosures and cautionary language. They assert that plaintiffs seek to impose liability based on hindsight (MIIM\u2019s subsequent success) rather than contemporaneous knowledge and that the complaint does not adequately allege that, at the time of the March 2015 Projections, management actually disbelieved the MIIM estimates. They contend that optimism about MIIM\u2019s prospects and Mir II\u2019s history does not show that a lower forecast was insincere. They also argue that the safe harbor, or at least the 'bespeaks caution' doctrine, should protect these statements.",
          "On the 'summary' characterization, defendants maintain that describing the March 2015 Projections in the Proxies as a 'summary' of the financial projections is accurate and not misleading, even though the 2020 data provided to Merrill Lynch was omitted. They argue that a summary, by definition, need not contain all information considered by the advisor and may reasonably exclude data deemed less significant. They further contend that the 2020 projections showed a deceleration in growth and therefore were not meaningfully positive; any omission was immaterial as a matter of law and could not have significantly altered the total mix of information for a reasonable investor.",
          "Regarding fairness opinions, defendants argue that statements that the merger price and transaction were 'fair' and in shareholders\u2019 best interests are classic, non\u2011actionable opinions or corporate puffery. They emphasize that Monk has not plausibly alleged that the Special Committee or board disbelieved the fairness of the $7.10 price at the time the Proxies were issued. They contend that plaintiffs improperly seek to bootstrap disagreements over valuations and projections into securities fraud and that, particularly in a going\u2011private context, fairness determinations inherently involve judgment and are not objectively verifiable. They argue there are no well\u2011pleaded facts showing that directors did not conduct a meaningful inquiry or that they adopted a fairness opinion they knew to be baseless.",
          "On omissions, defendants argue that Cayman law does not impose on directors a general duty to disclose all material information to shareholders and that the 'sufficient information' duty discussed in Sharp v. Blank and similar cases is limited to ensuring shareholders receive enough information to understand the purpose of a meeting or transaction, not to supplying full valuation data or post\u2011projection performance metrics. They emphasize that under Sharp, directors do not by virtue of their position owe shareholders a fiduciary duty to disclose material facts before entering into transactions and that therefore no state\u2011law (Cayman) duty exists to disclose MIIM\u2019s specific revenue performance. They argue that without such a duty, there can be no actionable omission under Section 10(b) based solely on failure to update or correct projections.",
          "On scienter, defendants contend that the complaint fails to allege a strong inference of intent to defraud. They argue that the alleged motive\u2014obtaining or supporting a lower merger price\u2014is not sufficient because a desire to secure a favorable transaction price is common to most buyers and sellers in M&A transactions and does not rise above generalized corporate motives. They also assert that Zhang and Liang\u2019s alleged dual roles as insiders and members of the buyer group do not show that they intended to harm Shanda or its shareholders, and that normal negotiating behavior and board\u2011level judgments about value are not evidence of fraud. They further invoke the 'adverse interest' exception, arguing that if Zhang and Liang acted primarily for their own benefit or Ningxia\u2019s benefit, in opposition to Shanda\u2019s interests, their scienter cannot be imputed to the company.",
          "On reliance, defendants argue that the fraud\u2011on\u2011the\u2011market presumption does not apply in the context of a forced tender in a freeze\u2011out merger when the only actual transaction is the cancellation of shares at a privately negotiated merger price, not at a market\u2011determined price. They contend that after announcement of the merger, the market price of Shanda\u2019s ADS was effectively 'constrained' or 'capped' by the $7.10 merger price, which had been negotiated before the alleged misstatements were disseminated, so there was no efficient, fully informative market in which misrepresentations could affect price. They emphasize that Monk did not allege that he read or directly relied on the Proxies, did not buy or sell on the market during the class period, and did nothing affirmative (such as voting for the merger) that could show reliance. They also cite Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedents (Blue Chip Stamps, Virginia Bankshares, Grace v. Rosenstock) warning against speculative reliance theories by hypothetical or passive investors and argue that extending Basic\u2019s presumption to a non\u2011transactional decision to 'do nothing' and forgo appraisal is impermissible.",
          "On loss causation, defendants argue that Monk\u2019s alleged loss is not causally linked to the misstatements because (1) the $7.10 merger price was locked in via negotiations and was not alleged to have been affected by public misstatements; (2) the merger would have taken place at the same price regardless of any minority shareholder action, as Buyer Group 4 already had enough votes; and (3) Monk\u2019s theory that he would have pursued appraisal and recovered more is speculative and akin to the disfavored 'hypothetical transaction' claims barred by Blue Chip Stamps and Virginia Bankshares. They maintain that Monk\u2019s claimed injury is essentially that he did not obtain the same appraisal outcome as the Dissenters, but that Section 10(b) does not guarantee a 'fair' or 'intrinsic' value and cannot be used to backdoor corporate\u2011law appraisal remedies. They distinguish Wilson as involving shareholders who actually voted in favor of a merger and say Grace rejected similar 'lost appraisal' theories where shareholders did not show such affirmative reliance.",
          "With respect to the Section 20(a) claims, defendants argue that if there is no adequately pleaded primary violation by Shanda under Section 10(b), the control\u2011person claims necessarily fail. They also contest allegations of 'culpable participation,' asserting that the individual defendants acted in good faith reliance on advisors and that plaintiffs have not alleged particularized facts about each defendant\u2019s role in any fraud.",
          "Finally, concerning leave to amend, defendants contend that the district court acted within its discretion in denying the request to add Altimeo as a named plaintiff, given the late stage of the litigation, the court\u2019s prior guidance, and potential futility or complications arising from adding a new plaintiff with a different transactional posture ('Seller' versus 'Tenderer'). They argue that Rule 15 does not require courts to explain such denials in detail and that any error was harmless in view of their position that the underlying claims fail as a matter of law."

That is enough to plead that the opinions either lacked a reasonable basis or omitted facts that a reasonable investor would view as conflicting with the stated basis.

Those allegations suffice under Omnicare\/Tongue to plead an actionable opinion. The PSLRA safe harbor cannot apply because forward\u2011looking statements \u2018made in connection with\u2019 a going\u2011private transaction subject to Rule 13e\u20113 are carved out, and the bespeaks\u2011caution doctrine cannot defeat well\u2011pleaded allegations that the core assumption (MIIM revenues) had already been overtaken by events.

But federal law independently imposes a duty not to make half\u2011truths: once the company chose to speak via Proxies about projections and MIIM\u2019s prospects, it had to avoid materially misleading omissions. On that narrower theory\u2014failure to update\/qualify projections once MIIM\u2019s actual revenues dwarfed the forecast\u2014the omission is actionable regardless of Cayman law. Thus, the appellate court will likely agree there is no broad stand\u2011alone Cayman\u2011law duty, but reverse to the extent the district court used the absence of such a duty to foreclose any omissions claim tied to the existing statements. Hence a mixed outcome: no new Cayman\u2011law duty, but recognition that the same facts can support a \u00a710(b) omission claim as a corrective to misleading projections and fairness statements."

That motive is more specific than generic incentives to increase stock price and aligns with Second Circuit authority treating self\u2011dealing insiders in going\u2011private deals as having a strong motive. Coupled with detailed allegations that they oversaw and supplied the challenged projections, knew or had access to real\u2011time MIIM data, and still endorsed the Proxies, the circumstantial evidence of at least recklessness is strong. Imputation to Shanda is also likely: the \u2018adverse interest\u2019 exception is narrow and generally does not apply where the transaction (paying a lower price) can benefit the corporation as an enterprise, even if certain agents also benefit personally. Taken holistically, these allegations yield a scienter inference at least as compelling as any benign explanation.

The better reading of Basic and Second Circuit cases is that the presumption may apply beyond pure exchange trades where the plaintiff\u2019s decision is tied to the market price.

The fact that the merger price effectively \u2018capped\u2019 trading does not mean price was unaffected by the Proxies; the complaint plausibly alleges that truthful disclosures would have raised market price and attracted appraisal\u2011arbitrage buyers, changing his incentives.

Monk alleges the Proxies concealed that $7.10 was materially below fair value, thereby foreseeably inducing him not to dissent, and that Dissenters in fact obtained a materially higher award in the Cayman appraisal action. This ties the alleged misstatements directly to both the decision to forgo appraisal (transaction causation) and the economic shortfall (loss causation). The merger\u2019s inevitability due to majority control does not defeat a Wilson\u2011style theory focused on the state\u2011law remedy he allegedly relinquished.

The ADS were clearly U.S.\u2011listed, fitting Morrison\u2019s first prong, so extraterritoriality will not bar the case. On the merits, the allegations about flawed methodology, extreme pessimism in MIIM projections contradicted by contemporaneous data, omission of 2020 projections, and continued endorsement of fairness opinions despite contrary information present a strong Omnicare\u2011style claim that several opinions and related statements were materially misleading. The panel will likely hold these misstatements and half\u2011truth omissions actionable. Scienter is supported by specific self\u2011dealing motives of Zhang and Liang as buyers in a going\u2011private transaction and by their access to real\u2011time MIIM data, offering a cogent inference of at least recklessness that is imputable to Shanda. \n\nAs to reliance and loss causation, the district court\u2019s main dismissal ground (loss causation) is vulnerable: Wilson v. Great American Industries supports Monk\u2019s \u2018lost appraisal remedy\u2019 theory where misleading proxy disclosures lead shareholders to forgo appraisal and accept an unfair cash\u2011out price. The Cayman appraisal action\u2019s higher award to Dissenters provides a concrete benchmark for the alleged economic harm. The appellate court is therefore likely to hold loss causation adequately pleaded, and\u2014given its acceptance of market efficiency\u2014to allow reliance to be established through fraud\u2011on\u2011the\u2011market or, alternatively, through the well\u2011recognized proxy\u2011induced\u2011forfeiture theory used in Wilson\u2011type cases.\n\nFinally, the unexplained denial of leave to add Altimeo as a named plaintiff disserves Rule 15\u2019s liberal standard and, under Second Circuit practice, is likely to be deemed an abuse of discretion. Taken together, these points suggest a predominantly plaintiff\u2011favorable outcome: reversal of the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on key \u00a710(b)\/Rule 10b\u20115 and \u00a720(a) claims and reversal of the denial of leave to amend to add Altimeo. The result is a substantial overall reversal, with only a limited affirmance on the narrow point that Cayman law does not, by itself, create a broader, free\u2011standing duty to disclose MIIM revenues apart from federal half\u2011truth principles."

      "factual_background":"In 2019, the State of New Hampshire, acting on behalf of its residents, filed two separate lawsuits in New Hampshire state court against 3M Company and other chemical companies that produced synthetic chemical substances referred to as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). New Hampshire alleged that the defendants designed defective PFAS products, negligently marketed and supplied those products to New Hampshire users, and concealed critical information about PFAS toxicity from users and regulators. According to New Hampshire, these acts resulted in widespread PFAS contamination of the state's natural resources, including water, soil, vegetation, and wildlife.\n\nThe two lawsuits were structured to separate PFAS contamination sources. One lawsuit (the \"AFFF Suit\") sought damages only for PFAS contamination arising from aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) products. The complaint in that suit expressly disclaimed any recovery for PFAS-containing non-AFFF products. The second lawsuit (the \"Non-AFFF Suit\"), which is the subject of this appeal, sought damages solely for contamination attributable to PFAS-containing non-AFFF products and explicitly disclaimed any recovery for AFFF-related PFAS.\n\nNew Hampshire alleges that non-AFFF PFAS contamination is pervasive and statewide, affecting natural resources throughout New Hampshire. At the same time, in related litigation (the AFFF Suit), New Hampshire has alleged that AFFF, including MilSpec AFFF manufactured by 3M under direction and specification of the U.S. military for use at locations such as Pease Air Force Base in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, contaminated some of the same broad class of state natural resources. MilSpec AFFF refers to AFFF made to military specifications overseen by Navy officials responsible for approving changes to the military specification. 3M\u2019s independent investigation led it to believe that PFAS from MilSpec AFFF used at Pease Air Force Base plausibly commingled with PFAS contamination from non-AFFF sources in nearby water bodies, including the Great Bay Estuary.\n\nNew Hampshire, in describing this Non-AFFF Suit in a November 2019 state-court memorandum, characterized it as a case for \"statewide contamination\" not geographically limited but pervasive across the state's natural resources. New Hampshire also informed 3M in that filing that it had brought a separate AFFF-related lawsuit, involving some of the same defendants, exclusively concerning contamination from AFFF, and that this separate AFFF case had been removed to federal court and transferred to multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the District of South Carolina. In February 2020, New Hampshire filed in this Non-AFFF case a transcript from a discovery status hearing in the South Carolina MDL, in which the parties and the MDL court discussed discovery concerning what 3M told the federal government and what the government knew about the dangers of MilSpec AFFF, and clarified that \"MilSpec\" refers to military specification AFFF whose formulation and changes are subject to approval by a Naval Sea Systems Command official.\n\nNew Hampshire later served initial disclosures in December 2021 in this Non-AFFF Suit listing over 200 sites alleged to be contaminated with non-AFFF PFAS. The State cautioned that some documents relating to those sites might reference connections to the use of AFFF but reiterated that in this Non-AFFF Suit it was not seeking recovery for any AFFF-related injury. 3M contends, however, that based on the statewide nature of the alleged non-AFFF PFAS contamination, its own investigation, and New Hampshire\u2019s filings, it became apparent that PFAS contamination at some of the natural resources at issue plausibly came from both MilSpec AFFF and non-AFFF sources, leading to commingling of MilSpec AFFF PFAS and non-AFFF PFAS in at least some locations.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In the two 2019 state-court lawsuits, New Hampshire asserted state-law claims against 3M and other defendants for harms allegedly caused by PFAS contamination of the state's natural resources. The complaints alleged that defendants designed defective PFAS products, negligently marketed those products to New Hampshire users, and concealed critical information about PFAS toxicity, resulting in contamination of water, soil, vegetation, and wildlife. The AFFF Suit sought damages only for PFAS from AFFF products and expressly disclaimed damages for PFAS from non-AFFF products. The Non-AFFF Suit at issue in this appeal sought damages only for injuries attributable to PFAS-containing non-AFFF products and expressly disclaimed recovery for AFFF PFAS. In the Non-AFFF Suit, the state initially also asserted trespass and public trust claims, which the state court later dismissed.",
        "district_court_decision":"3M removed the AFFF Suit to federal court in July 2019 under the federal officer removal statute, arguing that the AFFF at issue likely included AFFF that 3M manufactured under the direction of the U.S. military for Pease Air Force Base. New Hampshire did not contest that removal, and the AFFF Suit was transferred to the District of South Carolina for inclusion in an AFFF multidistrict litigation. The Non-AFFF Suit remained in New Hampshire state court. Over approximately three years, the state court dismissed New Hampshire\u2019s trespass and public trust claims in the Non-AFFF Suit. On August 25, 2021, New Hampshire filed a second amended complaint (the \"complaint\"), which remains the operative pleading. In December 2021, New Hampshire served initial disclosures listing more than 200 sites alleged to be contaminated with non-AFFF PFAS, while reiterating that it did not seek recovery for AFFF-related injury in this case.\n\nOn April 29, 2022, 3M filed a notice of removal for the Non-AFFF Suit, invoking the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1), and the later-received-paper provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b)(3). 3M relied in part on its own investigation, which suggested that MilSpec AFFF PFAS it manufactured under federal direction for Pease Air Force Base plausibly commingled with non-AFFF PFAS contamination in nearby water bodies, such as the Great Bay Estuary, and that New Hampshire\u2019s allegations of statewide non-AFFF PFAS contamination encompassed areas including Pease.\n\nNew Hampshire moved to remand the Non-AFFF Suit to state court. On March 29, 2023, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire granted New Hampshire\u2019s motion to remand. The district court concluded, on two independent grounds, that (1) removal of the Non-AFFF Suit did not satisfy the requirements of the federal officer removal statute, and (2) even assuming those requirements were satisfied, 3M\u2019s removal was untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b)(3). On April 13, 3M filed a timely notice of appeal from that remand order. On April 14, New Hampshire requested that the district court execute the remand. The district court agreed but delayed the formal remand to allow 3M an opportunity to seek a stay pending appeal. 3M did not request a stay, and the case was formally remanded to state court on May 2, 2023.\n\nWhile the appeal was pending, and before merits briefing, New Hampshire moved in the court of appeals for summary disposition, arguing that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the remand order, particularly in light of the fact that the case had already been remanded to state court and no stay had been obtained. The appellate court denied that motion without prejudice, and New Hampshire reasserted its jurisdictional arguments in its appellate brief.",

          "3M argues that the appellate court has jurisdiction to review the remand order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) because this case involves the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1), which is expressly exempted from \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s general bar on review of remand orders. 3M maintains that the fact the district court executed the remand and that 3M did not seek a stay does not strip the appellate court of jurisdiction or provide a 'formal procedural mechanism' barrier to retrieving the case, particularly in light of precedent recognizing the reviewability of such remand orders.",
          "3M contends it did not waive its right to a federal forum or to appeal by failing to seek a stay, because waiver requires clear and unequivocal conduct indicating an intent to relinquish the right to removal, and there is no such conduct here. 3M notes that it timely filed a notice of appeal and has consistently maintained its entitlement to a federal forum under the federal officer removal statute.",
          "On the merits of removal, 3M asserts that the Non-AFFF Suit 'relates to' its federal-direction conduct in manufacturing MilSpec AFFF for the U.S. military. 3M\u2019s theory is that the statewide non-AFFF PFAS contamination alleged by New Hampshire includes areas around Pease Air Force Base and other locations where MilSpec AFFF was used, and that PFAS from MilSpec AFFF has plausibly commingled with non-AFFF PFAS in at least some of the natural resources at issue (e.g., Great Bay Estuary). According to 3M, because the claims concern 'statewide contamination' of natural resources that includes such areas, a court adjudicating the Non-AFFF Suit will necessarily have to determine whether, and to what extent, MilSpec AFFF PFAS contributed to the contamination. Thus, the case is 'for or relating to' 3M\u2019s acts under color of federal office, satisfying the nexus requirement of \u00a7 1442(a)(1).",
          "Concerning timeliness, 3M argues that no 'other paper' provided by New Hampshire before March 30, 2022 made removability under the federal officer removal statute sufficiently clear to start the 30-day clock. 3M maintains that New Hampshire\u2019s operative complaint in the Non-AFFF Suit did not on its face assert claims involving AFFF or MilSpec AFFF and, indeed, expressly disclaimed AFFF-related relief; thus, the complaint did not reveal any nexus between the case and 3M\u2019s federal-direction conduct. 3M further argues that the December 2021 initial disclosures, while identifying numerous allegedly contaminated sites, expressly reiterated that New Hampshire was not seeking damages for AFFF-related contamination and did not specify that any site\u2019s contamination plausibly came from both MilSpec AFFF and non-AFFF PFAS sources. Therefore, in 3M\u2019s view, those disclosures did not provide specific and unambiguous notice that the case was removable on a federal officer theory.",
          "3M also contends that documents originating in the separate AFFF Suit, such as the AFFF complaint or 3M\u2019s own notice of removal in that suit, cannot qualify as 'other paper' under \u00a7 1446(b)(3) in this Non-AFFF Suit because those documents were not filed by New Hampshire in this case and were created in a different proceeding. 3M emphasizes that \u00a7 1446(b)(3) and governing case law generally require the triggering paper to come from the plaintiff in the very case being removed.",
          "3M disputes that New Hampshire\u2019s November 2019 omnibus opposition memorandum or the February 2020 MDL status hearing transcript filed as an exhibit in this case provided clear notice of removability. It argues that the memorandum only reiterated the separation between the Non-AFFF and AFFF Suits and did not state that any particular natural resource at issue in this case was contaminated by both MilSpec AFFF PFAS and non-AFFF PFAS. As to the MDL transcript, 3M maintains that it primarily concerned discovery in the AFFF MDL and did not link MilSpec AFFF contamination to the specific natural resources that New Hampshire is suing over in the Non-AFFF Suit. According to 3M, the removal clock could not start until New Hampshire identified particular sites or evidence indicating that the non-AFFF claims actually encompassed contamination partly caused by MilSpec AFFF.",
          "3M further points to a June 2022 statement by New Hampshire, made in opposing consolidation of the Non-AFFF Suit into the AFFF MDL, in which the State allegedly asserted that the two suits do not involve overlapping sites. 3M cites this statement to argue that, even after it removed the Non-AFFF Suit, there remained ambiguity about any overlap between MilSpec AFFF PFAS and non-AFFF PFAS contamination, suggesting that earlier filings could not have clearly triggered the 30-day removal period."

New Hampshire contends that once the case was remanded and jurisdiction revested in the state court, there was no longer a 'formal procedural mechanism' by which the federal courts could effectively retrieve the case, and that principles reflected in decisions like Forty Six Hundred LLC v. Cadence Education, LLC support the view that federal power ends once remand is accomplished.",
          "In the alternative, New Hampshire asserts that 3M waived its right to appeal the remand order or to request that the district court retrieve the case by failing to seek a stay before the remand was executed. New Hampshire maintains that 3M\u2019s inaction in the district court, despite being afforded an opportunity to request a stay, demonstrates a relinquishment or forfeiture of its right to pursue review of the remand order.",
          "On the federal officer removal issue, New Hampshire emphasizes that in the Non-AFFF Suit it has consistently and explicitly disclaimed any claim for relief related to AFFF or AFFF PFAS, and that the case is limited to contamination caused by non-AFFF PFAS products. New Hampshire argues that the mere possibility that evidence concerning AFFF or MilSpec AFFF might be introduced as a defense or alternative causation theory does not convert a non-AFFF case into one 'for or relating to' acts under color of federal office within the meaning of \u00a7 1442(a)(1).",
          "New Hampshire further contends that its decision to file separate lawsuits\u2014one targeting AFFF-related contamination and one targeting non-AFFF contamination\u2014reflects its intent to segregate claims so that the Non-AFFF Suit would not be based on federal-direction conduct. It notes that in its December 2021 disclosures in this case, it expressly warned that some documents regarding the listed sites might reference AFFF but reiterated that it was not seeking recovery for any AFFF-related injury or contamination in this action.",
          "Regarding timeliness, New Hampshire argues that multiple filings it made in this Non-AFFF Suit triggered the 30-day removal clock long before 3M removed the case in April 2022. New Hampshire points to: (a) its November 21, 2019 memorandum in support of an omnibus objection to motions to dismiss, in which it characterized this lawsuit as one for 'statewide contamination' that is 'pervasive across the natural resources of the State' and explained that it had filed a separate AFFF lawsuit involving the same core defendants; and (b) the February 21, 2020 filing of an MDL status hearing transcript from the South Carolina AFFF MDL, which described MilSpec AFFF, its military specifications, and the federal government\u2019s role and knowledge regarding AFFF. New Hampshire maintains that, taken together with the allegations of widespread and statewide contamination in the complaint, these documents provided 3M with specific and unambiguous notice that the case was removable under a federal officer theory under 3M\u2019s own commingling rationale.",
          "New Hampshire also relies on its December 2021 initial disclosures, which identified more than 200 sites allegedly contaminated with non-AFFF PFAS and acknowledged that some documents related to those sites might reference AFFF. New Hampshire argues that, given 3M\u2019s knowledge of AFFF usage at places like Pease Air Force Base and its own investigation into potential commingling, these disclosures reinforced what was already apparent from earlier filings: that at least some of the natural resources for which New Hampshire seeks recovery in this statewide non-AFFF case may also have been impacted by AFFF, including MilSpec AFFF for which 3M claims federal officer protection. Under Romulus and related precedent, New Hampshire contends that 3M was required to act within 30 days of being able to 'easily determine' removability based on the combination of these plaintiff-provided documents and its own reasonable assessment of their implications.",
          "New Hampshire disputes 3M\u2019s assertion that it needed to identify a specific, named site with proven cross-contamination of MilSpec AFFF PFAS and non-AFFF PFAS before the 30-day clock could start. Instead, New Hampshire maintains that the rule is whether the plaintiff\u2019s papers provided sufficient information, viewed reasonably and in context, to inform the defendant that federal officer jurisdiction was available under its asserted theory. Once New Hampshire made clear that it alleged pervasive statewide non-AFFF PFAS contamination and that MilSpec AFFF made by 3M had contaminated New Hampshire\u2019s natural resources (as reflected in the related AFFF litigation and MDL materials filed as exhibits), New Hampshire asserts that 3M had enough information to ascertain removability but waited well beyond the statutory 30-day period before filing its notice of removal."

The complaint and subsequent filings in this case maintain that segregation; the mere prospect that AFFF (including MilSpec AFFF) might be mentioned in evidence or as an alternative cause does not transform a non\u2011AFFF\u2011only damages claim into one \u2018for or relating to\u2019 3M\u2019s federal\u2011direction conduct. 3M\u2019s theory rests on its own inference that some natural resources may have commingled AFFF and non\u2011AFFF PFAS, but that inference is not how the State has framed its claims or recovery.

In February 2020, the State filed in this Non\u2011AFFF docket an MDL transcript detailing MilSpec AFFF, military specifications, and the federal government\u2019s role and knowledge\u2014squarely tying MilSpec AFFF contamination of New Hampshire resources to 3M\u2019s federal\u2011direction conduct. Taken together with the complaint\u2019s statewide\u2011contamination allegations and 3M\u2019s own knowledge of AFFF use at Pease, those plaintiff\u2011provided filings gave 3M everything it needed\u2014under its own commingling theory\u2014to \u2018easily determine\u2019 that a federal officer nexus could be asserted. At the latest, the December 2021 initial disclosures, listing more than 200 sites and acknowledging documents referencing AFFF, reinforced this.

On the core removal question, New Hampshire has meticulously cabined this Non\u2011AFFF Suit to non\u2011AFFF PFAS contamination and has disclaimed any AFFF\u2011based recovery. Courts generally construe \u00a7 1442\u2019s \u2018for or relating to\u2019 language broadly but still require that the plaintiff\u2019s claims themselves arise from, or be directed at, federal\u2011direction conduct, not merely that federal\u2011direction conduct might be mentioned as background or an alternative cause. 3M\u2019s nexus theory depends on potential evidentiary overlap and its own investigation into commingling, not on how the State has defined the claims and the relief sought. That is a weak basis for federal officer jurisdiction and aligns with district\u2011 and appellate\u2011level PFAS decisions rejecting similar attempts to remove purely non\u2011AFFF claims.\n\nEven if some panel member viewed the nexus question as closer, the independent timeliness ground strongly supports affirmance. Under Romulus, the \u2018other paper\u2019 need only allow a reasonable defendant to ascertain removability, and the combination of the statewide\u2011contamination allegations, the November 2019 memorandum explicitly juxtaposing this Non\u2011AFFF Suit with the AFFF litigation, the MDL transcript filed in this case explaining MilSpec AFFF and federal involvement, and the 2021 site disclosures together gave 3M more than enough information\u2014well before April 2022\u2014to assert the very commingling\u2011based federal officer theory it now presses. Because the district court\u2019s order rests on two independently sufficient grounds, and both withstand de novo review, the appellate court is most likely to affirm the remand in full."

In each underlying matter, a parent of a child with a disability pursued administrative proceedings against the New York City Department of Education to enforce the child\u2019s rights under the IDEA. The students are all children with disabilities entitled to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under the statute. The parents, represented by the Cuddy Law Firm (CLF), pursued due process complaints or other administrative remedies alleging that NYCDOE failed to provide appropriate educational services or placements as required by the IDEA.\n\nIn each case relevant to these appeals, the parents were successful in the administrative proceedings and were deemed prevailing parties under the IDEA. Having prevailed, the parents, through CLF, then sought to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and costs from NYCDOE under the IDEA\u2019s fee\u2011shifting provision, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I), which allows reasonable fees to be awarded to parents who prevail in actions or proceedings under the Act.\n\nAfter the administrative victories, CLF and NYCDOE attempted to negotiate resolutions of the parents\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fee claims but were unable to reach agreement on the amounts to be paid. The disputes centered on the hourly rates to be applied to CLF attorneys and staff, the number of hours reasonably expended on the administrative and related federal litigation, and the overall reasonableness of the requested fee awards.

They sought compensation for work performed by the Cuddy Law Firm in the underlying IDEA administrative cases and, in many instances, for work in litigating the subsequent fee actions themselves (often referred to as 'fees on fees').

NYCDOE, No. 23\u2011764\u2011cv on cross\u2011appeal), NYCDOE also filed a cross\u2011appeal challenging aspects of the district court\u2019s fee determinations.",

They contest the reasonableness of the hourly rates set for CLF attorneys and staff, the various reductions and percentage cuts applied to the claimed hours, and the overall amounts awarded as attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In N.G.B. v. NYCDOE, NYCDOE filed a cross\u2011appeal challenging the district court\u2019s fee award in that particular case, although NYCDOE abandoned or moved to withdraw some of its other appeals (e.g., in Y.G. and Y.S. as noted in footnote 1).

As part of their arrangements with restaurants, defendants require restaurants to agree that they will not offer lower prices for the same meals through channels other than defendants\u2019 platforms (i.e., \"off-platform,\" such as direct sales by phone, in-person, or on non-defendant platforms). These provisions are described as no-price competition clauses (\"NPCCs\").\n\nPlaintiffs allege that defendants\u2019 use of NPCCs unlawfully fixes or inflates restaurant meal prices by preventing restaurants from offering lower prices off-platform. According to plaintiffs, this conduct has caused restaurant customers to pay artificially high prices not only when ordering through defendants\u2019 own platforms, but also when purchasing from the same restaurants through other means. The putative class action is brought on behalf of three categories of restaurant customers: (1) customers who purchased takeout or delivery items directly from restaurants that were subject to a defendant\u2019s NPCC; (2) customers who purchased dine\u2011in meals from restaurants subject to a defendant\u2019s NPCC; and (3) customers who purchased meals through a non\u2011defendant\u2019s platform (such as another delivery service) from restaurants that were subject to a defendant\u2019s NPCC.\n\nPlaintiffs seek injunctive relief and damages based on both direct purchases from restaurants bound by NPCCs made using defendants\u2019 platforms and indirect purchases made from NPCC\u2011bound restaurants through non\u2011defendant platforms or channels.

          "Plaintiffs also stress that many class members (including some named plaintiffs) allegedly have viable antitrust claims despite never having used any defendant\u2019s platform or agreed to any Terms of Use, illustrating that the claims are not dependent on platform usage or on any customer\u2011platform contract. They argue that the presence or absence of platform usage is essentially coincidental for purposes of the alleged antitrust violations and therefore cannot provide the required nexus to bring the claims within the scope of the arbitration clauses or within the \"arising out of\" limitation in FAA \u00a7 2."

New York law on online contract formation, as applied by the Second Circuit, is demanding about clear, conspicuous notice and uncluttered presentation that puts a reasonably prudent user on inquiry notice. The district court found assent to Uber\u2019s and Postmates\u2019s Terms of Use but not to Grubhub\u2019s, indicating that Grubhub\u2019s interface was materially weaker on notice than the others. Plaintiffs analogized Grubhub\u2019s design to cluttered or confusing interfaces previously rejected, and the order\u2019s split result (Uber\/Postmates yes, Grubhub no) suggests the court carefully parsed the screen layout and did not rest on a general hostility to arbitration. On appeal, defendants largely reargue that Grubhub\u2019s notice was clear enough, but on these facts the Second Circuit is likely to follow its prior online-contract precedents and defer to the careful differentiation drawn by the district court. It will probably hold that the Grubhub interface did not provide adequate inquiry notice, so no valid arbitration agreement was formed with Grubhub."

Uber and Postmates point to delegation provisions that clearly and unmistakably assign questions of scope, validity, and enforceability of the arbitration agreement to the arbitrator. Under Supreme Court precedent (e.g., Rent-A-Center) and Second Circuit case law, once such a delegation clause exists, a court must send gateway questions to the arbitrator unless the plaintiff specifically challenges the delegation clause itself with a developed argument as to why having the arbitrator decide arbitrability is invalid or unconscionable. Here, defendants emphasize that plaintiffs offered, at most, a brief footnote and generalized unconscionability arguments directed at arbitration as a whole, not the delegation clause in particular. That is the kind of undeveloped, undifferentiated challenge that the Supreme Court has repeatedly held insufficient. The district court nonetheless decided scope and enforceability for Uber and Postmates itself. The Second Circuit is likely to hold that, as to Uber and Postmates, the parties clearly delegated arbitrability and plaintiffs failed to mount a specific, targeted challenge to that delegation. Accordingly, the district court erred in retaining decisionmaking authority over arbitrability for Uber and Postmates, and those threshold issues must be referred to arbitration. As to Grubhub, because no contract was formed, there is no valid delegation clause to enforce, so the district court\u2019s decision that the court decides arbitrability effectively stands, but that follows from the absence of any agreement at all rather than from a correct allocation of authority under a delegation clause."

          "reasoning":"Scope is a question of contract interpretation and thus reviewed de novo. The district court concluded that the antitrust claims lack a sufficient nexus to the Terms of Use and therefore fall outside all three defendants\u2019 arbitration clauses. But the clauses (especially Grubhub\u2019s) are described as very broad, covering disputes arising out of the agreement, payments by or to the company, use of the platform and services, the customer\u2019s relationship with the company, or any other dispute with the company. Under FAA \u00a7 2 and Second Circuit precedent, antitrust and other statutory claims are arbitrable if they bear a meaningful relationship to the contractual relationship\u2014courts look to the factual allegations, not the legal labels. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory relies on defendants\u2019 accumulation and use of platform customers (and corresponding market power) to impose NPCCs on restaurants and thereby raise prices. For Platform Plaintiffs, their injury, as pleaded, is that when they used the platforms or bought from restaurants subject to platform-imposed NPCCs, they paid higher prices. That is at least plausibly, and likely directly, related to their use of the platforms and their ongoing relationships with defendants. The fact that other consumers who never used the platforms may have similar antitrust claims does not sever the nexus for those who did use the platforms and agreed to broad arbitration clauses. Given the strong federal presumption in favor of arbitrability where there is any plausible connection to the contractual relationship, the Second Circuit is likely to reject the district court\u2019s narrow \u201cno nexus\u201d view and hold that, for Platform Plaintiffs bound by valid arbitration agreements, their antitrust claims fall within the scope of those clauses. For Uber and Postmates, however, the appellate court will likely say that the question of scope should be decided by the arbitrator under the delegation provisions; to that extent, it will reverse the district court\u2019s contrary ruling. For Grubhub, the court is likely to conclude that, if there had been a valid clause, these claims would be within its broad terms, so the district court\u2019s scope ruling as to Grubhub is incorrect as a matter of law, even though Grubhub ultimately cannot compel arbitration because of the contract-formation defect resolved in Issue 1."

      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",
      "confidence":0.68,
      "reasoning":"The appeal presents three separable questions: formation (existence of an agreement), who decides arbitrability, and scope. Formation is evaluated interface by interface under New York online-contract precedents. The district court carefully distinguished Uber\/Postmates (assent found) from Grubhub (no assent), mirroring the type of analysis the Second Circuit has previously endorsed. With only modest contrary indications in the record and no clear claim that Grubhub\u2019s interface was markedly better than past designs found insufficient, it is most likely the Second Circuit will affirm the finding that no valid arbitration agreement exists between Platform Plaintiffs and Grubhub. \n\nOn delegation, however, Supreme Court and Second Circuit cases strongly favor enforcing clearly worded delegation clauses absent a specific, targeted challenge. Defendants say Uber\u2019s and Postmates\u2019s Terms contain such clauses, and plaintiffs\u2019 supposed challenge is described as brief and generalized, framed largely as an attack on arbitration overall. That fits the pattern where appellate courts reverse district courts that insist on deciding arbitrability themselves despite a delegation provision. Thus, as to Uber and Postmates, the panel is likely to reverse and require that arbitrability (including scope and enforceability of the arbitration agreements) be decided by the arbitrator.\n\nFinally, on scope, the district court adopted an unusually narrow conception of the required nexus under FAA \u00a7 2. The factual theory of liability for Platform Plaintiffs is intertwined with their use of the platforms and their contractual relationships with defendants, and the arbitration clauses are drafted expansively. Existing precedent on broad \u201carising out of or relating to\u201d language and the strong presumption in favor of arbitrability where there is any non-frivolous connection makes it unlikely that the Second Circuit will endorse the district court\u2019s conclusion that these claims categorically fall outside the clauses. The more probable outcome is that, as a matter of law, such antitrust claims are within the scope of broad customer-platform arbitration agreements, at least for Platform Plaintiffs. For Uber and Postmates, however, the panel will hold that the scope determination must be made in the first instance by the arbitrator under the delegation clauses.\n\nPutting all of this together, the result is mixed: (1) the court affirms the district court\u2019s refusal to compel arbitration as to Grubhub because no valid agreement to arbitrate was formed; but (2) reverses the district court as to Uber and Postmates, holding that their delegation provisions must be enforced (so an arbitrator decides arbitrability) and that the district court\u2019s contrary reasoning on scope and nexus cannot stand. The case is therefore remanded with instructions to compel arbitration of the Platform Plaintiffs\u2019 disputes with Uber and Postmates (leaving non-platform users and Grubhub-side claims in court)."

      },
      "factual_background":"In July 2011, John Conti financed the purchase of a residential property in Rhode Island with a mortgage loan from Citizens Bank, N.A. Under the mortgage agreement, Conti was required to make advance payments of municipal property taxes and homeowner's insurance premiums into an escrow account maintained by Citizens. The purpose of this escrow account was to accumulate funds to pay periodic debts against the mortgaged property, such as taxes and insurance, providing the bank assurance that its collateral was protected and allowing Conti to avoid large lump-sum payments. Pursuant to the terms of the mortgage agreement, Citizens did not pay Conti any interest or earnings on the funds held in this escrow account.\n\nRhode Island General Laws \u00a7 19-9-2(a) requires mortgagees holding funds of a mortgagor in escrow for the payment of taxes and insurance on mortgaged property located in Rhode Island to pay or credit interest on those escrowed funds. The statute specifies that the required interest rate must be equal to the rate paid by the mortgagee on its regular savings accounts, if offered, and otherwise at a rate not less than the prevailing market rate of interest for regular savings accounts offered by local financial institutions.\n\nConti alleges that Citizens failed to pay interest on the escrow funds in accordance with this Rhode Island statute. He further alleges that Citizens engaged in this practice not only with respect to his own escrow account tied to Rhode Island property but also with respect to similarly situated customers across several states. The putative class definition in his complaint includes Citizens customers in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont who had mortgage-escrow accounts on which Citizens did not pay interest. In the alternative, he proposed a narrower class limited to Rhode Island-based customers.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In July 2021, Conti filed a putative class action against Citizens in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. He asserted two causes of action under state law: (1) breach of contract, alleging that the mortgage agreement, read in light of and incorporating Rhode Island law, obligated Citizens to pay interest on escrow funds as required by R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 19-9-2(a), and that Citizens' failure to do so breached the mortgage contract; and (2) unjust enrichment, pled in the alternative, alleging that Citizens was unjustly enriched by retaining the benefit of the escrow funds and any earnings thereon without paying interest to borrowers as required by the statute. The suit was brought on behalf of himself and a putative class, with an alternative, narrower Rhode Island-only class pleaded.",
        "district_court_decision":"Citizens moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the ground that the National Bank Act preempts the application of Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 19-9-2(a) to national banks, and therefore Conti's state-law claims based on that statute failed as a matter of law. The district court agreed with Citizens' preemption argument. It concluded that the National Bank Act preempts a state law wherever the law places limits on a federal banking power and determined that because the Rhode Island statute limited the power to establish and use escrow accounts, it significantly interfered with national banks' incidental powers to utilize such accounts. On that basis, the court held the Rhode Island interest-on-escrow statute preempted, dismissed Conti's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), and did so before addressing or deciding any issues of class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. As a result, the only plaintiff then before the court for purposes of judgment was Conti individually, and the only state statute directly at issue was R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 19-9-2(a). The district court did not reach Citizens' separate argument directed specifically at the unjust enrichment claim.",

He challenges the district court's conclusion that the National Bank Act preempts Rhode Island General Laws \u00a7 19-9-2(a) as applied to Citizens and, consequently, the dismissal of his breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Cantero v. Bank of America, N.A., a Second Circuit case involving a similar question of whether the National Bank Act preempted a New York law requiring payment of interest on mortgage-escrow accounts. The First Circuit stayed Conti's appeal pending the Supreme Court's decision in Cantero. After the Supreme Court issued its decision in Cantero, clarifying the legal standard for National Bank Act preemption of state consumer financial laws, the First Circuit lifted the stay, and the parties submitted post-Cantero briefing. On appeal, in addition to challenging the preemption ruling generally, there is also a related dispute about whether the unjust enrichment claim should be dismissed on grounds the district court did not reach."

          "Conti points out that there is no express conflict between the National Bank Act and the Rhode Island statute. The federal statutes granting banks the power to make real estate loans (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a)) and to employ incidental powers (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, Seventh) do not address, much less prohibit, paying interest on escrow accounts or reserve to banks the unfettered discretion to decide whether to pay such interest. Accordingly, this case is distinguishable from precedents like Barnett Bank and Fidelity where express conflicts existed.",
          "He emphasizes that interest-on-escrow statutes are not anomalous or inconsistent with the federal banking scheme. Multiple states (at least twelve) have enacted similar interest-on-escrow laws, and Congress, in amending the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639d), has required banks in certain specified mortgage contexts to comply with applicable state interest-on-escrow laws. While his particular mortgage is not covered by that TILA provision, he cites Congress's use of such laws as evidence that they are compatible with federal banking objectives, rather than in conflict with them.",
          "Conti asserts that Citizens has not provided concrete evidence or argument demonstrating that compliance with Rhode Island's requirement to pay escrow interest would materially impair its ability to make mortgage loans or operate escrow accounts, or otherwise significantly interfere with its exercise of federal powers.

It points to the existence of federal regulation of mortgage lending (including under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a) and implementing OCC regulations) and of escrow accounts under federal statutes such as RESPA, arguing that the omission of any interest requirement in these federal provisions reflects a decision to leave national banks free to decide whether to pay interest, without being compelled by state law.",

Wachovia Bank and First National Bank of San Jose expressing concern about state-by-state limitations and restrictions that could undermine the uniform operation of the national banking system.

Once that incorrect standard is set aside, Citizens must, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, plausibly show that Rhode Island\u2019s statute significantly interferes with its powers in a manner comparable to the preempted laws in Barnett, Franklin, Fidelity, or related cases. The summary indicates no express conflict with federal law, no indication that Congress or the OCC prohibited interest on escrow accounts, and strong evidence (other states\u2019 similar statutes and Congress\u2019s incorporation of them in TILA \u00a7 1639d) that such requirements are regarded as compatible with the federal scheme. Citizens\u2019 remaining arguments rely heavily on abstractions\u2014loss of flexibility, uniformity concerns, and regulatory silence\u2014that Dodd\u2013Frank and Cantero make insufficient by themselves to establish preemption. Under these circumstances, a court applying Cantero de novo is very likely to conclude that Citizens has not carried its burden at the pleadings stage and that preemption cannot be resolved against Conti as a matter of law. That necessitates reversal of the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal of both the contract and unjust enrichment claims and remand for further proceedings, including consideration of any non-preemption challenges to the unjust enrichment count. The result is a full reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment."

      "factual_background":"Plaintiffs John Does 1\u20137 are United States citizens who were victims of a 2016 Taliban attack in Afghanistan. They sued the Taliban, Al\u2011Qaeda, and the Haqqani Network in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in connection with that attack and obtained a default judgment in November 2020 in the amount of $138,418,741, jointly and severally, against those defendants based on their alleged involvement in the attack.\n\nProminvestbank (\"PIB\") is described as a bank located in Ukraine that, at the time its relevant account was blocked, was a \"Russian bank headquartered in Kyiv, Ukraine\" and a subsidiary of the Russian state\u2011owned bank Vnesheconombank (\"VEB\"). The plaintiffs alleged that PIB was an agency or instrumentality of the Taliban because Russia used VEB, and by extension PIB, to help the Taliban finance and fund some of its terrorist activities. \n\nThe specific asset at issue is a deposit account at The Bank of New York Mellon (\"BNYM\") in Oriskany, New York, holding over $40 million. In 2014, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") restricted this account pursuant to Executive Order 13662, which imposed certain sectoral sanctions on Russian entities. In 2021, OFAC further blocked PIB's assets pursuant to Executive Order 14024, an order issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\"IEEPA\"). Executive Order 14024 authorizes the blocking of property and interests in property of persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to have specified links to the Russian government or to play specified roles in the Russian economy. In February 2022, OFAC designated VEB as a Russian state\u2011owned institution that plays specific roles in supporting Russia's defense capability and economy, and simultaneously blocked the assets of 25 VEB subsidiaries, including PIB, thereby blocking any PIB assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in spring 2022, the Ukrainian government took steps to seize and nationalize PIB. According to the Deposit Guarantee Fund, Ukraine nationalized PIB through various governmental actions in May and September 2022. As a result, Ukraine, through its governmental mechanisms, assumed control and ownership of PIB, and VEB allegedly no longer had an ownership interest or control over PIB or its assets by the time plaintiffs moved for a writ of execution in September 2022. The district court, reviewing official Ukrainian government records, understood those records to reflect that by September 20, 2022 VEB had no control over or access to PIB's assets and that Ukrainian law no longer recognized VEB as having any ownership interest in PIB.\n\nSeparately, in April 2024 Congress enacted the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act (\"REPO Act\"), which, subject to certain exceptions, restricts the release or mobilization of Russian \"sovereign assets\" that are blocked or effectively immobilized as of the day before enactment, until specified presidential certifications occur. The parties disputed whether this statute affected plaintiffs' ability to execute their Texas default judgment against PIB's assets.\n\nIn September 2024, after the appeal was fully briefed and after this Court requested the views of the United States, the Treasury Department removed PIB from the list of entities blocked under Executive Order 14024. The Department of Justice informed the Court that Treasury had concluded it was no longer accurate to describe PIB as a VEB subsidiary, which had been the original basis for PIB\u2019s designation. As a result, PIB's assets, including those in the BNYM account at issue, were unblocked. On October 17, 2024, Treasury issued an Amended Unblocking Order clarifying that the unblocking covered all property and interests in property of PIB with respect to any civil proceeding commenced or pending under Section 201 of TRIA, regardless of when the proceeding was commenced or pending relative to the unblocking orders. On October 30, 2024, Treasury also removed PIB from the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) List, which had subjected PIB to Executive Order 13662\u2019s debt\u2011and\u2011equity restrictions.\n\nThese subsequent Executive Branch actions changed the status of the PIB account from a blocked asset under IEEPA\u2011based sanctions to an unblocked asset, and thus altered the statutory status of the BNYM account with respect to whether it could qualify as a \"blocked asset\" under TRIA.",

To enforce that judgment, plaintiffs initiated a new action in the Northern District of New York on September 20, 2022, by registering the Texas judgment and filing an ex parte emergency motion for a writ of execution or, alternatively, a writ of attachment. They invoked Section 201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (\"TRIA\"), seeking to execute their judgment against PIB's blocked assets in the BNYM account, on the theory that PIB was an agency or instrumentality of the Taliban. They also referenced 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(e) in connection with their requested relief. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim in the New York enforcement action was that, as holders of a judgment against terrorist parties, they were entitled under TRIA to attach and execute upon the blocked assets of an alleged agency or instrumentality of those terrorist parties.",

The magistrate judge found that (1) PIB qualified as an agency or instrumentality of the Taliban, (2) the relevant assets were held in the blocked account at BNYM, and (3) those blocked assets were subject to attachment under TRIA and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(e) to satisfy the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment.\n\nIn December 2022, the Deposit Guarantee Fund appeared and moved to intervene, seeking vacatur of the writ of execution. DGF argued, among other things, that Ukraine had seized and nationalized PIB prior to plaintiffs\u2019 September 20, 2022 application for the writ, so PIB was no longer an instrumentality of the Taliban even assuming it had once been. DGF also asserted that, due to this nationalization, VEB no longer had any control over or ownership interest in PIB or its assets at the relevant time. On July 12, 2023, Judge David N. Hurd granted DGF\u2019s motion to intervene and vacated the writ of execution. The district court\u2019s vacatur was based on its conclusion that, because of the Ukrainian government\u2019s nationalization of PIB following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, VEB had no control or ownership interest in PIB when plaintiffs sought the writ and, therefore, PIB could not be treated as an agency or instrumentality of the Taliban for purposes of TRIA attachment at that time.",

On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the vacatur of the writ and the underlying conclusion that Ukraine\u2019s nationalization of PIB rendered the writ invalid or ineffective under TRIA. During the pendency of the appeal, additional issues were raised in light of the REPO Act and Treasury\u2019s subsequent delisting and unblocking of PIB\u2019s assets, including whether the changed status of PIB\u2019s assets as unblocked affects plaintiffs\u2019 ability to obtain execution under TRIA in this case."

First, on the original ground the district court relied upon, the court acted within its discretion in vacating the writ after finding\u2014based on official Ukrainian documentation\u2014that PIB had been nationalized before plaintiffs sought execution, so that VEB no longer owned or controlled PIB and it could not be treated as an agency or instrumentality of the Taliban for TRIA purposes at the relevant time. Those factual findings are entitled to substantial deference, and the legal conclusion that plaintiffs failed to meet TRIA\u2019s agency-or-instrumentality requirement follows from them. Second, and more decisively after the developments on appeal, Treasury\u2019s delisting and unblocking of PIB, followed by an Amended Unblocking Order expressly extending to all property in any TRIA proceeding, remove the statutory predicate for relief: the asset is no longer a \u2018blocked asset\u2019 under TRIA \u00a7 201(d)(2)(A). Existing Second Circuit authority confirms that TRIA does not curtail the Executive\u2019s power to unblock assets under IEEPA or preserve judgment creditors\u2019 rights once assets are unblocked. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 587.402 is defeated by the regulation\u2019s own exception, which OFAC invoked in the Amended Unblocking Order.

Axon, through Cangrejeros de Santurce Baseball Club, LLC (Cangrejeros LLC), acquired operating control of one of the League\u2019s franchises, the Cangrejeros de Santurce (the Cangrejeros Franchise). Cangrejeros LLC had been formed in September 2019 to own and operate the team and conduct related business. On February 4, 2022, Axon became the sole member and chairman of Cangrejeros LLC, which continued to operate the franchise. The League\u2019s franchises compete not only on the field but also for fans, in\u2011person attendance, player talent, sponsorships, merchandise sales, and broadcast rights. Franchise investor\u2011operators do not share profits with each other.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that Axon invested heavily in the Cangrejeros Franchise, increasing player quality, improving fan experience, broadening the fan base, promoting and establishing new broadcasts (including expanding broadcasting reach to the continental United States), enhancing sponsorships, expanding merchandising, commissioning a documentary film about the team, offering higher player salaries, and proposing a preseason exhibition tournament.\n\nThe Cangrejeros Franchise plays its home games at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan under an Agreement for the Administration and Operation of the Franchise dated August 10, 2017. The stadium is owned and administered by the Municipality of San Juan. During the relevant period, the stadium allegedly suffered from serious disrepair, including a broken scoreboard, inadequate running water, broken toilets, and a failing roof. Miguel Romero Lugo was the Mayor of San Juan at the time.\n\nOn February 18, 2022, Axon\u2019s counsel sent Mayor Romero a letter on behalf of Cangrejeros LLC, responding to a leaked communication about the stadium\u2019s condition. The letter expressed a desire to rehabilitate the stadium as a monument to Puerto Rican sports culture and proposed that Cangrejeros LLC invest approximately $2 million in repairs in exchange for an exclusive fifteen\u2011year lease of the venue for the Cangrejeros Franchise. Mayor Romero publicly rejected this proposal in a press release.\n\nOn March 8, 2022, after Romero\u2019s press release, Cangrejeros LLC informed League president Juan A. Flores that, due to the Bithorn\u2019s conditions, it was considering relocating the Cangrejeros Franchise to another stadium in Puerto Rico and that an option had arisen to move the team to a stadium in better condition in the Municipality of Humacao. At a League Board meeting on February 22, 2022, Axon had already advised that he would no longer accept a municipal sponsorship from San Juan for the Bithorn, believing such sponsorship insufficient to guarantee needed improvements.\n\nOn March 10, 2022, Axon held a press conference reiterating publicly that he would not accept further municipal sponsorship from San Juan. He discussed the Bithorn\u2019s defects, their negative impact on player performance and fan engagement, San Juan\u2019s failure to correct the problems or provide adequate funds, and stated that San Juan\u2019s repeated failure to invest in the stadium and its unwillingness to collaborate with the franchise necessitated contemplating relocation to another municipality.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that Axon hoped this public pressure would spur the League to work with him either to compel San Juan to fulfill its obligations to improve the stadium or to allow relocation of the team. Instead, according to the complaint, Flores, acting in concert with Mayor Romero and with the agreement of the other investor\u2011operators, moved to force Axon to relinquish control over and his interest in the Cangrejeros Franchise.\n\nBy letter dated March 14, 2022, Flores informed Axon that he had engaged in conduct \"detrimental to baseball\" and to the League in violation of \u00a7 8.02 of the League Constitution. Flores ordered that the Cangrejeros Franchise remove Axon from the League Board and as a shareholder of the franchise and threatened to terminate the investor\u2011operator agreement between Cangrejeros LLC and the League. Flores also wrote to the Municipality of Humacao stating that the League did not endorse relocating the Cangrejeros Franchise there.\n\nCangrejeros LLC responded on March 17, 2022, disputing that Axon had engaged in acts detrimental to baseball or the League. On March 18, 2022, Flores convened a special League Board meeting to discuss the Cangrejeros Franchise and possible sanctions against Axon. Axon requested to attend but the Board met without him. On March 29, 2022, Flores informed Axon that the League Board\u2014comprised primarily of investor\u2011operators of the other franchises\u2014had suspended him from all functions and participation in the Cangrejeros Franchise and the League for two years, fined him $5,000, and placed him on one year of probation following the suspension.\n\nAxon then sought a preliminary injunction and declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of San Juan against the League and Flores to prevent his suspension from taking effect, alleging that the suspension would freeze the franchise\u2019s access to capital and cause operations to cease. The Superior Court held a hearing on April 22, 2022. Section 3.01 of the League Constitution provides that shareholders and official representatives must be accepted by the Board to be \"members\" of the League. The Superior Court interpreted this provision to mean that Axon was not a League \"member\" at the time of his suspension, in part because, in February 2022, Axon\u2019s counsel had designated two Cangrejeros representatives (Lino Rivera and Sa\u00fal Su\u00e1rez) to the League Board and the Board had confirmed them, which the League treated as revoking Axon\u2019s Board position. On that basis, the Superior Court concluded Axon was not entitled to the membership protections and procedures of \u00a7\u00a7 3.05 and 3.06 of the League Constitution (governing termination and separation of members), held that the League Board had authority to suspend him as a non\u2011member, and denied the preliminary injunction.\n\nAfter the Superior Court ruling, on May 17, 2022, Flores notified plaintiffs that the League was seizing Cangrejeros LLC\u2019s interests in the Cangrejeros Franchise pursuant to \u00a7 3.06 of the League Constitution. He asserted that Axon\u2019s filing of the state\u2011court action\u2014allegedly containing false representations about his League membership\u2014breached the investor\u2011operator agreement and allowed the League Board to permanently terminate Cangrejeros LLC\u2019s investor\u2011operator rights and economic interests in the franchise.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the League Board met virtually. Attendees included representatives of the defendant franchises: Raul Rodr\u00edguez (Criollos), Jos\u00e9 Feliciano and Juan Carlos Ram\u00edrez (Indios), Javier Hern\u00e1ndez (Gigantes), Roberto Alomar and Marisol Irizarry (RA12), and Oscar Misla (Leones), as well as Rivera and Su\u00e1rez on behalf of the Cangrejeros Franchise. The Board denied Axon\u2019s request to testify. Rivera argued on Cangrejeros LLC\u2019s behalf that Axon would accept a two\u2011year suspension if the League refrained from terminating Cangrejeros LLC\u2019s investor\u2011operator rights. The Board nonetheless voted to terminate Cangrejeros LLC\u2019s investor\u2011operator agreement and to seize all plaintiffs\u2019 economic and operational rights in the franchise without compensation.\n\nOn June 5, 2022, Flores announced that the League was seeking a new investor\u2011operator for the Cangrejeros Franchise and noted that two entities had expressed interest in February 2022, prior to Axon\u2019s suspension. On or about June 13, 2022, the League announced that Impulse Sports Entertainment Corporation had been selected as the new investor\u2011operator. Impulse Sports had filed for incorporation in Puerto Rico on May 20, 2022, eleven days before the League terminated Cangrejeros LLC\u2019s interests.\n\nAfter assuming control, Impulse Sports publicly stated its intention to strengthen the franchise\u2019s ties to Mayor Romero. On July 7, 2022, at a press conference introducing Impulse Sports as the new owner, Mayor Romero appeared alongside Impulse representatives in a show of government support. Impulse Sports stated it would be \"strengthening ties with the mayor,\" and Romero stated that Bithorn Stadium would be made ready for the upcoming season.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the defendants, including the League, its president, the other franchise owners, and Impulse Sports, conspired, in concert with the Mayor of San Juan, to oust Axon and seize plaintiffs\u2019 property and economic interests in the Cangrejeros Franchise in retaliation for Axon\u2019s public criticism of stadium conditions and his threats to relocate the team, and to replace plaintiffs with a more compliant operator aligned with municipal authorities.",

        "district_court_decision":"On September 12, 2022, the League, later joined by several franchise defendants, moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing (1) plaintiffs were contractually bound to litigate in Puerto Rico\u2019s local courts; and (2) the action was barred by res judicata due to the prior Superior Court case. On October 27, 2022, defendants also moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction: they asserted the federal antitrust claims were barred by the \"business of baseball\" exemption and that the Puerto Rico antitrust and fair competition claims were likewise barred because they targeted conduct constituting the business of baseball. Plaintiffs opposed both motions.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, the District Court granted the motions. It dismissed the Sherman Act claims under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the \"business of baseball\" exemption, concluding that the exemption applied to the Puerto Rican League and to the alleged conspiracy involving an owner dismissed pursuant to League regulations. The court described its ruling as the first by a lower federal court since Federal Baseball to apply the exemption to a professional baseball league other than Major League Baseball or its affiliates.\n\nThe court then dismissed the Puerto Rico antitrust and fair competition claims (Counts Three, Four, and Five), reasoning that, because the baseball exemption barred federal antitrust claims, Puerto Rico\u2019s antitrust and fair competition laws were preempted under the Supremacy Clause when applied to conduct constituting the \"business of baseball,\" citing Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258 (1972).\n\nAs to the \u00a7 1983 claim (Count Seven), the District Court dismissed it for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), holding that it was barred by res judicata. Applying former P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, \u00a7 3343, the court concluded that the prior San Juan Superior Court judgment on Axon\u2019s preliminary injunction request was a final judgment on the merits and that there was a perfect identity of thing or cause and of parties and capacities between the state case and the federal \u00a7 1983 claim.\n\nHaving dismissed all federal claims, the District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining Puerto Rico law claim (the contract\/tort claim in Count Six) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 and dismissed it without reaching its merits.",

Plaintiffs contend the alleged conspiracy to oust an owner and reassign a franchise operator, allegedly in retaliation for criticizing stadium conditions and seeking relocation and in coordination with a municipal mayor, is not the kind of on\u2011field or player\u2011related conduct central to the business of baseball.",
          "The District Court erred in treating the baseball exemption as a jurisdictional bar under Rule 12(b)(1) rather than a merits defense properly addressed under Rule 12(b)(6), conflating the existence of subject matter jurisdiction with the applicability of a substantive exemption.",

Even under \u00a7 3343\u2019s test, there was no perfect identity of parties or causes between the San Juan Superior Court action and the federal \u00a7 1983 claim: the earlier case involved Axon alone, focused on preliminary injunctive relief against a suspension, and did not include all the current federal defendants or all the property\u2011deprivation and conspiracy allegations now raised under \u00a7 1983.",

They argue the exemption is not confined to MLB specifically, but to the sport and business of professional baseball generally.",

Crist, state (and territorial) antitrust claims directed at the business of baseball are barred either because federal antitrust policy preempts state antitrust regulation in this area or because the Commerce Clause prohibits state antitrust regulation of professional baseball given the need for national uniformity and the burdens that diverse local standards would impose on interstate commerce.",

More importantly, Supreme Court precedent (Federal Baseball, Toolson, Flood) has been applied only to Major League Baseball and its organized farm system, with Flood\u2019s rationale grounded in MLB\u2019s unique, longstanding reliance interests and Congress\u2019s inaction directed specifically at MLB. No Supreme Court case extends the exemption to independent, non\u2011MLB professional leagues. A lower federal court would be reluctant to be the first to do so, especially where, as here, the league is territorially bounded and not part of MLB\u2019s organized structure. Even if the exemption could theoretically reach beyond MLB, the challenged conduct\u2014an alleged conspiracy to oust a particular owner and reassign franchise operating rights, in retaliation for criticizing stadium conditions and threatening relocation\u2014concerns ownership and internal governance of a single franchise, not the player reserve system, league structure, franchise location rules, or other core aspects of organizing professional games for the public that prior cases have treated as within the exemption. DOJ and many lower courts have read the exemption narrowly to conduct integral to staging professional baseball contests; the alleged retaliatory seizure of a franchise operator\u2019s economic interests in collusion with a municipal official is at best peripheral. Under de novo review, the district court\u2019s broad application\u2014both to a non\u2011MLB league and to this particular conduct\u2014will likely be rejected.

          "reasoning":"Preemption is a legal question reviewed de novo. The district court treated the federal baseball exemption as if it implied a federal intent to occupy the field of \u2018the business of baseball\u2019 and thereby preempt Puerto Rico\u2019s antitrust and fair\u2011competition laws when applied to the League. But the exemption is a judicially created gap in the *federal* antitrust statutes, not an expression of affirmative congressional intent to displace state or territorial antitrust regulation. Ordinarily, state antitrust law coexists with the Sherman Act; Congress has never expressly preempted state antitrust law in this domain. Flood\u2019s brief treatment of state\u2011law claims concerned MLB\u2019s nationwide reserve system and emphasized MLB\u2019s special status and the burdens of a patchwork of state regulation on an interstate industry; it does not clearly announce field or conflict preemption for all professional baseball, nor does it speak to an independent, territorially contained league whose six franchises are all within Puerto Rico. Here, the League\u2019s activities are largely intraterritorial; any interstate elements (e.g., broadcasting into the mainland or participation in the Caribbean Series) are limited and do not present the same national\u2011uniformity concerns as MLB\u2019s structure. Against that backdrop, and given the presumption against preemption in areas of traditional state economic regulation, Puerto Rico retains authority to apply its own antitrust and fair\u2011competition statutes absent a clear congressional command to the contrary. Once the broad, MLB\u2011centric reading of Flood is rejected, there is no sound basis to hold Puerto Rico\u2019s statutes preempted merely because federal antitrust law (as construed in Flood) is inapplicable or limited in scope. The dismissal of Counts Three, Four, and Five on preemption grounds is therefore likely to be reversed."

          "prediction":"REVERSE",
          "reasoning":"Claim preclusion under Puerto Rico law is a legal question, decided de novo on a motion to dismiss. The district court relied on the text of former \u00a7 3343, which had been repealed in 2020, without a careful analysis of the current Civil Code and Puerto Rico\u2019s common\u2011law preclusion principles; that alone makes its reasoning vulnerable. More importantly, even under the traditional Puerto Rico test (prior final judgment on the merits; perfect identity of thing or cause; perfect identity of parties and capacities), key elements are missing. The earlier Superior Court case involved Axon alone, sought a preliminary injunction and declaratory relief against his *suspension* from the League, and turned on his membership status and the Board\u2019s authority under the League Constitution. It did not include all current federal defendants (other franchise entities, Impulse Sports, Flores in both official and personal capacities, etc.), nor did it address the later May 2022 seizure of Cangrejeros LLC\u2019s investor\u2011operator rights, the reassignment of the franchise to Impulse, or the alleged broader conspiracy with the Mayor to deprive plaintiffs of property without due process. The present \u00a7 1983 claim arises from a broader, temporally extended course of conduct culminating in the permanent termination and alleged uncompensated seizure of franchise rights, and it invokes a different legal theory (federal constitutional due process, via state action) than the local contractual and organizational issues litigated in the preliminary injunction proceeding. Puerto Rico\u2019s \u2018perfect identity\u2019 requirements\u2014particularly as to thing or cause and parties\u2014are typically construed more strictly than the federal \u2018same transaction or occurrence\u2019 test. On this record, there is at most partial factual overlap, not a perfect identity of cause or parties. Nor is a denial of preliminary injunctive relief typically treated, under Puerto Rico law, as a final judgment on the merits precluding later damages or different claims arising from subsequent acts. Given these discrepancies, and the complaint\u2019s inclusion of entities and conduct beyond the San Juan action, the district court\u2019s across\u2011the\u2011board application of claim preclusion to bar \u00a7 1983 was too expansive. The \u00a7 1983 claim should be allowed to proceed at least as to the later termination and seizure conduct and those defendants who were not parties or in clear privity in the earlier case.

On remand, the court must reconsider supplemental jurisdiction in light of a live federal case; it may still, in theory, decline jurisdiction under other \u00a7 1367(c) factors, but its original rationale is invalid. Because the underlying premise\u2014that there were no remaining federal claims\u2014falls away, the dismissal of the contract\/tort claim should be vacated and reversed so that the district court can exercise (or explicitly re\u2011consider) supplemental jurisdiction with the federal claims pending."

Applying it to an independent Puerto Rican league\u2019s internal dispute over an owner\u2019s ouster and franchise reassignment\u2014especially treating it as jurisdictional\u2014is an aggressive move that a court of appeals is likely to reject under de novo review. Once the federal exemption is properly limited, the foundation for preemption of Puerto Rico\u2019s antitrust and fair\u2011competition statutes disappears, because the exemption is a negative implication in federal law, not a congressional command occupying the field or forbidding local economic regulation of a territorially contained league. Separately, the res judicata ruling stretches Puerto Rico\u2019s \u2018perfect identity\u2019 standard to cover a later, broader \u00a7 1983 conspiracy and property\u2011deprivation claim involving different defendants and additional, subsequent conduct; that overreach and the reliance on a repealed statute make reversal likely. Because multiple federal claims should be reinstated, \u00a7 1367(c)(3)\u2019s prerequisite (dismissal of all federal claims) is unmet, and the dismissal of the remaining Puerto Rico contract\/tort claim must also be undone. Thus, the appellate court will likely reverse the dismissal on all four issues and remand for further proceedings on the federal and Puerto Rico claims."

      "factual_background":"In 2008, Andy Luu Tran granted a mortgage on his Massachusetts home (the \"Property\") to Citizens Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\"). In 2022, after Tran defaulted, the Bank conducted a foreclosure sale of the Property pursuant to the power of sale in the mortgage. At the auction, Herbert Jacobs was the high bidder. At the close of the auction, Jacobs and the Bank executed a memorandum of sale. Subsequently, the Bank recorded an affidavit of sale in the registry of deeds. The affidavit stated the purchase price, identified Jacobs as the purchaser, and recited that the foreclosure sale complied with the notice requirements of Massachusetts law, specifically Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 15(b). A foreclosure deed from the Bank to Jacobs was also recorded along with the affidavit of sale. However, the foreclosure deed did not include the required certificate of acknowledgment or proof of due execution as mandated by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183, \u00a7 29, meaning the deed was recorded without the legally required signature\/acknowledgment page. After these recordings, Jacobs served Tran with a notice to vacate the premises. Tran continued to reside at the Property. He asserted that, pre-foreclosure, he held an equity of redemption\u2014the right to redeem and regain legal title by paying off the mortgage\u2014and that, post-foreclosure, he retained a right to any surplus sale proceeds beyond the mortgage debt and a bare possessory interest in occupying the Property. Tran contends that the foreclosure deed\u2019s lack of a proper certificate of acknowledgment rendered the recorded deed defective and that this defect, in turn, affects notice to third parties and the validity or avoidability of the transfer associated with the foreclosure.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"After receiving the notice to vacate, Tran filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. The next day, he commenced an adversary proceeding against Citizens Bank and Herbert Jacobs. In the adversary complaint, acting as a debtor in possession invoking 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 544(a)(3) and 522(h), he sought to avoid what he characterized as the \"transfer of title\" to the Property that occurred through the foreclosure. He asserted that the foreclosure deed was improperly recorded without the required certificate of acknowledgment under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 183, \u00a7 29, and argued that, under the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s \"strong arm\" powers, a trustee (and, by extension, he as debtor in possession) could avoid the transfer because it was not properly perfected and would not be effective against a hypothetical bona fide purchaser of the Property.",
        "district_court_decision":"In the adversary proceeding, Tran filed motions for judgment on the pleadings, which the bankruptcy court converted into motions for summary judgment. The Bank and Jacobs filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The bankruptcy court determined that, under Massachusetts law, legal title to the mortgaged Property was held by the Bank, and Tran held an equitable interest known as the equity of redemption. It ruled that the only \"transfer\" relevant under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544 in connection with the foreclosure was the extinguishment of Tran\u2019s equity of redemption, because legal title was already in the Bank\u2019s name. The court held that this equity of redemption was extinguished at the conclusion of the foreclosure auction when the Bank and Jacobs executed the memorandum of sale. The delivery and recording of the foreclosure deed afterward affected only limited rights and did not revive Tran\u2019s extinguished equity of redemption. Assuming, without deciding, that Tran had standing under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(h) to exercise the trustee\u2019s avoiding powers, the bankruptcy court further held that the properly recorded affidavit of sale provided constructive notice to a hypothetical good-faith purchaser of the foreclosure and extinguishment of the equity of redemption. Therefore, a bankruptcy trustee could not avoid that transfer under \u00a7 544(a)(3). Because it resolved the case on the basis of the affidavit of sale providing constructive notice, the bankruptcy court did not reach the separate question whether a deed recorded without a signature\/acknowledgment page would itself provide constructive notice under Massachusetts law. The bankruptcy court also denied Tran\u2019s motion for relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023 on the same grounds. Tran appealed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.",

Massachusetts Gen.

State law treats such recorded instruments as part of the registry record that imparts constructive notice of the facts they recite to third parties searching the title. The bankruptcy court assumed, arguendo, that the foreclosure deed might be defective, but concluded that the recorded affidavit itself gave constructive notice that a power-of-sale foreclosure had occurred and that the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption had been extinguished. That reasoning is consistent with the concept that one instrument (the deed) may be defective as a conveyance or as notice of a conveyance, while another duly recorded instrument (the foreclosure affidavit) can nonetheless provide notice of the foreclosure event and of the termination of the equity of redemption. In re Mbazira involved an unacknowledged mortgage that failed to give constructive notice of a lien; it did not address whether a statutorily authorized, properly recorded foreclosure affidavit gives notice of a completed foreclosure and extinguishment of the equity of redemption. Given the distinct function of the foreclosure affidavit and the plain terms of \u00a7 15(b), the courts below reasonably held that a hypothetical bona fide purchaser would be on constructive notice that Tran\u2019s equity of redemption had already been foreclosed as of the petition date.

Massachusetts law does recognize that, after foreclosure, the mortgagor may retain a statutory right to surplus sale proceeds and, if still in occupation, a possessory interest that can qualify as \u201cproperty of the estate\u201d for certain bankruptcy purposes. But \u00a7 544(a)(3) targets avoidable \u201ctransfers\u201d of the debtor\u2019s property; it does not provide a free-standing vehicle to litigate or enhance whatever residual rights remain. Here, Tran identifies no separate post-foreclosure event that transferred his surplus-right claim or his possessory interest to the Bank or to Jacobs in a manner that is unperfected or otherwise avoidable by a hypothetical bona fide purchaser as of the petition date. The only foreclosure-related transfer is the extinguishment of the equity of redemption, which had been completed prepetition and is, as explained above, not avoidable because of constructive notice. The continued existence of surplus-right or occupancy interests does not retroactively convert the completed foreclosure into a further avoidable transfer; nor do those residual rights themselves undergo any additional, unperfected conveyance tied to the petition date.

She was transported to the emergency room at Lowell General Hospital (LGH) and later admitted. Hospital staff determined that Allen was approximately seven months pregnant and suffering from severe hypertension. Dr. Fernando Roca, an obstetrician, was on call at LGH and attended to Allen. Dr. Roca determined that an emergency caesarean section was necessary and delivered Allen's baby girl. After the delivery, Allen was unresponsive and transferred to the intensive care unit, where a brain scan revealed a 'devastating neurological injury.' She was then airlifted by helicopter to a tertiary care hospital in Boston. Allen died eleven days later; her cause of death was listed as 'intracranial hemorrhage and eclampsia.'\n\nAt the time he rendered care to Allen, Dr. Roca was employed by Lowell Community Health Center (LCHC), a federally funded health center receiving grants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 245b. LCHC had been 'deemed' a Public Health Service (PHS) program under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233 for the relevant time period. As a condition of his employment at LCHC, Dr. Roca was required to have clinical privileges at a nearby hospital; he obtained those privileges at LGH. To maintain privileges at LGH, he had to comply with LGH's rules and bylaws, which included participating in the hospital's on-call rotation and providing on-call or emergency coverage, including for non-LCHC patients. LCHC required him to participate in its 'departmental call schedule,' which entailed caring for LCHC patients at approved hospitals within a reasonable vicinity, including LGH, and to maintain hospital privileges at such a hospital. LGH conditioned admitting privileges on satisfaction of its on-call coverage requirements, and Dr. Roca's treatment of Allen occurred while he was serving in such a call rotation.",

On appeal, the government later acknowledged it had relied on the wrong statutory scheme (the Westfall Act rather than the Public Health Service Act (PHSA)) for substitution. The First Circuit vacated the initial substitution order and remanded for further proceedings because the misidentification of the applicable statute introduced new issues and evidentiary gaps. On remand, the United States again moved for substitution, this time under the PHSA and its implementing regulations, arguing that LCHC was a deemed PHS entity and that Dr. Roca's care of Allen was covered by that deeming. On September 6, 2024, the district court granted the government's renewed motion to substitute the United States as the defendant and again dismissed O'Brien's complaint for failure to comply with the FTCA's presentment and limitations requirements, including a finding that his claim was time-barred and not saved by the FTCA's Savings Clause.",

O'Brien contends that, by statute, health centers and their employees are generally deemed federal employees only when providing services to health-center patients, and that any extension of coverage to non-patient services must be based on a particularized deeming determination supported by specific documentation for the care at issue, not via generic pre-determinations.",
          "Even if categorical pre-deeming is sometimes permissible, O'Brien argues that Dr. Roca's treatment of Allen does not fall within 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.6(e)(4)(ii)'s 'Hospital-Related Activities' because his employment contract with LCHC merely required him to obtain and maintain hospital admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and participate in LCHC's departmental call schedule for LCHC patients, but did not expressly require him to provide hospital emergency room coverage or treat non-LCHC patients. O'Brien contends that, without a contractual obligation to treat non-clinic patients like Allen and without a particularized deeming application covering such services, FTCA protection does not extend to Dr. Roca's care of Allen and the United States should not have been substituted.",
          "O'Brien further contends that 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.6(e)(4)(ii) expressly requires 'documentation for the particular health care provider that this coverage is a condition of employment at the health center' and that no such documentation was submitted or approved showing that providing on-call coverage for non-LCHC patients at LGH was a condition of Dr. Roca\u2019s employment. Accordingly, he argues, the regulatory requirements for automatic coverage of hospital on-call activities were not satisfied.",
          "On the statute of limitations, O'Brien argues that his FTCA claim did not accrue until September 6, 2017, when he first spoke to a lawyer and learned that Dr. Roca\u2019s management of Allen\u2019s eclampsia might not have met the applicable standard of care and could be a cause of her death. He relies on the fact that Allen\u2019s death certificate listed 'eclampsia as a consequence of pregnancy' as the cause of death, which he characterizes as a natural cause, giving him no reason, as a layperson without medical expertise, to suspect that negligent care contributed to her death. Thus, he maintains that the factual basis for a malpractice claim was 'inherently unknowable' until counsel informed him of the potential negligence, and that, applying the discovery rule, accrual should be set at the date of that consultation, making his June 2019 filing timely.",
          "O'Brien argues that, unlike the generally healthy woman in Sanchez or other decedents in prior cases, Allen was already in a serious medical emergency before arriving at the hospital, so a reasonable person would attribute her death to the underlying condition rather than to her medical care. He contends that this context made it reasonable not to suspect negligence or to investigate earlier, and that the discovery rule should therefore toll the statute until he learned from counsel of potential malpractice.",

He argues that his state-court action was filed within two years of the date he reasonably understood he had a claim, and that the timing and sequence of his filings should qualify him for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(5), thereby excusing any failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing in state court."

According to the government, the statute does not demand a separate application for each discrete instance or type of non-patient care; a single application and subsequent categorical determinations by the Secretary are sufficient. Requiring health centers to submit individualized applications for every possible future non-patient interaction would be impractical and burdensome.",

It maintains that LCHC required Dr. Roca to obtain and maintain hospital privileges at a hospital within a reasonable vicinity, including LGH, and to participate in LCHC\u2019s departmental call schedule. To maintain privileges at LGH, he had to comply with LGH\u2019s bylaws and regulations, which in turn required him to participate in periodic hospital call rotations and provide emergency and on-call coverage, including for non-LCHC patients. The government argues that this chain of obligations means that providing on-call coverage for non-LCHC patients like Allen was effectively a condition of his employment at LCHC and of his hospital privileges, satisfying \u00a7 6.6(e)(4)(ii).",
          "On the documentation requirement, the government asserts that it has produced sufficient documentation showing that LGH conditioned admitting privileges on satisfaction of on-call coverage requirements and that LCHC required Dr. Roca to obtain and maintain such privileges and to adhere to hospital rules and bylaws. This, the government argues, constitutes the necessary 'documentation for the particular health care provider' that on-call coverage is a condition of employment at the health center, thereby triggering automatic FTCA coverage for his hospital-based on-call activities.",
          "With respect to the statute of limitations, the government argues that O'Brien's FTCA claim accrued no later than the date of Allen\u2019s death, August 6, 2016, because O'Brien knew of the injury (Allen\u2019s death) and the identity of the medical providers involved, including Dr. Roca and LGH. Even if the precise cause of death or existence of negligence was not immediately known, this information was sufficient to place a reasonable person on inquiry notice and to trigger a duty to investigate possible malpractice. The government maintains that the death of a pregnant woman in childbirth or related circumstances is sufficiently unusual to prompt reasonable inquiry, and that O'Brien has not shown that the factual basis for his claim was 'inherently unknowable.'",
          "The government further contends that, even accepting O'Brien\u2019s account that he did not suspect malpractice until consulting an attorney, he did not act with reasonable diligence. He waited more than a year after Allen\u2019s death to consult a lawyer and then, after that consultation on September 6, 2017, had roughly eleven months remaining within the FTCA\u2019s two-year limitations period to present an administrative claim but failed to do so. On this basis, the government argues that the FTCA\u2019s two-year presentment requirement expired in August 2018 and that O'Brien\u2019s June 2019 filing was untimely under \u00a7 2401(b).",
          "Regarding the FTCA Savings Clause, the government relies on Gonzalez and \u00a7 2679(d)(5) to argue that the provision cannot revive a claim that was already time-barred when the state court action commenced. The Savings Clause applies only where (1) the tort claim accrued within two years before the filing of the state court action and (2) the administrative claim is filed within sixty days after dismissal of the civil action. The government contends that O'Brien fails the first requirement because, under the government\u2019s view of accrual (no later than August 2016), his March 2021 state-court filing was outside the two-year window. Thus, the Savings Clause does not preserve his claim."

The undisputed facts show: (1) LCHC required Dr. Roca, as a condition of employment, to obtain and maintain hospital privileges at a nearby facility such as LGH and to participate in LCHC\u2019s departmental call schedule; (2) LGH, in turn, conditioned such privileges on participation in its on\u2011call rotation and on providing on\u2011call\/emergency coverage, including for non\u2011LCHC patients; and (3) Dr. Roca\u2019s care of Allen occurred while fulfilling this on\u2011call obligation. Section 6.6(e)(4)(ii) covers hospital\u2011related activities where periodic hospital call or ER coverage is a condition of hospital admitting privileges and there is documentation for the particular provider that this coverage is a condition of employment at the health center. The combination of LCHC\u2019s employment requirements and the LGH bylaws, together with documentation tying those obligations to Dr. Roca\u2019s position, is sufficient to satisfy the regulation\u2019s documentation requirement. The regulation does not demand an express clause in the employment contract stating in haec verba that the physician must treat non\u2011clinic patients; it is enough that, as a practical and documented matter, the health center makes maintenance of such hospital privileges\u2014and their incident on\u2011call duties\u2014a condition of employment.

Allen died on August 6, 2016, following emergency treatment and a catastrophic neurological injury in the context of severe hypertension and eclampsia, after she initially survived long enough to be transferred to another facility. O\u2019Brien knew of the injury (death) and the treatment setting, and he knew the identities of the principal medical providers. Under Kubrick and First Circuit cases such as Skwira, Donahue, and Gonzalez, that knowledge is typically enough to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice and to trigger a duty to investigate possible malpractice; the discovery rule delays accrual only when the factual basis of the claim is 'inherently unknowable' despite reasonable diligence. The death of a relatively young pregnant woman after emergency hospital care is not the type of event that is presumptively natural and beyond question; rather, it is the kind of unusual outcome that prompts, at minimum, inquiry. The fact that the death certificate lists intracranial hemorrhage and eclampsia as the cause of death does not render the causal connection to the medical care unknowable; it simply identifies the medical mechanism, which itself raises the question whether the care met the standard of care. Moreover, O\u2019Brien waited more than a year to consult counsel; even accepting his claim that he did not suspect negligence until that consultation, he has not shown the level of diligence required to invoke the 'inherently unknowable' doctrine. On this record, the claim accrued no later than the date of Allen\u2019s death, and in any event well before two years prior to the June 2019 administrative presentment. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the FTCA claim was untimely is therefore sound and likely to be upheld."

The Savings Clause deems a claim timely presented only if (A) the administrative claim 'would have been timely' had it been filed on the date the civil action was commenced, and (B) the claimant actually presents the administrative claim within 60 days after dismissal. Under Gonzalez, this provision cannot resuscitate a claim that was already time\u2011barred when the state action began. Because, as the district court correctly concluded, O\u2019Brien\u2019s FTCA claim accrued no later than Allen\u2019s death in August 2016, any claim had to be presented within two years of that date\u2014by August 2018. His state\u2011court complaint was not filed until March 2021, well outside that two\u2011year window. Accordingly, condition (A) of \u00a7 2679(d)(5) is not met: the claim would not have been timely if filed on the date the state action was commenced. The Savings Clause therefore cannot preserve the claim, regardless of whether he complied with the 60\u2011day refiling requirement after dismissal.

Because the claim was already time\u2011barred when the state action was filed, the FTCA Savings Clause cannot revive it under Gonzalez.

      },
      "factual_background":"Steven Douglas Coleman is a prominent jazz saxophonist who, beginning when Maria Kim Grand was a teenager, acted as her saxophone teacher and professional mentor. Coleman was approximately thirty\u2011five years older than Grand. The relationship between them developed into what both sides agree was an intermittent sexual relationship that overlapped with an ongoing professional relationship from about 2011 to 2016, during which Coleman trained Grand and hired her for musical work.\n\nIn November 2017, in the context of the #MeToo movement, Grand drafted and emailed a seven\u2011page, single\u2011spaced letter to roughly forty friends and colleagues in the music industry. The letter, which Grand asked not to be made public because she believed it was legally risky to publish, was framed as her personal account of her \"experience\" with sexism in the music industry and as a contribution to the broader #MeToo conversation. She stated her goal was to speak up about sexism, raise awareness, and start a larger discussion about what conduct is acceptable in professional relationships.\n\nIn the letter, Grand described what she characterized as an intermittent 'quid pro quo' sexual relationship with Coleman from 2011 to 2016. She wrote that Coleman, whom she anonymized as 'X' to protect herself from legal repercussions, pressured her to have a sexual relationship in exchange for his training and mentorship. Among other things, Grand recounted that:\n- About six months after she moved to New York in 2011, Coleman \"convinced\" her to be intimate with him. She stated that he had told her it was not interesting for him to talk to her if there was going to be no sexual interaction.\n- When he was teaching her, he would pressure her to be intimate with him and became angry when she refused to have sex.\n- He made her share hotel rooms with him when they traveled for work, including on a 2011 Chicago workshop trip; she agreed in advance to share the room but described feeling she had to do so to attend.\n- He would offer her work and training opportunities, and she wrote that he would sometimes withhold or condition those opportunities on whether she slept with him, including allegedly waiting to \"solidify the dates\" of work until after she had sex with him, and becoming \"absolutely angry\" and sometimes refusing to rehearse if she did not sleep with him at the end of tour days.\n- She stated that he told her she owed him a \"lifetime of pussy\" for what he had taught her, and that when she texted him that she was suicidal, he responded that he looked forward to her 'breaking down' so that she would come to him.\n- She wrote that he would call her in the middle of the night and \"never take no for an answer,\" and that he \"relentlessly\" asked her to have sex with him, getting really angry when she refused.\n- She recounted an incident in which she woke up during the Chicago trip to find Coleman half\u2011naked, in bed with her, kissing her on the lips, after she had told him she did not want to sleep with him, and another incident in which Coleman took photographs of her while she was sleeping.\n\nGrand characterized this conduct as sexual harassment within a professional relationship and wrote that by September 2013 she no longer loved Coleman and did not want to be intimate with him, and that \"that period is when the sexual harassment started.\" She described the relationship as emotionally abusive and professionally coercive, summarizing that when she stopped agreeing to sleep with him, he stopped granting her access to his knowledge and made her professional life with him \"a complete nightmare.\"\n\nAt the same time, Grand\u2019s letter candidly discussed her own role and feelings. She stated that she did not intend to portray herself solely as a victim, acknowledged that she had been \"manipulative\" because she did not want Coleman\u2019s attention to stop, admitted that she fell in love with him, craved his attention, and at times desperately tried to engage him so as not to lose his mentorship and her professional relationship with him. She acknowledged that Coleman broke up with her in 2013 and told her not to bother him anymore, yet she continued to pursue contact and to agree to sleep with him in part to preserve the relationship. She wrote that she had \"agreed\" to sleep with Coleman when sexual encounters occurred, explicitly noted that he never physically forced her to have sex, and that he \"convinced\" rather than physically coerced her to be intimate. She continued to express admiration and immense respect for Coleman as a musician and an elder, stated that she was \"eternally grateful\" for what he had taught her, and that she valued their work together.\n\nColeman maintains that the sexual relationship was consensual, that Grand sometimes initiated intimacy and contact, and that she manipulated him to gain professional advantages. He disputes that he harassed her, or that he conditioned professional opportunities on sexual favors or refused to accept \"no\" in the ways she described. He points to evidence such as Grand\u2019s prior emails indicating she did not mind sharing a hotel room; her deposition testimony that he never physically forced her to go to his room or to have sex; and her acknowledgment that she had lied to her mother about being forced to have sex with him on the 2011 Chicago trip. Coleman also contends that multiple band members quit his band and several organizers canceled engagements after learning of Grand\u2019s letter, allegedly due to the \"cloud\" created by the accusations.",

        "claims_brought":"In October 2018, Coleman filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Grand, alleging defamation under New York law arising out of the November 2017 letter. In his complaint and summary judgment submissions, he asserted that the letter contained untrue statements accusing him of a pattern of abuse, sexual harassment, and nonconsensual sexual acts, and that those statements damaged his personal and professional reputation and caused significant economic harm. Grand filed counterclaims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, asserting that certain statements by Coleman were defamatory and tortious.",
        "district_court_decision":"After discovery, the parties filed cross\u2011motions for summary judgment. Coleman\u2019s motion argued that four specific statements in Grand\u2019s letter were provably false and defamatory: (1) the statement that when she moved to New York in 2011, Coleman 'convinced [her] to be intimate with him'; (2) the statement that she was 'sexually harassed' within a professional relationship; (3) the statement that the sexual harassment began in September 2013, when she 'wasn\u2019t in love with him anymore' and 'didn\u2019t want to be intimate with him anymore'; and (4) the statement that Coleman would call her in the middle of the night and 'never take no for an answer.' In opposing Grand\u2019s cross\u2011motion, Coleman also asserted that the letter falsely insinuated that she had been forced to go to his hotel room during the 2011 Chicago trip. Grand\u2019s cross\u2011motion for summary judgment argued, among other things, that her letter consisted of non\u2011actionable opinion supported by disclosed facts and that the content was substantially true. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Grand on Coleman\u2019s defamation claim. The court concluded that, under New York\u2019s anti\u2011SLAPP law and associated standards, Coleman had not adduced evidence from which a reasonable jury could find, by clear and convincing evidence, that Grand acted with actual malice in publishing the challenged statements, and that, in any event, the statements at issue were protected expressions of opinion rather than demonstrably false statements of fact.

          "He argues that the district court erred in holding that he failed to raise a triable issue of actual malice. Coleman asserts that because Grand\u2019s allegations concern events within her own personal knowledge and relatively recent in time, if her allegations were false a reasonable jury could find that she made them knowing they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth. He further argues that New York\u2019s 2020 anti\u2011SLAPP amendments and the associated heightened actual\u2011malice standard should not have been applied retroactively to his case, and in any event that her private email to some friends and colleagues was not the sort of public petition or participation contemplated by the statute.",
          "Coleman also maintains that the district court improperly parsed individual phrases apart from the overall context of the letter and from his theory of defamation. He contends that the letter, read as a whole, accuses him of serious and ongoing workplace\u2011type sexual harassment and abusive conduct, that he disputes Grand\u2019s description of the relationship as harassing or unwanted, and that the overall factual narrative\u2014rather than being a purely subjective expression\u2014would be understood by reasonable readers as a set of factual allegations about his conduct.

She maintains that phrases such as 'convinced me to be intimate,' 'sexually harassed inside a professional relationship,' 'that period is when the sexual harassment started,' that Coleman 'never took no for an answer,' and her description of feeling forced to go to his hotel room, are evaluative characterizations of disclosed events and of how she felt about them, rather than independent factual assertions implying undisclosed misconduct.

Grand contends that under New York\u2019s doctrine protecting opinion based on disclosed facts, her characterizations of Coleman\u2019s conduct\u2014such as calling it 'sexual harassment'\u2014are protected speech because readers are given the factual basis and can draw their own conclusions about whether his conduct merits that label.",

It recites in detail the underlying events (travel, hotel sharing, late\u2011night calls, text exchanges, his words to her) and then uses characterizing phrases such as \u2018convinced me to be intimate,\u2019 \u2018sexually harassed inside a professional relationship,\u2019 \u2018that period is when the sexual harassment started,\u2019 and \u2018never take no for an answer.\u2019 New York law treats evaluative characterizations explicitly tied to disclosed facts as protected opinion so long as they do not imply undisclosed defamatory facts. Here, readers are given the factual basis and can decide for themselves whether the conduct amounts to pressure, harassment, or coercion. Terms like \u2018harassment\u2019 in this context are inherently elastic and depend heavily on the speaker\u2019s perspective. The insinuation about feeling forced to go to the hotel room is also embedded in a disclosed narrative that she agreed in advance to share the room but felt she had to do so to attend, signaling that she is describing compulsion in an emotional\/psychological sense. Given this context, a reviewing court is likely to agree with the district court that these are Grand\u2019s subjective assessments and impressions, not discrete, verifiable factual assertions beyond the recounted conduct, and thus cannot sustain a defamation claim under New York\u2019s fact\u2011versus\u2011opinion doctrine."

Grand\u2019s statements concern her own direct experiences. There is no evidence she fabricated events or subjectively believed her characterizations were false. Disputes about whether conduct amounted to \u2018harassment\u2019 or whether he \u2018never\u2019 accepted \u2018no\u2019 reflect differences in perception and memory, not proof that she knew her descriptions were false or entertained serious doubts about them.

In context, Grand carefully narrates the course of the relationship, openly acknowledging consensual sex, her own agency, and the absence of physical force, while also recounting specific behaviors she experienced as coercive or abusive: pressure for sex linked to professional opportunities, angry reactions to refusals, the \u2018lifetime of pussy\u2019 remark, late\u2011night calls, and unwanted contact while she slept. She expressly frames \u2018that period is when the sexual harassment started\u2019 as her retrospective characterization of a time when she no longer loved him and did not want intimacy but felt pressured in a professional hierarchy. New York courts generally treat such evaluative terms\u2014especially in informal, first\u2011person narratives with detailed factual recitations\u2014as non\u2011actionable opinion, because readers see both the conduct and her label and can decide if they agree.

The narrative\u2019s form, content, and social context strongly align with New York\u2019s protection for opinion based on disclosed facts. Grand\u2019s letter openly recounts the underlying events and her own complicity and ambivalence, undercutting any implication that she is asserting undisclosed, concrete crimes or workplace violations. Terms like \u2018convinced,\u2019 \u2018never take no for an answer,\u2019 and \u2018sexual harassment\u2019 describe her subjective experience of a power\u2011imbalanced relationship rather than introducing distinct factual propositions beyond the disclosed conduct. That structure fits squarely within New York precedents that deem such characterizations non\u2011actionable opinion in context. Separately, on the fault element, the absence of any evidence that Grand fabricated events or disbelieved her own account makes it exceedingly difficult for Coleman to meet a clear\u2011and\u2011convincing actual\u2011malice standard, whether derived from New York\u2019s anti\u2011SLAPP statute or constitutional principles regarding speech on matters of public concern (#MeToo\u2011related allegations against a well\u2011known figure). An appellate panel can therefore affirm either on the opinion ground alone or additionally on the lack of evidence of actual malice, and is unlikely to disturb the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Grand on Coleman\u2019s defamation claim. Accordingly, the overall outcome is best predicted as an affirmance."

Ann. tit. 21\u2011A, \u00a7 1064). The Act\u2019s stated purpose is to prohibit foreign governments and \u201cforeign government\u2011influenced entities\u201d from contributing to, spending on, or otherwise influencing candidate elections and ballot initiatives in Maine, with the stated aim of preventing what supporters call \u201cforeign interference\u201d in elections.\n\nThe Act was proposed after a series of contentious political fights in Maine, particularly surrounding a large energy transmission project known as the \u201cCMP Corridor.\u201d The CMP Corridor is a joint project between Central Maine Power (CMP) and H.Q. Energy Services (U.S.) Inc. (HQUS), a subsidiary of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, a Canadian public utility owned by the Province of Qu\u00e9bec. The project would connect Canadian-generated electricity to Massachusetts via a transmission line running through Maine. The project was unpopular with many Maine voters, who used multiple ballot initiatives to attempt to halt its development. Maine voters also considered, but ultimately rejected, another ballot initiative that would have used eminent domain to seize the assets of CMP and Versant Power and replace them with a quasi\u2011governmental entity.\n\nCMP and Versant are the two primary electric utilities operating in Maine. Both are Maine corporations that have operated exclusively in Maine for roughly a century or more and are run by U.S. citizens. CMP, however, is a subsidiary of Avangrid Inc., a publicly traded U.S. corporation. At the time this litigation was filed, 81.6% of Avangrid\u2019s shares were owned by Iberdrola, S.A., a Spain\u2011based corporation; Iberdrola subsequently came to own 100% of Avangrid. Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund owned a significant indirect stake in CMP (estimated at between 7% and 11%) through its holdings of Iberdrola and Avangrid shares. HQUS is wholly owned by the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec. Versant is likewise incorporated in Maine and operated there, but its parent is wholly owned by the City of Calgary in Alberta, Canada. Versant\u2019s operations are subject to a stipulation, approved by the Maine Public Utilities Commission, prohibiting Calgary from participating in Versant\u2019s operations or management decisions.\n\nThese utilities and related entities spent large sums in Maine politics in connection with the CMP Corridor and other ballot measures. Between 2013 and 2023, CMP and its affiliates contributed nearly $73 million combined to political action committees and ballot question committees; HQUS contributed approximately $22 million; Versant contributed more than $16 million between August 2020 and the end of 2023. These levels of spending far exceeded typical corporate political contributions in the state.\n\nSome Maine voters and legislators objected to this spending, in significant part because of the foreign public or foreign\u2011linked ownership of CMP, Versant, and HQUS. Opponents characterized the spending as a form of foreign interference in Maine\u2019s elections. In response, they pursued legislation aimed at barring political spending by companies regarded as influenced by foreign governments or foreign government\u2011owned companies. Multiple legislative efforts failed, partly due to concerns that such restrictions might be unconstitutional. Eventually, supporters advanced the policy via a citizen\u2011initiated ballot question in 2023, which the voters approved by a large margin.\n\nThe Act prohibits a \u201cforeign government\u2011influenced entity\u201d from making, directly or indirectly, any contribution, expenditure, independent expenditure, electioneering communication, or other donation or disbursement of funds to influence the nomination or election of a candidate or the initiation or approval of a referendum. A \u201cforeign government\u2011influenced entity\u201d is defined in three ways: (1) a foreign government (broadly defined to include governments exercising de facto or de jure authority over a foreign country or part of one, their subdivisions, and insurgent bodies assuming governmental authority); (2) any firm, partnership, corporation, association, organization, or other entity in which a foreign government or \u201cforeign government\u2011owned entity\u201d (defined as an entity more than 50% owned or controlled by a foreign government) holds, owns, controls, or otherwise has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 5% or more of total equity, voting shares, or comparable ownership interests; or (3) such an entity where a foreign government or foreign government\u2011owned entity directs, dictates, controls, or directly or indirectly participates in decision\u2011making about the entity\u2019s political activities, such as contributions, expenditures, or electioneering communications.\n\nThe Act further:\n- Prohibits knowingly soliciting, accepting, or receiving contributions or donations barred by the core spending prohibition.\n- Prohibits knowingly or recklessly providing substantial assistance in making prohibited contributions, expenditures, or communications, or in soliciting or receiving prohibited funds.\n- Prohibits structuring or attempting to structure transactions to evade the Act\u2019s prohibitions and requirements.\n\nA knowing violation of these substantive prohibitions (subsections 2\u20135) is classified as a Class C crime under Maine law, punishable by up to five years\u2019 imprisonment. Civil penalties for any violation of the Act can include a fine up to the greater of $5,000 or double the amount of the prohibited spending, with the Ethics and Election Commission given discretion to set penalties based in part on intent and any concealment of the foreign\u2011influenced nature of the entity.\n\nThe Act also imposes obligations on media and online platforms. It requires each television or radio broadcasting station, cable or satellite television provider, print news outlet, and Internet platform to establish due\u2011diligence policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to prevent them from broadcasting or distributing public communications for which a foreign government\u2011influenced entity has made a prohibited expenditure, independent expenditure, electioneering communication, or disbursement. If an Internet platform discovers it has distributed such a communication, it must remove it immediately and notify the Ethics and Election Commission.\n\nAdditionally, when a foreign government\u2011influenced entity finances an otherwise permissible public communication intended to influence the public or a government body or official regarding government policy or relations with a foreign country or political party, the communication must include a disclaimer stating it is \u201cSponsored by [name of entity]\u201d and label the sponsor as a \u201cforeign government\u2011influenced entity\u201d or \u201cforeign government.\u201d\n\nThe enforcement of the Act rests largely with the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, which has authority to assess civil penalties and promulgate rules implementing the statute, including rules interpreting what counts as \u201cparticipation\u201d by foreign governments in corporate political decision\u2011making.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"After the ballot initiative passed in 2023, several sets of plaintiffs filed separate but related federal actions in the United States District Court for the District of Maine. On December 12, 2023, Central Maine Power Company (CMP) sued Maine state officials and entities responsible for enforcing the Act (collectively, \"Maine\"), including the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices and its members, as well as the Maine Attorney General. CMP alleged that the Act was facially invalid under the First Amendment, arguing that the Act\u2019s speech\u2011restrictive provisions violated constitutional protections and that any unconstitutional provisions could not be severed from the rest. CMP moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the Act from taking effect.\n\nShortly thereafter, Versant Power and its Canadian parent ENMAX Corporation filed a similar complaint. They also asserted First Amendment challenges and additionally contended that the Act was preempted by federal law, specifically the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), among other claims.\n\nThe Maine Press Association and the Maine Association of Broadcasters then filed their own complaint, targeting subsection 7\u2019s due\u2011diligence requirement for media and online platforms. They alleged that the due\u2011diligence mandate was unconstitutionally vague and violated the First Amendment rights of press and media entities.\n\nA group of individual Maine voters and electors \u2013 Jane P. Pringle, Kenneth Fletcher, Bonnie S. Gould, Brenda Garrand, and Lawrence Wold (collectively, the Electors) \u2013 brought another complaint asserting a variety of federal and state constitutional claims. They alleged that, as voters, they had rights to receive and consider political speech in elections and referenda and that the Act infringed those rights by restricting who could speak and what communications could be disseminated.\n\nEach set of plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to stop enforcement of some or all of the Act before it took effect.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court consolidated the related cases. After reviewing the parties\u2019 and amici\u2019s submissions, it held a hearing on February 23, 2024. Given the compressed timeline before the Act\u2019s effective date, the court addressed and resolved the motions for a preliminary injunction based specifically on the record and arguments presented by CMP and Versant.\n\nOn preemption, the district court concluded that, insofar as the Act purported to regulate foreign spending related to federal office elections, it was likely preempted by FECA\u2019s express preemption provision, but that it was likely not preempted as applied to state and local elections. The court then turned to the First Amendment challenges.\n\nThe court recognized that a facial overbreadth challenge in the First Amendment context succeeds if a substantial number of a law\u2019s applications are unconstitutional in relation to the law\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep. It applied the four\u2011factor preliminary\u2011injunction test (likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, balance of harms, and public interest), and identified likelihood of success on the merits as the linchpin in this First Amendment case.\n\nOn the merits, the court first addressed the applicable level of scrutiny. Maine argued for the more deferential standard of \u201cexacting scrutiny\u201d typically used for limits on campaign contributions, whereas the plaintiffs argued that the Act\u2019s comprehensive restraints on political spending, including expenditures and electioneering communications, required strict scrutiny. The court applied strict scrutiny to the Act as a whole.\n\nThe district court concluded that Maine had a compelling interest in limiting foreign government influence in state candidate elections, and, for purposes of the preliminary injunction, assumed without deciding that Maine also had a compelling interest in limiting foreign government influence in referenda. However, the court determined that Maine did not have a compelling interest in limiting the mere appearance of foreign government influence in elections.\n\nThe court then examined whether the Act was narrowly tailored to those interests. It found that the Act\u2019s prohibition on spending by foreign governments themselves in state elections was likely narrowly tailored, especially with respect to referenda, because federal law does not independently address such foreign government spending in state ballot measures.\n\nHowever, the court identified tailoring problems with two other components of the Act\u2019s definition of \"foreign government\u2011influenced entity.\" First, it found that the 5% foreign ownership threshold was likely not narrowly tailored. The court noted that this threshold appeared arbitrary, could silence corporations overwhelmingly owned and controlled by U.S. citizens (such as CMP and Versant), and that Maine had offered no evidence that foreign governments holding less than full ownership of a domestic corporation had actually exerted influence over that corporation\u2019s political spending in Maine.\n\nSecond, the court examined the provision covering entities in which a foreign government or foreign government\u2011owned entity \"directs, dictates, controls or directly or indirectly participates\" in political decision\u2011making. While the court initially viewed this conduct\u2011based definition as closer to the state\u2019s interest, it concluded that Maine\u2019s then\u2011proposed implementing rules from the Ethics and Election Commission appeared to extend the statute beyond actual participation to broader notions of \"influence.\" The court reasoned that this could encompass situations where domestic corporations received unsolicited communications from foreign governments, and thus could chill domestic political speech without proof of actual foreign participation in decisions. It therefore found this aspect likely not narrowly tailored.\n\nBased on its conclusion that a substantial number of the Act\u2019s applications were likely unconstitutional in relation to its legitimate sweep, and after finding that the remaining preliminary\u2011injunction factors favored the plaintiffs, the district court entered a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Act in its entirety. The court noted Maine\u2019s severability doctrine but declined, at this preliminary stage and in light of the compressed schedule, to attempt to sever specific provisions, expressly reserving that question for fuller briefing and later decision.",

          "Maine contends that the district court applied an unduly stringent level of scrutiny by reviewing the entire Act under strict scrutiny. It argues that, under Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent, contribution limits are evaluated under exacting or \"closely drawn\" scrutiny, not strict scrutiny, because contributions lie at the periphery of core political expression. Maine maintains that, to the extent the Act regulates contributions, exacting scrutiny should apply, and that a similar or intermediate level of scrutiny is appropriate for certain foreign\u2011influence restrictions given the state\u2019s prerogatives to limit participation of non\u2011citizens in its democratic processes.",
          "Maine asserts that it has compelling or at least sufficiently important interests in: (a) limiting foreign government influence in elections for state and local office and in referenda; and (b) limiting the appearance of such foreign influence, so that the public has confidence that electoral outcomes reflect the will of the domestic electorate. It relies in part on Bluman v. FEC and related cases recognizing governmental interests in keeping foreign nationals from participating directly in American democratic self\u2011governance.",
          "On tailoring, Maine defends the 5% ownership threshold as a reasonable and non\u2011arbitrary proxy for meaningful foreign influence over corporate decision\u2011making. It argues that a shareholder with as little as 5% of a corporation\u2019s equity can wield substantial influence, including through the threat of selling a large block of shares or through corporate governance mechanisms, and that corporate managers have fiduciary incentives to anticipate and accommodate the preferences of significant shareholders. Maine notes that federal securities law (e.g., Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(d)) triggers special disclosure obligations at 5% ownership, and that other jurisdictions and policy regimes have used 5% as a material ownership threshold, indicating that the line is neither novel nor irrational.",
          "Maine also argues that it need not present extensive empirical evidence of actual foreign control or manipulation through minority ownership to justify prophylactic measures. It characterizes the Act as a reasonable preventive response to a demonstrated pattern of large\u2011scale political spending by entities with foreign government owners or affiliates (such as HQUS and Versant) and emphasizes that legislatures may act to prevent anticipated harms to the electoral process without waiting for conclusive proof of undue influence in each case.",
          "Regarding the definition covering entities in which a foreign government \"directs, dictates, controls or directly or indirectly participates\" in political decision\u2011making, Maine stresses that this language was modeled on a federal regulation (11 C.F.R. \u00a7 110.20(i)) implementing FECA\u2019s ban on foreign national involvement in U.S. elections. Maine argues that this alignment with federal policy supports the reasonableness and constitutionality of Maine\u2019s approach. It maintains that the Ethics and Election Commission\u2019s subsequently revised rules have narrowed and clarified what counts as \"participation\" by a foreign government, addressing the district court\u2019s concern that earlier draft rules might have extended the statute to mere \"influence\" or unsolicited communications. Maine argues that, as properly interpreted and implemented, the \"actual participation\" definition targets only situations in which foreign governments are truly involved in an entity\u2019s electoral spending decisions and is thus narrowly tailored.",

It argues that focusing solely on foreign governments and not on the U.S.-based recipients of foreign direction or funding would be ineffective, as enforcement agencies cannot easily reach sovereign actors abroad. According to Maine, regulating U.S. corporations and other domestic entities that serve as conduits for foreign political spending is necessary to make the ban on foreign participation enforceable.",

It maintains that the district court underestimated the constitutional core of the statute and overestimated the extent of its unconstitutional applications. Maine suggests that, at a minimum, the Act can be validly applied to certain categories of entities (for example, those majority or wholly owned by foreign governments) and to certain provisions such as the disclaimer requirement.",
          "Maine further argues that the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction is overly broad because it enjoins enforcement of the Act in its entirety, including provisions Maine views as clearly constitutional, such as the disclaimer requirement for permissible communications (subsection 6) and, in Maine\u2019s view, potentially the due\u2011diligence obligations on media platforms (subsection 7). Maine asserts that the court should have conducted a severability analysis to determine whether discrete applications or provisions could remain in force even if some definitions of \"foreign government\u2011influenced entity\" were problematic. It maintains that Maine severability law makes it straightforward to excise any unconstitutional components while preserving the rest.",

Maine\u2019s concern is that an explicit preemption finding was unnecessary and could have influenced the district court\u2019s broader facial\u2011invalidity analysis.

They contend that the Act is a content\u2011based and speaker\u2011based regulation of political speech that must be subjected to strict scrutiny, particularly insofar as it bans expenditures and independent expenditures, and that it cannot satisfy that standard.",

They emphasize that the Act broadly bans corporations and other entities labeled as \"foreign government\u2011influenced\" from making any election\u2011related contributions, expenditures, independent expenditures, and electioneering communications, and from engaging in other disbursements of funds to influence ballot measures and candidate races. This, they argue, is a comprehensive suppression of political speech subject to strict scrutiny. CMP also maintains that, even if exacting scrutiny is applied to the contribution aspects, the Act fails that standard as well.",
          "The plaintiffs dispute Maine\u2019s characterization of its interests. CMP and Versant argue that Maine\u2019s asserted interests, particularly in limiting the mere appearance of foreign influence or in regulating speech because of a foreign source of information, are not compelling or even sufficiently important under the First Amendment when domestic corporations are the speakers. They emphasize precedent holding that political speech does not lose protection because its source is a corporation, and that the government may not disfavor speech based on the identity of the speaker. They also argue that any governmental interest recognized in cases like Bluman and Citizens United is limited to preventing actual participation in elections by foreign nationals and foreign corporations operating abroad, not regulating American corporations with some degree of foreign ownership.",
          "The plaintiffs contend that the 5% foreign ownership threshold is substantially overbroad and lacks any meaningful nexus to actual foreign control or participation in corporate political decisions. They highlight that CMP and Versant are Maine\u2011incorporated, long\u2011standing, solely Maine\u2011operating utilities run by U.S. citizens, yet are silenced by the Act because of minority stakes held by foreign public entities, such as Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund or the City of Calgary. They note that Maine has produced no evidence that these foreign stakeholders have directed or even attempted to influence the corporations\u2019 political activities in Maine, and that the cited CMP and HQUS expenditures were motivated by the companies\u2019 own business interests in contested energy and utility policies, not by foreign policy goals.",
          "The plaintiffs also argue that the 5% threshold is arbitrary and not a valid proxy for control or influence over corporate speech. They point out that securities\u2011law disclosure thresholds do not equate to control and that the use of the same percentage for disclosure in other regulatory contexts does not establish its constitutional sufficiency for restricting political speech. They further note that analogous state provisions using even lower thresholds have been struck down as unconstitutional, and that the Maine threshold operates to silence the speech of corporations that may be 90\u201395% owned by U.S. citizens.",
          "With respect to the \"actual participation\" definition, the plaintiffs argue that, in practice, Maine\u2019s interpretation (especially as reflected in the Ethics and Election Commission\u2019s earlier proposed rules) risks sweeping in corporations that merely receive information or unsolicited communications from foreign governments, without any genuine foreign control or participation in decision\u2011making. They maintain that this broad interpretation chills domestic corporate speech by creating uncertainty over whether normal business or informational contacts with foreign governments could trigger a loss of political speech rights. They argue that the state\u2019s post\u2011hoc regulatory revisions do not cure the statute\u2019s constitutional defects, particularly given the criminal penalties for \"knowing\" violations.",

They contend that requiring every broadcaster, print outlet, and Internet platform to develop and implement policies \"reasonably designed\" to screen out prohibited communications, under threat of civil penalties and potential criminal consequences if such communications are not caught and removed, imposes an impracticable and chilling compliance burden. They emphasize that media entities often cannot know the precise ownership structure of sponsors or the extent of foreign government involvement, and that the statute provides insufficient guidance on what due diligence is adequate.",
          "The Electors argue that the Act infringes their rights as voters to receive information and viewpoints from all speakers, including corporations with foreign ownership.

They also argue that restricting public debate about issues such as energy policy and utility regulation \u2013 where companies like CMP and Versant have particular expertise and a direct stake \u2013 harms the democratic process.",
          "Collectively, the plaintiffs argue that the Act is facially overbroad. They maintain that a substantial number of the Act\u2019s applications are unconstitutional, including its application to domestic corporations with minimal or passive foreign ownership, its coverage of entities based on vague notions of \"indirect participation\" by foreign governments, and its burdens on media platforms. They argue that any plainly legitimate applications\u2014such as a direct ban on spending by foreign governments themselves\u2014are overwhelmed by the statute\u2019s unconstitutional reach.\n",

They assert that, because the Act\u2019s structure tightly interlinks its core definitions and prohibitions with its enforcement and ancillary provisions, and because the statute\u2019s central definitions are themselves likely unconstitutional, a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Act as a whole is warranted. They further contend that subsections like the disclaimer requirement cannot be cleanly separated from the flawed definitions of \"foreign government\u2011influenced entity\" on which they depend.",
          "On preemption, Versant and others support the district court\u2019s view that FECA expressly preempts state regulation of foreign spending in federal elections. They express concern that, absent a clear preemption holding, the Ethics and Election Commission (now or in the future) might attempt to apply the Act to federal races, compounding its constitutional problems. They also argue that the district court\u2019s First Amendment analysis did not depend on the preemption ruling, because the overbreadth and tailoring problems exist even when the Act is confined to state and local elections."

However, the court is also likely to agree with the district court that an asserted interest in avoiding only the \u2018appearance\u2019 of foreign influence (untethered to actual influence, control, or participation) is too amorphous and inconsistent with precedent that rejects censorship based solely on the identity of a domestic speaker. Thus the district court\u2019s recognition of interests in limiting actual foreign-government participation will be affirmed; its refusal to credit a free\u2011standing \u2018appearance\u2019 interest will also be affirmed. The net result is that Maine gains no material ground on this issue compared to the district court\u2019s framing, so in terms of outcome the district court\u2019s treatment of governmental interests stands."

          "reasoning":"Narrow tailoring in a First Amendment challenge is a legal question reviewed de novo, though underlying historical or predictive judgments can receive some deference. The 5% ownership trigger sweeps in long\u2011standing Maine corporations that are overwhelmingly domestically owned, managed by U.S. citizens, and operating solely in Maine, based solely on comparatively small, indirect stakes by foreign public entities. Maine offered no concrete evidence that such minority governmental ownership has translated into control over, or even attempts to participate in, corporate political spending in Maine. The choice of 5% borrows from securities-disclosure law, but disclosure thresholds are not a constitutional measure of influence sufficient to justify categorical bans on political speech. Given Citizens United\u2019s protection of corporate political expenditures and the absence of a record showing that 5% beneficial ownership is a reliable proxy for foreign government control or participation, the district court reasonably found that this ownership-based definition is substantially overinclusive and not narrowly tailored (even under exacting scrutiny). \n\nFor the \u2018directs, dictates, controls or directly or indirectly participates\u2019 prong, the statutory language mirrors the federal regulation, but the Ethics Commission\u2019s earlier implementing rules\u2014and the breadth of \u2018indirect participation\u2019\u2014create uncertainty about whether mere communications or background influence could suffice. In light of criminal penalties, that vagueness and breadth chill speech by domestic corporations with routine foreign interactions. The state\u2019s post\u2011litigation narrowing through revised rules is not embedded in the statute, and the court was entitled, at the preliminary stage, to credit the chilling effect and likely overbreadth. The appellate court is likely to hold that on the current record Maine has not carried its burden to show that either the 5% threshold or the \u2018participation\u2019 definition, as written, is narrowly tailored\/closely drawn. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s conclusion that these core definitional provisions are likely unconstitutional will be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"Facial overbreadth is reviewed de novo. The statute\u2019s legitimate sweep plainly includes direct spending and direction of spending by foreign governments and entities they truly control in Maine elections. But because the definition of \u2018foreign government\u2011influenced entity\u2019 extends to domestic companies based on minimal or indirect foreign public ownership and uncertain notions of \u2018indirect participation,\u2019 the number of unconstitutional applications\u2014especially to domestic corporations like CMP and Versant and similarly situated entities\u2014is substantial. Those entities are engaged in core political expression about state policy and referenda, yet are silenced on the basis of ownership structure, not proven foreign control or participation. The same broad definition feeds into ancillary prohibitions (solicitation, assistance, structuring) and triggers for media\u2011screening obligations. In relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate applications (foreign governments and plainly controlled entities), the sweep to such domestic speakers is large. At the preliminary stage, the district court reasonably concluded that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on a facial overbreadth claim. Given the breadth of affected speech and the serious chilling effect, the First Circuit is likely to uphold this assessment, at least as to likelihood of success, and thus affirm the district court on the overbreadth issue."

Federal courts are not obliged, especially on an emergency preliminary\u2011injunction motion, to undertake a fine\u2011grained severability surgery, particularly where the challenged definitions permeate the statute and all enforcement provisions depend on them. The district court acted within its discretion in declining to resolve severability definitively on a compressed schedule and in focusing instead on likelihood of success and the risk of chilling speech.\n\nThat said, some provisions\u2014most notably the disclaimer requirement for otherwise lawful public communications by clearly foreign government actors and perhaps some aspects of the due\u2011diligence requirement applied to obviously foreign-government sponsors\u2014are more plausibly constitutional and less directly tied to the problematic 5%\/participation definitions as applied to domestic corporations. The First Circuit often insists that preliminary relief be no broader than necessary to address the likely constitutional violation. On appeal, the panel is likely to hold that the district court should have tailored the injunction more narrowly, for example by allowing enforcement of: (a) the ban on direct spending by foreign governments and entities they majority own or control; and (b) the disclaimer requirement for communications by such plainly foreign speakers, at least as applied to state and local elections. It will therefore likely find that, to the extent the injunction bars enforcement of clearly severable, more modest provisions, the district court exceeded its discretion. The panel will remand with instructions to narrow the injunction accordingly, while maintaining preliminary relief against enforcement of the Act\u2019s challenged core as applied to domestic corporations like CMP and Versant and against the broad media due\u2011diligence regime. Thus, the court will partially affirm the issuance of an injunction but reverse its current breadth."

However, the panel is likely to characterize that outcome as a matter of statutory construction\u2014construing the Maine Act, where fairly possible, as limited to state and local elections to avoid preemption\u2014rather than as an affirmative holding that the Act is preempted on its face. Because all parties effectively agree that the Act may not be enforced in the federal-election context, the First Circuit will likely downplay any independent preemption holding and note that this question does not materially change the First Amendment overbreadth analysis, which is driven by the law\u2019s operation in state and local elections. In effect, the court will affirm the functional result (no application to federal elections) but correct or narrow the district court\u2019s express\u2011preemption framing."

On that basis, the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on their facial overbreadth challenge is upheld. \n\nWhere the panel is more likely to diverge is on remedial scope and framing. The First Circuit often narrows overbroad preliminary injunctions, particularly when a statute has an evident constitutional core (here, direct bans on foreign-government spending and perhaps disclaimers for clearly foreign speakers). It is therefore probable that the court will: (1) affirm the grant of preliminary injunctive relief insofar as it bars enforcement of the challenged provisions against domestic corporations and media\/Internet platforms under the problematic definitions; but (2) remand with instructions to limit the injunction so as not to prevent enforcement of clearly severable and constitutionally sound applications, especially the direct prohibition on foreign-government spending in state and local elections and some disclaimer requirements. The court is also likely to reframe the preemption holding as statutory narrowing to avoid FECA conflict rather than broad federal preemption. Thus the ultimate result is mixed: the core grant of a preliminary injunction stands, but its breadth and some legal characterizations (severability, preemption framing) are partly reversed or modified."

      "factual_background":"Justin and Jared Brackett own and operate two restaurants in the Town of Harwich, Massachusetts: Ember Pizza, Inc. (\"Ember\") and The Port Restaurant and Bar, Inc. (\"The Port\"). The restaurants held liquor licenses and entertainment licenses issued annually or seasonally by the Harwich Board of Selectmen (the \"Board\"). The entertainment licenses allowed amplified or acoustic music indoors and outdoors, but the restaurants remained subject to the Town's Noise Ordinance.\n\nThe Harwich Noise Ordinance makes it unlawful to cause or allow any noise from any building, structure, vehicle, premises, or sound amplification system that is plainly audible at a distance of 150 feet from the source. The Ordinance states that plainly audible noise is prima facie evidence of a violation and defines \"plainly audible\" as sound detectable above normal ambient background noise by unaided human hearing.\n\nIn September 2019, after multiple noise complaints against Ember, Harwich determined there had been a violation of the Noise Ordinance. In October 2019, the Board voted to suspend Ember's entertainment license for two days in its entirety and to restrict it to acoustic-only performances for five additional days. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ember did not serve at least some portion of this suspension. During the intervening period, Ember was accused of additional violations of the Noise Ordinance. On August 3, 2020, the Board rescinded its prior suspensions and instead imposed a seven-day suspension of Ember's entertainment license.\n\nEmber and The Port allege that false noise complaints were lodged against them and that Harwich selectively enforced the Ordinance. They assert that other licensees, including competing restaurants, committed \"open and obvious\" violations of the noise rules but were not subjected to similar discipline.\n\nSeparately, Ember and The Port were cited for violating Massachusetts' pandemic-related COVID-19 restrictions. In 2020, state guidance allowed restaurants to remain open only for takeout food and alcohol sales. On May 28, 2020, the Harwich Police Deputy Chief referred to Town officials several alleged violations of the COVID-19 guidance by Ember and The Port. The plaintiffs allege that these pandemic rules, like the Noise Ordinance, were selectively enforced against them.\n\nIn November 2020, Ember and The Port applied to the Board to renew their entertainment licenses. The Board had already renewed other restaurants' entertainment licenses months earlier. On April 26, 2021, the Board renewed Ember's liquor and entertainment licenses, but imposed an acoustic-only restriction on Ember's entertainment license. The next day, the Board revoked The Port's expanded outdoor dining permit. On May 10, 2021, the Board imposed an acoustic-only restriction on The Port's entertainment license. The Board did not renew The Port's liquor license until May 12, 2021, and at that time it also imposed a three-day suspension of that liquor license as discipline for alleged COVID-19 violations.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that town officials and certain private individuals undertook a malicious and orchestrated campaign to selectively target and retaliate against Ember and The Port by fabricating or exaggerating violations of the noise ordinance and COVID-19 restrictions, delaying license renewals, and imposing one-sided sanctions while competitors were allegedly not disciplined. Plaintiffs further allege that two private individuals, Gail O. Sluis and Patricia A. O'Neill, made or instigated complaints to town officials and agencies, engaged in ex parte communications with town officials, and received internal non-public town memoranda and information. They claim that these individuals falsely reported that Ember and The Port were violating their licenses and COVID-19 regulations, including reports supposedly made while O'Neill was in Florida.\n\nThe plaintiffs also allege that former Board Chair Michael D. MacAskill made veiled threats to them, including statements such as \"kiss the ring\" and \"good luck,\" and that on another occasion he and owner Jared Brackett \"exchanged words\" and MacAskill had to be restrained from physically attacking Brackett. Plaintiffs assert that the Board subjected them to a series of untimely, costly, protracted, and non-statutory public hearings about their licenses during which their counsel was allegedly muted and could not meaningfully cross-examine witnesses. They further allege that Board member and Chairman Larry Ballantine made public statements to the Cape Cod Times characterizing their alleged COVID-19 violations as very flagrant and asserting that they ignored COVID-19 regulations.\n\nIn response to the Town's actions, Ember and The Port filed multiple lawsuits in Massachusetts state court and pursued an appeal to the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC) under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, \u00a7 67, challenging the Town's licensing decisions.",

        "claims_brought":"On March 19, 2021, Ember and The Port (together with related entities 3137, LLC and 541 Main Street Realty Trust, and owners Justin and Jared Brackett) filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Town of Harwich, members of the Board of Selectmen in their individual capacities (including Larry G. Ballantine, Donald F. Howell, Michael D. MacAskill, Edward J. McManus, and Stephen P. Ford), other Harwich officials in their individual capacities, and two private individuals, Gail O. Sluis and Patricia A. O'Neill. They later filed an amended complaint, which is the operative pleading for the appeal. The complaint also named \"John and\/or Jane Does 1\u201310\" as unidentified alleged co-conspirators.\n\nThe amended complaint alleged six counts: (1) a federal civil rights conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 against defendants in their official capacities, asserting a conspiracy to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional rights; (2) a claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 11I, against defendants in their individual capacities, asserting denial of due process through the application of vague and unclear standards; and (3)\u2013(6) various Massachusetts common law and state law claims, including civil conspiracy and defamation claims and state constitutional claims under Articles 12 and 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The \u00a7 1983 claims included alleged violations of the First Amendment (overbreadth\/vagueness challenges to the noise ordinance and alleged retaliation) and Fourteenth Amendment (substantive due process, procedural due process, and equal protection), and plaintiffs at points also referred to a Fifth Amendment \"facial taking.\"",
        "district_court_decision":"On September 29 and 30, 2021, the Harwich defendants and Sluis moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On January 28, 2022, the district court granted those motions, dismissing the claims against the Harwich defendants and Sluis, and also dismissing the claims against the John\/Jane Doe defendants on the ground that the complaint did not show a good-faith investigation to identify them.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, Harwich and Sluis moved for separate and final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). On March 31, 2022, O'Neill filed a notice of intent to move for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c). On April 11, 2022, Ember and The Port cross-moved for relief from the January 28 order and sought leave to file another amended complaint. On April 15, 2022, O'Neill filed her Rule 12(c) motion, and plaintiffs again cross-moved for leave to amend.\n\nOn July 22, 2022, the district court denied the Harwich defendants' and Sluis's motion for separate and final judgment, and also denied the plaintiffs' first cross-motion for relief from the dismissal order and for leave to amend. On March 15, 2023, the district court granted O'Neill's motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), denied plaintiffs' second cross-motion for leave to amend as futile, and rejected the operative complaint in its entirety, disposing of all remaining claims.\n\nThroughout its rulings, the district court concluded, among other things, that: (a) the complaint failed to state viable federal constitutional claims under \u00a7 1983 (including First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process, and equal protection theories), and plaintiffs' references to a \u00a7 1985 conspiracy and a Fifth Amendment taking were not adequately pleaded or developed; (b) the private defendants Sluis and O'Neill had not been adequately alleged to be state actors for \u00a7 1983 purposes; (c) the MCRA claim failed because the allegations did not amount to threats, intimidation, or coercion interfering with secured rights; (d) the common law civil conspiracy claim failed because the complaint did not adequately plead either of the two recognized Massachusetts conspiracy theories; and (e) the defamation claims failed because the complaint did not adequately identify specific false statements as to Sluis or O'Neill, and because Ballantine's statement fell within a conditionally privileged context the plaintiffs had not overcome. The district court further concluded that an additional amendment would be futile because plaintiffs had not specified additional facts that would cure these deficiencies.",

They characterize the dispute as a routine, albeit contentious, local licensing matter that does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.",

On procedural due process, they assert that Massachusetts law provides ample predeprivation and postdeprivation processes for licensees, including statutory judicial review under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 249, \u00a7 4, and appeals to the ABCC under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138, \u00a7 67, which plaintiffs in fact utilized.

They maintain that reporting complaints to authorities or engaging in communications with town officials does not constitute exercising powers traditionally and exclusively reserved to the state, nor does it amount to joint action or state compulsion. They note that the complaint alleges, at most, that Sluis and O'Neill made complaints and received non-public information, which they argue is insufficient to transform them into state actors.",

They point out that plaintiffs abandoned their facial and as-applied First Amendment challenges to the Noise Ordinance in their appellate briefing and at oral argument. They also note that plaintiffs did not plead or argue a First Amendment retaliation claim in the district court in a developed way and therefore cannot raise it for the first time on appeal. Similarly, they argue that the \u00a7 1985 conspiracy and Fifth Amendment 'facial taking' theories were only mentioned perfunctorily and are waived.",

As to Ballantine, they argue that his statement to the Cape Cod Times was conditionally privileged because he was speaking in his capacity as a public official about enforcement of public health regulations, a matter of public concern.

First Circuit precedent is extremely reluctant to constitutionalize local land\u2011use\/licensing fights; selective enforcement against one or a few businesses, even if motivated by animus, generally does not amount to conscience\u2011shocking or legally irrational conduct, nor to an equal protection violation absent a well\u2011pleaded class\u2011of\u2011one theory with specific comparators, which is not clearly and concretely alleged here. For procedural due process, Massachusetts affords pre\u2011 and post\u2011deprivation remedies, including statutory review and ABCC appeals, which plaintiffs in fact pursued; under Parratt\u2011Hudson, alleged deviations from state procedures during hearings do not make out a federal due process claim where adequate state remedies exist. As to the private parties, the allegations amount to citizens complaining to and communicating with officials and receiving inside information; under First Circuit law this does not satisfy the public function, joint action, or state compulsion tests. Plaintiffs\u2019 general assertions that Sluis and O\u2019Neill \u2018directed\u2019 or \u2018instigated\u2019 enforcement are conclusory and insufficient to convert them into state actors.

Here, the alleged remarks (\u2018kiss the ring,\u2019 \u2018good luck\u2019) and one heated confrontation that was defused, combined with regulatory actions taken through formal processes, are unlikely to be viewed as the sort of threats or coercion MCRA requires, especially where plaintiffs continued operating and actively litigated rather than being intimidated into foregoing rights.

For the \u2018peculiar power of coercion\u2019 form, Massachusetts decisions require that defendants\u2019 concerted action give them a special coercive leverage they would not possess individually. Here, the Town officials were simply exercising their collective authority as a multi\u2011member licensing board; that is the exact structure by which their statutory power is supposed to be exercised and does not constitute a peculiar power beyond their usual roles.

Under settled circuit doctrine, such allegations seldom clear the high bars for substantive or procedural due process, equal protection, MCRA, or Massachusetts conspiracy, particularly where robust state\u2011law review mechanisms are available and used. The private defendants\u2019 conduct\u2014complaining to authorities and communicating with officials\u2014does not make them state actors.

Romanova licensed National Geographic Magazine to publish this Photograph on a single-use basis in an article titled \"Intimate Photos of People and Their Beloved Pet Snakes,\" which was published on September 29, 2017. On October 3, 2017, Romanova registered the Photograph with the United States Copyright Office.\n\nAmilus Inc. is the registered owner of the website www.ai-ap.com (the \"Website\"). On December 31, 2017, Amilus copied Romanova's Photograph from the National Geographic article and republished it on the Website in an article titled \"Trending: Dogs, Cats . . . and Other Pets, to Start Off 2018.\" The Website is accessible only to subscribers who pay a monthly membership fee of about $5, and the Website also sells merchandise to the public. The Amilus article featured ten photographs of people with pets, each apparently copied from other publications, as part of what the site described as a \"semi-regular series focusing on the ever-increasing amount of pet photography we find online.\" The article added that it included \"some pet snakes thrown in for good measure.\" The Website's caption for Romanova's Photograph was \"Intimate Photos of People and Their Beloved Pet Snakes,\" the same title as the original National Geographic article. Romanova's Photograph was the only image in the Amilus article featuring snakes.\n\nRomanova discovered the Photograph on Amilus's Website on December 26, 2019, approximately two years after it had first been posted there.

According to a letter from Romanova's counsel, a corporate officer of Amilus confirmed receipt of the Clerk's Certificate of Default and the Order to Show Cause and stated that Amilus would not participate in the proceedings. The district court held a hearing on the motion for default judgment. Instead of granting the motion, the court sua sponte ordered Romanova to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed on the ground that Amilus's use of the Photograph constituted fair use. Romanova filed a memorandum and declaration in response.

          "reasoning":"Review of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal and of the application of the fair-use factors on the pleadings is de novo. The complaint adequately pleads a prima facie infringement claim: ownership of a registered copyright and unauthorized copying\/display of the Photograph. Fair use is an affirmative defense on which the defendant bears the burden. On the face of the complaint and incorporated materials, fair use is not so clearly established that it can defeat the claim at the pleading stage, particularly where the defendant has defaulted and offered no evidence.\n\nApplying the \u00a7 107 factors under the proper standard and in the posture of a motion to dismiss:\n(1) Purpose and character: The use is commercial (behind a paid subscription wall on a site that also sells merchandise). The Photograph is republished in full as an illustrative image in another pet\u2011photography article, serving essentially the same illustrative purpose as the National Geographic use. The added surrounding text about a trend in pet photography does not comment on, criticize, or meaningfully transform the Photograph itself; it simply aggregates and showcases images. Under recent Supreme Court and Second Circuit guidance, a change in context or audience alone is not enough to be transformative when the secondary use shares the same purpose and provides a substitute illustration. This factor at a minimum does not clearly favor fair use at the pleading stage and plausibly favors Romanova.\n(2) Nature of the work: The Photograph is a creative, artistic work, traditionally at the core of copyright protection. This weighs against fair use, or at least does not support dismissal on the pleadings.\n(3) Amount and substantiality: Amilus copied the entire Photograph. Full reproduction of a creative work weighs against fair use absent a strong justification, which is not apparent on the face of the complaint and cannot be assumed in favor of a defaulting defendant.\n(4) Market effect: Romanova alleges she earns primary income from licensing her images for online and print use, and that Amilus provided a substitute, unlicensed publication of the same Photograph on a paywalled site. At the pleading stage, the court must assume and reasonably infer a potential harm to the licensing market. The district court instead drew inferences against her and in favor of a fair-use defense, contrary to the Rule 12(b)(6) standard.\n\nBecause at least several factors plausibly favor the copyright holder and because the defendant bears (and has not carried) the burden of establishing fair use, the defense is not apparent as a matter of law on the face of the complaint. The district court therefore erred in using fair use to dismiss for failure to state a claim. That dismissal must be reversed."

Fair use is an affirmative defense that must be raised and proven by the defendant. Under the party\u2011presentation principle and civil\u2011procedure norms, courts generally do not sua sponte interpose unpleaded affirmative defenses, particularly where doing so alters the allocation of burdens and deprives the plaintiff of the benefit of the adversarial process.\n\nHere, Amilus not only failed to plead fair use, it defaulted and expressly declined to participate. The district court nonetheless:\n(1) raised fair use on its own initiative after the Clerk\u2019s entry of default,\n(2) effectively converted the matter into a Rule 12(b)(6) analysis without a motion by the defendant,\n(3) put the burden on Romanova to \u2018show cause\u2019 why fair use did not apply, and\n(4) dismissed with prejudice based on its own view that the affirmative defense was clearly established.\n\nThis procedure both misallocated the burden of proof and contravened the principle that the plaintiff need not anticipate and negate affirmative defenses in the complaint. In the default context, the court may (and must) assess whether the well\u2011pleaded allegations establish a prima facie claim; here they do. But it may not manufacture and adjudicate an unasserted affirmative defense against the plaintiff, especially while drawing inferences against her. That constitutes legal error. The appropriate course is to accept liability as established by default (subject to the sufficiency of the complaint) and proceed to damages and any equitable relief, absent a properly raised defense. Thus, the judgment must be reversed on this procedural ground as well."

De novo application of both Rule 12(b)(6) standards and the fair\u2011use doctrine strongly suggests reversal. Substantively, the alleged use is commercial, reproduces the entire creative Photograph, serves a similar illustrative purpose, and plausibly harms the licensing market; fair use is not clearly established as a matter of law on the complaint alone, and the burden rests on the absent defendant. Procedurally, raising and deciding an unasserted affirmative defense against a non\u2011appearing party, and then requiring the plaintiff to negate that defense, conflicts with basic civil\u2011procedure principles and the allocation of burdens for fair use. Appellate courts in analogous cases have reversed such dismissals and remanded for further proceedings, typically directing the district court to enter default judgment as to liability and then address damages and any other relief. Accordingly, the prediction is that the appellate court reverses the dismissal on both issues and remands for entry of default judgment on liability and a determination of damages and remedies."

      "factual_background":"In 2012, Anna Gristina, who ran what was described as a high-end prostitution operation, was prosecuted in New York State court. On September 25, 2012, she pleaded guilty to one count of promoting prostitution in the third degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 230.25(1). Justice Juan Merchan presided over the criminal case and sentenced her to six months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 probation. Gristina did not appeal her conviction.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Gristina sought to obtain transcripts from proceedings in that criminal case in order, according to her later filings, to assist efforts to challenge or vacate her conviction on the ground that her guilty plea was coerced. On January 14, 2021, she filed a motion before Justice Merchan requesting unsealing of four transcripts and any related documents from her criminal case. In a short brief, she asserted that, under the Sixth Amendment and the New York due process clause, she had a right to view or copy any court document or record in order to put on a defense, take legal action concerning her case, or consult counsel about prospective legal matters. The New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office opposed the motion.\n\nOn March 12, 2021, she supplemented her motion to request unsealing of an additional transcript as well as unredacted copies of a search warrant, search warrant affidavit, and related minutes. In total she was then seeking five transcripts plus related materials.\n\nOn March 22, 2021, Justice Merchan issued an order addressing the unsealing requests. The court noted that one requested transcript was not sealed, and another appeared to have been sealed in error and would be reviewed in camera. Three transcripts remained at issue: (1) a September 25, 2012 transcript, (2) an August 13, 2012 transcript, and (3) an August 16, 2012 transcript. As to the September 25 transcript, the court explained that it had been transcribed by a court reporter no longer employed by the Office of Court Administration, that it had been ordered from storage, and that the supervising court reporter would determine whether it was in fact sealed once retrieved.\n\nThe August 13 and August 16 transcripts related to proceedings in which Gristina was not directly participating in open court. The August 13 transcript involved only her co\u2011defendant, and Gristina was not present. The sealed August 16 transcript concerned an ex parte matter. Another August 16 transcript from a calendar call at which Gristina appeared and certain pretrial matters were discussed had already been unsealed.\n\nDue to a clerical error, the court reporter had already provided Gristina with copies of the sealed August 13 and August 16 transcripts. Justice Merchan\u2019s order stated that the court has inherent power in rare instances to seal its records and, in still rarer cases, to unseal them. The court concluded that Gristina had not met her burden to show why the sealed minutes of August 13 and 16 should be unsealed and that she had not justified retaining the copies she had received by mistake. The court ordered that the August 13 and 16 transcripts remain sealed and directed Gristina to return the erroneously released copies.\n\nGristina\u2019s later filings asserted that she wanted the transcripts, among other reasons, to support a motion to vacate her conviction by showing that her guilty plea had been coerced.",

        "claims_brought":"After Justice Merchan\u2019s March 22, 2021 order, Gristina first sought relief in state court. On June 7, 2021, she filed an Article 78 petition in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, seeking a writ of prohibition or mandamus compelling unsealing of the August 13, August 16, and September 25 transcripts in her criminal case. The petition named Justice Merchan and then\u2011District Attorney Cyrus Vance, among others, as defendants, and asserted federal due process and equal protection violations arising from the opposition to and denial of her unsealing motion.\n\nSeparately, on October 20, 2021, Gristina filed a federal civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the Southern District of New York. The federal complaint again named Justice Merchan and DA Vance (later automatically substituted with DA Alvin Bragg under Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d)) in their official capacities. She alleged that the District Attorney\u2019s opposition to her unsealing motion and Justice Merchan\u2019s denial of that motion violated her federal constitutional rights, including due process and equal protection. She sought injunctive relief directing defendants to allow her to pay for and obtain unsealed copies of the specified court minutes, and declaratory relief stating that she is entitled to those unsealed minutes.",

It later denied Gristina\u2019s motion for leave to appeal on January 11, 2022. The New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal on June 16, 2022.\n\nIn the federal action, Justice Merchan and the District Attorney moved to dismiss on multiple grounds: (1) lack of subject\u2011matter jurisdiction under the Younger abstention doctrine; (2) lack of jurisdiction under the Rooker\u2011Feldman doctrine; and (3) failure to state a claim based on judicial and prosecutorial immunity. On May 19, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Paul A. Crotty) dismissed Gristina\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint without prejudice. The court held that it was required to abstain under Younger because, when the federal suit was filed, the Article 78 proceeding was still pending on appeal in state court and involved the quintessentially judicial function of deciding whether to seal or unseal court records. In the alternative, the court concluded that the Rooker\u2011Feldman doctrine barred review because the state trial court\u2019s order denying unsealing constituted a final state court judgment that the federal suit effectively invited the district court to review and reject.",

She also challenges the district court\u2019s alternative reliance on the Rooker\u2011Feldman doctrine and its characterization of the state court\u2019s denial of unsealing as a final judgment that deprived the federal court of jurisdiction."

          "Even if the Article 78 proceeding was considered pending when she filed her federal suit, any Younger\u2011based concern dissipated once the state appellate process concluded. Because Younger is an equitable, prudential doctrine aimed at preventing interference with ongoing state processes, it no longer justified abstention by the time the district court ruled and certainly not by the time of appeal.",

          "The Rooker\u2013Feldman doctrine does not bar her suit because, at the time she filed in federal court, her state appeal from the Article 78 dismissal was still pending, so the state proceedings had not \"ended\" for Rooker\u2013Feldman purposes. Moreover, her alleged injury\u2014the inability to obtain the transcripts\u2014was not caused by the state Article 78 judgment itself but by the continued sealing of records, a situation predating and existing independently of that judgment.",

          "At the time Gristina filed her federal complaint, her Article 78 petition seeking to compel unsealing remained under review in the state appellate courts; thus, there was an ongoing state civil proceeding addressing the same subject matter. Under Second Circuit precedent, the existence of such a pending proceeding at the time of federal filing is sufficient to trigger Younger analysis.",
          "The sealing and unsealing of court records is an inherent and fundamental aspect of a state court\u2019s authority to manage its own proceedings and records, including protecting the integrity of criminal proceedings, safeguarding victims and witnesses, and balancing rights of public access against fair trial and confidentiality concerns. The Article 78 proceeding therefore fit within Younger\u2019s third category as a civil proceeding uniquely in furtherance of the state court\u2019s ability to perform its judicial functions.",
          "Federal intervention ordering the unsealing of transcripts while the state courts were still considering Gristina\u2019s unsealing request would create impermissible friction and duplication between the federal and state systems, effectively turning the federal court into an appellate tribunal second\u2011guessing state court management of its own records and procedures.",

This undermines any claim that recourse to federal court is necessary to vindicate her federal rights.",

The Article 78 proceeding directly challenged a state judge\u2019s decision on whether to maintain or lift the sealing of judicial records in a concluded criminal case, and sought a writ compelling the judge to unseal those records. As in Falco (orders regarding attorney\u2019s fees in matrimonial proceedings) and Cavanaugh (family\u2011court child-support mechanisms), this proceeding implicates core judicial functions: control of court files and confidentiality of proceedings. Pennzoil and NOPSI describe this category as covering state processes used to administer and enforce court orders and judgments. A petition that asks an appellate court to command a trial judge to unseal specified transcripts is precisely about how the state judiciary manages and enforces its own orders concerning its records. Thus, the Article 78 proceeding is a \u2018civil proceeding uniquely in furtherance of the state courts\u2019 ability to perform their judicial functions,\u2019 and Younger\u2019s third category is satisfied.

The fact that the Article 78 appeal later concluded does not retroactively eliminate the basis for Younger abstention that existed when the district court addressed the case; Younger is concerned with avoiding interference at the time federal jurisdiction is invoked. Nor did the subsequent completion of the state appellate process mean that the district court was obligated to resurrect a case that was already properly dismissed on abstention grounds. At most, termination of the state case might support lifting a Younger stay in a stayed action, but here dismissal without prejudice on Younger grounds was not error.

One of its requirements is that the state-court judgment precede the federal filing and that the state proceedings have \u2018ended\u2019 before the federal suit begins. At the time Gristina filed her federal complaint (October 20, 2021), her Article 78 case was still pending in the Appellate Division; leave applications were later pursued. Under Exxon Mobil and the Second Circuit\u2019s clarification in Hunter v. McMahon, state proceedings are not \u2018ended\u2019 while an appeal remains pending. Thus, the fourth Hoblock requirement was not met, and Rooker\u2013Feldman did not apply. To the extent the district court deemed the sealing order a \u2018final judgment\u2019 for Rooker\u2013Feldman purposes notwithstanding the live Article 78 appeal, that was legal error. Moreover, Gristina\u2019s alleged injury\u2014the ongoing sealing and the refusal to give her transcripts\u2014flows from the continuing effect of state orders and policies, not exclusively from the Article 78 dismissal itself. Her claims might be precluded or barred for other reasons (including Younger, immunity, or preclusion), but Rooker\u2013Feldman does not strip jurisdiction. The district court\u2019s alternative reliance on Rooker\u2013Feldman is therefore reversed."

      "reasoning":"The district court dismissed on two independent bases: Younger abstention and, in the alternative, Rooker\u2013Feldman. The record squarely fits within the third Younger category as described in Sprint, Pennzoil, Falco, and Cavanaugh. When Gristina filed her federal \u00a7 1983 action, an Article 78 proceeding seeking the same unsealing relief against the same state actors was actively pending on appeal. That proceeding revolved around the state court\u2019s control of its own records\u2014an archetypal judicial function\u2014and provided an adequate forum for her federal claims. Under Second Circuit practice, pendency is assessed at filing, and the later conclusion of the Article 78 case does not retroactively vitiate Younger\u2019s applicability. Therefore, affirmance of the Younger-based dismissal is strongly supported.\n\nBy contrast, the alternative Rooker\u2013Feldman ruling is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s narrowing of that doctrine in Exxon Mobil and the Second Circuit\u2019s focus on whether state proceedings have \u2018ended\u2019 (Hunter, Hoblock). Gristina\u2019s state proceedings were ongoing when she filed in federal court, so the core Rooker\u2013Feldman requirement of a prior final state judgment was not met. The federal suit may resemble a collateral attack on the state orders and may indeed be barred on Younger or preclusion grounds, but it is not jurisdictionally barred by Rooker\u2013Feldman. Accordingly, the likely appellate disposition is to affirm dismissal under Younger while rejecting Rooker\u2013Feldman as an alternative jurisdictional ground, producing a mixed outcome that leaves the case dismissed but clarifies the inapplicability of Rooker\u2013Feldman."

      },
      "factual_background":"Angel Tudor has worked for Whitehall Central School District for approximately twenty years, initially as a substitute teacher and later as a high school math teacher. Tudor has long suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arising from sexual harassment and sexual assault by a supervisor at a prior workplace. Her PTSD symptoms have affected her neurological functioning, interfered with daily tasks, induced a stutter that impedes communication, and caused severe nightmares that at times led her to wake up vomiting. Tudor takes multiple medications to manage these symptoms and has been admitted for psychiatric care related to PTSD on three occasions.\n\nAround 2008, Tudor\u2019s PTSD symptoms escalated beyond what she could manage with therapy and medication alone. In consultation with her therapist, she requested and received an accommodation from Whitehall that allowed her to leave campus for one fifteen\u2011minute break during each of her morning and afternoon prep periods, times when she did not have responsibility for supervising students. She used these breaks to compose herself away from the school environment, which tended to trigger her PTSD symptoms.\n\nIn 2016, following a change in school administration, Whitehall adopted a policy prohibiting teachers from leaving school grounds during prep periods. When Tudor attempted to continue taking off\u2011campus breaks during those times, she was reprimanded for insubordination. She informed the new administration of her longstanding accommodation, but administrators told her that the documentation on file was insufficient to establish a right to a reasonable accommodation. Rather than immediately provide further documentation, Tudor took paid sick leave and then requested leave for the fall semester under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Her physician described her condition as \"PTSD with severe anxiety and agitation.\" During the FMLA leave, Tudor was unable to teach and attended an intensive outpatient treatment program five days a week to get her PTSD symptoms and anxiety under control.\n\nWhen Tudor returned from FMLA leave in January 2017, Whitehall agreed to provide her one of the requested off\u2011campus breaks in the morning and an afternoon break on days when the school librarian could supervise her students. On days when a librarian was unavailable, Tudor could not take an afternoon break. This arrangement continued through the 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319 school years. Whether this arrangement complied with the ADA was litigated in a separate lawsuit.\n\nThe present suit focuses on Tudor\u2019s schedule for the 2019\u201320 school year. That schedule assigned her a morning prep period and an afternoon study hall. During that year, neither the school librarian nor any other Whitehall employee was available to cover Tudor\u2019s class for a fifteen\u2011minute period during afternoon study hall. Despite this, Tudor left school grounds for a break during the study hall period on 91 of the first 100 school days before classes went remote because of the COVID\u201119 pandemic. No Whitehall administrator expressly authorized these afternoon breaks, and it is unclear whether administrators were aware that she was taking them. Tudor testified that because she believed she was violating school policy by leaving, taking the breaks actually increased her anxiety.\n\nTudor claims that the school district\u2019s refusal to guarantee her a daily fifteen\u2011minute afternoon off\u2011campus break during the 2019\u201320 school year exacerbated her PTSD\u2011related pain and anxiety, even though she continued to perform her teaching duties.

          "reasoning":"The question is purely legal: whether a plaintiff\u2019s conceded ability to perform essential job functions without the requested accommodation automatically defeats the third element of an ADA failure\u2011to\u2011accommodate claim at summary judgment. That is reviewed de novo.\n\nThe ADA defines a qualified individual as one who can perform the essential functions of the position \"with or without reasonable accommodation.\" That text does not require that an employee be unable to perform essential functions absent accommodation; it requires only that the employee be capable of performing them, whether with or without such accommodation. The formulation used in Woolf and Natofsky focuses the third element on whether the plaintiff is qualified\u2014i.e., can perform essential functions with or without accommodation\u2014not on whether the employee can perform those functions only with an accommodation.\n\nA contrary rule would read the phrase \"with or without\" out of the statute and would effectively deny accommodation to the exact group of working disabled individuals the statute is designed to protect\u2014those who can perform their jobs but require reasonable accommodations to mitigate disability\u2011related limitations or pain, or to enjoy the terms and conditions of employment on an equal basis. Other circuits have recognized that an employee\u2019s ability to work through significant pain or distress does not categorically bar an accommodation claim, particularly where the requested accommodation is a form of modified schedule or brief break, which the statute expressly contemplates.\n\nHere, the district court assumed, for purposes of summary judgment, that Tudor was disabled and that the District denied the requested accommodation, but held that because she admitted she could perform the essential functions without the accommodation (albeit under \"great duress and harm\"), she necessarily failed the third element. That reasoning transforms the third element into a requirement that the plaintiff prove she is incapable of performing the job without an accommodation, which conflicts with the statutory language and the Second Circuit\u2019s own articulation of the prima facie elements.\n\nOn this record, Tudor\u2019s admission establishes that she is a \"qualified individual\" under the ADA; it does not defeat her status as such. The dispute over whether the fifteen\u2011minute afternoon off\u2011campus break was a reasonable accommodation and whether its denial violated the ADA goes to the fourth element and to issues of necessity and reasonableness, which the district court did not fully analyze under the proper legal framework. Because the court granted summary judgment based on an erroneous legal premise about the third element, that judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for application of the correct standard (including any further consideration of reasonableness, necessity, or undue hardship)."

The plaintiff\u2019s concession that she can do the work without the accommodation confirms that she is qualified; it does not extinguish her entitlement to seek a reasonable accommodation to address disability\u2011related limitations and to work without severe distress. The district court therefore applied an incorrect legal standard at summary judgment. Under de novo review, that legal error warrants reversal and remand for further proceedings under the correct framework, rather than affirmance based on Tudor\u2019s admission alone."

      "factual_background":"In 2016, Congress enacted Public Law No. 114-216, amending the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to add a national bioengineered food disclosure program. The new subtitle E of the Act, codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1639\u20131639j, requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a \"national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard\" within two years. The Act generally preempts state and local requirements regarding labeling of genetically engineered or genetically modified foods, while preserving state and federal remedies and certain other statutory schemes (such as the Organic Foods Production Act). The statute defines \"bioengineering\" with respect to a food as referring to a food that (1) \"contains genetic material that has been modified through in vitro recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques\" and (2) the modification \"could not otherwise be obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature.\" The term \"bioengineering\" is also defined to encompass \"any similar term, as determined by the Secretary.\" The statute directs that the disclosure standard apply to \"any bioengineered food and any food that may be bioengineered\" and to foods subject to certain existing federal food labeling requirements, including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It also directs the Secretary to: (a) determine the amounts of a bioengineered substance that may be present in a food, as appropriate, in order for the food to be considered bioengineered for purposes of the standard; (b) establish a process for determining other factors and conditions under which a food is considered bioengineered; (c) ensure that \"food derived from an animal\" is not considered bioengineered solely because the animal consumed bioengineered feed; (d) provide alternative disclosure methods for small manufacturers and small or very small packages; and (e) exempt food served in restaurants or similar retail food establishments and food from very small manufacturers. Subtitle F contains preemption provisions stating that no state or political subdivision may establish or continue in effect any requirement relating to labeling of whether a food is genetically engineered or produced with genetic engineering, and separately barring non-identical state or local standards relating to whether a food is bioengineered or developed or produced with bioengineering.\n\nThe Act sets out specific rules for the permitted forms of disclosure. The Secretary must require that the form of a food disclosure be either text, symbol, or electronic or digital link, with the particular option chosen by the manufacturer. For the electronic or digital link option, the Act requires: an on-package statement such as \"Scan here for more food information\" or equivalent language reflecting technological changes; and a telephone number that provides access to the bioengineering disclosure. Congress also required the Secretary to conduct a study to identify technological challenges affecting consumer access to disclosures via electronic or digital means (such as QR codes). If, based on that study, the Secretary determines that consumers would not have sufficient access to the bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital methods while shopping, the Secretary, after consulting with food retailers and manufacturers, must \"provide additional and comparable options to access the bioengineering disclosure.\"\n\nFor enforcement, the statute makes it a prohibited act to knowingly fail to make a required disclosure, authorizes recordkeeping requirements and agency examinations or audits, and expressly states that the Secretary has no authority to recall food based solely on whether it bears a bioengineered disclosure.\n\nThe Secretary delegated responsibility for establishing and administering the national disclosure standard to the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS first solicited public input via a series of questions posted online, then issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in May 2018. It received approximately 14,000 comments and issued a final rule in December 2018 titled \"National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard,\" codified at 7 C.F.R. part 66. The disclosure requirements became fully mandatory as of January 1, 2022.\n\nThree aspects of the final regulations are central to the dispute:\n\n1. Treatment of highly refined foods made from bioengineered ingredients. AMS sought to define how the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements applied to refined foods derived from bioengineered crops or ingredients. In the proposed rule, AMS presented two interpretive positions: Position 1 stated that refined products do not \"contain genetic material\" modified through in vitro recombinant DNA techniques because refining renders genetic material undetectable by common testing methods; Position 2 stated that all foods produced from bioengineering, including refined products, fall within the scope of \"bioengineered\" foods. In the final rule, AMS adopted Position 1 with modifications. In 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.1, AMS defined \"bioengineered food\" in language closely tracking the statute but added a proviso that such a food \"does not contain modified genetic material if the genetic material is not detectable pursuant to \u00a7 66.9.\" Section 66.9 then specifies how regulated entities may demonstrate non-detectability: (a) the food is sourced from a non-bioengineered crop or source; (b) the food has been subjected to a refinement process validated to make modified genetic material undetectable; or (c) appropriate testing or analysis confirms absence of modified genetic material. Regulated entities relying on non-detectability must maintain records to support their claims. Under this framework, many highly refined foods made from bioengineered ingredients are treated as outside the definition of \"bioengineered food\"\u2014and thus outside the disclosure requirement\u2014if the genetic material is non-detectable under the regulatory standards.\n\n2. Choice of disclosure terminology. The regulations require that all mandatory disclosures, regardless of format (text, symbol, electronic\/digital link, or text message), use the statutory term \"bioengineered.\" See 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 66.102\u201366.108. AMS declined to require or allow other terms\u2014such as \"genetically engineered,\" \"genetically modified organism,\" or \"GMO\"\u2014to satisfy the disclosure obligation, although manufacturers remain free to include such additional terms on labels so long as they comply with other applicable laws. AMS explained that it was selecting \"bioengineered\" because that is the term used by Congress; AMS viewed it as clearly and accurately describing the technology being disclosed, capable of providing consumers the information they desire, and conducive to disclosure consistency and minimized marketplace confusion. AMS also expressed concern that using other terms could create inconsistencies with the statutory preemption provisions or muddy the scope of the disclosure standard.\n\n3. Electronic\/digital link and text-message disclosure options. In response to the statutory requirement to study potential technological challenges to consumer access via electronic or digital links, the Secretary commissioned a Deloitte Consulting LLP study. After reviewing that study and public comments, AMS concluded that consumers, under ordinary shopping conditions at that time, would not have sufficient access to bioengineering disclosures through electronic or digital link methods alone. Under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(c)(4), this determination triggered an obligation to \"provide additional and comparable options\" to access the disclosure. AMS decided to retain the electronic or digital link (e.g., QR code) option, which it viewed as mandated by the statute, and in addition to the statutory text and symbol options, it adopted a new, fourth option: a stand-alone text-message disclosure method. Section 66.106 governs use of the electronic\/digital link option, requiring a QR code or similar link with the on-package statement \"Scan here for more food information\" and a telephone number with the statement \"Call [1-000-000-000] for more food information\" that provides the bioengineered food disclosure at all times. Section 66.108 establishes the text-message option, under which the label must instruct consumers to \"Text [command word] to [number] for bioengineered food information.\" AMS took the position that it lacked authority to eliminate the electronic\/digital link option, despite the study\u2019s findings, and that the addition of the text-message option satisfied the statutory requirement to provide additional, comparable means of access.\n\nThe plaintiffs are a group of natural foods retailers and public interest or advocacy organizations focused on food labeling, organic standards, and GMO transparency. Natural Grocers operates 162 grocery stores in 20 states and has a business policy, based on founding principles and customer demand, of avoiding the sale of genetically engineered products, which it understands to include highly refined foods derived from bioengineered ingredients. The Center for Food Safety (CFS) is a nonprofit organization whose mission includes promoting clear and accessible labeling of genetically engineered foods. CFS members and supporters, as described in declarations, report that they seek to avoid genetically engineered foods, are familiar with and rely on terms such as \"GMO\" and \"genetically engineered,\" and view the newer statutory term \"bioengineered\" as confusing, unfamiliar, or less informative. Several CFS members described practical obstacles to using QR codes or text-message systems in grocery aisles, such as limited smartphone access, data costs, time constraints, or usability barriers, and expressed a preference for clear on-package text or symbols. The plaintiffs allege that the challenged regulatory provisions frustrate their organizational purposes, impose additional costs on retailers attempting to avoid GMOs without the benefit of full federal disclosure coverage (e.g., for refined foods), and reduce their and their members\u2019 ability to obtain clear and immediate information about whether foods are bioengineered or derived from bioengineered ingredients.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In July 2020, Natural Grocers, Citizens for GMO Labeling, Label GMOs, Rural Vermont, Good Earth Natural Foods, Puget Consumers Co-op, National Organic Coalition, and Center for Food Safety filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the United States Department of Agriculture, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (collectively referred to in the opinion as \"the AMS\"). The operative complaint included three causes of action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), relevant to the appeal:\n\n1. A claim that the AMS\u2019s regulations unlawfully and arbitrarily excluded highly refined foods from the definition and scope of \"bioengineered food\" by tying that definition to detectability of modified genetic material under 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 66.1 and 66.9, thereby exempting many refined foods made from bioengineered ingredients from the disclosure requirement.\n\n2. A claim that the AMS acted contrary to the statute and arbitrarily and capriciously by requiring the use of the term \"bioengineered\" in all mandatory disclosures, and by not requiring or allowing more familiar terms like \"genetically engineered,\" \"genetically modified organism,\" or \"GMO\" to fulfill the disclosure obligation.\n\n3. A claim that two specific disclosure-format regulations\u20147 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.106 (electronic or digital link\/QR code option) and 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.108 (text-message option)\u2014were unlawful and arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs argued that, in view of the statutory study\u2019s finding that electronic\/digital methods did not provide sufficient access, AMS was required to correct the deficiencies in the electronic\/digital link method rather than retain it unchanged, and that the agency lacked statutory authority to add a fourth disclosure option (text messaging) beyond the three specified by Congress (text, symbol, or electronic\/digital link).\n\nThe complaint also included three constitutional claims (not described in detail in the excerpt) that the district court later rejected, and plaintiffs did not pursue those claims on appeal.\n\nIn June 2021, the district court granted permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) to three trade associations: the United States Beet Sugar Association, the American Sugarbeet Growers Association, and the American Farm Bureau Federation (collectively, \"Intervenors\"). These intervenors joined as additional defendants supporting the AMS regulations.\n\nPursuant to a joint case-management proposal, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment in November 2021 on all of their claims. The AMS and Intervenors did not file formal cross-motions for summary judgment; instead, they stated in the joint proposal that they would ask the court to enter summary judgment in their favor under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), which allows a court, after notice and an opportunity to respond, to grant summary judgment for a nonmovant. Plaintiffs acknowledged in that plan that they were on notice that summary judgment might be entered for defendants or intervenors on any or all claims, and that they would have an opportunity to address defendants\u2019 arguments in their reply brief. In their oppositions to plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the AMS and Intervenors expressly requested that the district court deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion and enter judgment in favor of defendants (and intervenors) on all claims under Rule 56(f).\n\nOn September 13, 2022, the district court issued an order and judgment. The court:\n- Granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their APA claim challenging the two disclosure-format provisions, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 66.106 and 66.108, holding those provisions unlawful, and remanded them to the AMS \"without vacatur\" for further proceedings.\n- Denied plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion \"in all other respects,\" which encompassed their APA claims challenging the highly refined foods (detectability) definition and the exclusive use of the term \"bioengineered\" in disclosures, as well as their constitutional claims. The order and judgment did not explicitly state that summary judgment was being entered for defendants and intervenors on the claims for which plaintiffs\u2019 motion was denied.\n\nThe district court entered a judgment the same day reflecting those rulings. Plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal.\n\nAfter appealing, plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion in the district court for an indicative ruling under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1. They sought a statement from the district court that, if the court of appeals remanded for that purpose, the district court would amend its judgment to clarify that it had entered judgment in favor of defendants and intervenors, under Rule 56(f), on all claims as to which plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion was denied\u2014thus confirming the judgment\u2019s finality. Plaintiffs proposed replacement language specifying that, because their motion was denied in all other respects, judgment was entered for defendants and intervenors on all other claims. In March 2023, the district court denied the motion for an indicative ruling, stating that the existing judgment \"provides total clarity on the disposition of the case.\"\n\nOn appeal, the Ninth Circuit examined its jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, given that the district court\u2019s judgment expressly granted summary judgment to plaintiffs only on one APA claim, denied their motion as to all others, and did not explicitly state that judgment was being entered in favor of defendants and intervenors on the remaining claims. After reviewing the whole record, including the summary judgment proceedings, the parties\u2019 motions, and the district court\u2019s entry of judgment, the appellate court construed the judgment as implicitly granting summary judgment to the AMS and Intervenors on all remaining claims under Rule 56(f), thereby treating the judgment as a final, appealable decision disposing of all claims in the case.\n\nThe appellate court also addressed Article III standing. The agency did not contest standing on appeal, but the court examined declarations submitted at summary judgment. It relied on an uncontested declaration from a Natural Grocers officer describing the company\u2019s avoidance of genetically engineered products, including refined foods derived from bioengineered ingredients, and the added costs it incurred to identify such products in the absence of federal disclosure coverage. It also relied on declarations from Center for Food Safety officials and CFS members demonstrating associational standing: members described confusion about the term \"bioengineered\" compared to more familiar terms like \"GMO\" or \"genetically engineered\" and explained the practical difficulties and burdens associated with accessing disclosures through QR codes or text messaging, especially while shopping. The court held that Natural Grocers had standing to challenge the exclusion of highly refined foods from the definition of bioengineered food, and that CFS had associational standing to challenge (1) the exclusive use of the term \"bioengineered\" and (2) the QR-code and text-message disclosure options. Because at least one plaintiff had standing to assert each APA claim at issue, the court proceeded to the merits.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court\u2019s core rulings relevant to the appeal include:\n\n1. Highly refined foods\/detectability definition: The district court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 APA challenge to the regulatory definition of \"bioengineered food\" in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.1 that excludes foods in which genetically modified material is not \"detectable\" pursuant to \u00a7 66.9. The court held that the AMS\u2019s detectability-based approach was lawful and consistent with the statute, and it denied plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion on this claim, implicitly granting summary judgment to defendants and intervenors under Rule 56(f).\n\n2. Required use of the term \"bioengineered\": The district court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 APA challenge to the rule requiring use of the term \"bioengineered\" in all disclosures and disallowing terms like \"genetically engineered\" or \"GMO\" as substitutes for satisfying the mandatory disclosure. The court concluded that AMS\u2019s decision to require a single uniform term and to select \"bioengineered\" was within its statutory authority and not arbitrary and capricious. It denied plaintiffs\u2019 summary judgment motion on this claim, implicitly entering summary judgment for defendants and intervenors.\n\n3. Electronic\/digital link (QR code) and text-message options: The district court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs on their APA claim challenging the electronic\/digital link disclosure provision (7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.106) and the text-message disclosure provision (7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.108). The court held that, in light of the statutory study\u2019s conclusion that consumers lacked sufficient access to disclosures via electronic or digital means under ordinary shopping conditions, the statute required AMS to correct the deficiencies in that disclosure method. The court concluded that AMS acted contrary to law by: (a) retaining the existing electronic\/digital link option, which the study had found inadequate, without fixing its accessibility problems; and (b) adding a new, independent text-message disclosure option as a fourth method, despite statutory language specifying only three forms of disclosure (text, symbol, or electronic\/digital link). As a remedy, the district court remanded \u00a7\u00a7 66.106 and 66.108 to AMS \"without vacatur,\" meaning that both provisions remained in effect while the agency reconsidered them.\n\n4. Constitutional claims: The district court rejected three constitutional claims asserted by plaintiffs, which are not pursued on appeal.\n\n5. Remedy and vacatur: Applying Ninth Circuit precedent that vacatur is the usual APA remedy but may be withheld in limited circumstances, the district court concluded that although the text-message disclosure decision was a \"significant error,\" vacatur of \u00a7\u00a7 66.106 and 66.108 would unduly disrupt consumer access to bioengineering disclosures and disrupt the food industry, which had been required to comply with the regulations as of January 1, 2022. On that basis, the court remanded those rules without vacating them.",

          "On the detectability-based exclusion of highly refined foods, plaintiffs argue that AMS\u2019s regulations unlawfully narrow the statutory definition of \"bioengineering\" in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(1). They contend that the statutory requirement that a food \"contains genetic material\" modified by in vitro recombinant DNA techniques is about actual presence, not detectability under particular testing methods. According to plaintiffs, AMS\u2019s addition of a non-detectability proviso in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.1 improperly rewrites Congress\u2019s definition and effectively exempts many highly refined foods made from bioengineered inputs\u2014foods that, in plaintiffs\u2019 view, still \"contain\" modified genetic material at some point in the production process. They assert that the Act requires disclosure for all foods that contain or may contain bioengineered material, including refined foods, regardless of whether the genetic material is currently measurable by existing tests.",
          "Plaintiffs further argue that AMS cannot justify the detectability provisions by invoking its authority under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B) to determine \"amounts\" of bioengineered substances that may be present in a food for it to be considered bioengineered. They argue that \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B) is intended to expand disclosure coverage or set thresholds that define when minimal, inadvertent traces of bioengineered material still trigger disclosure, not to authorize broad categorical exclusions of certain categories of foods. They also contend that AMS itself relied solely on its reading of the statutory definition of \"bioengineering\" and did not purport to exercise discretion under \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B) or any other threshold-setting authority when it adopted the detectability rule, making any such post hoc justification impermissible under Chenery.",
          "Plaintiffs maintain that the statutory scheme does not permit AMS to exclude highly refined foods based on detectability thresholds, particularly when those foods are intentionally produced from bioengineered inputs, not merely contaminated inadvertently. They argue that any reliance on \"amounts\" of bioengineered substances under \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B) must be limited to incidental or unavoidable contamination, consistent with the separate regulatory provision at 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.5(c), which addresses inadvertent or technically unavoidable presence of bioengineered material. In their view, AMS\u2019s detectability-based exclusions undermine the Act by leaving many foods made from bioengineered ingredients entirely outside the disclosure system.",
          "On the required use of the term \"bioengineered,\" plaintiffs argue that AMS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by refusing to allow or require more familiar terms such as \"genetically engineered,\" \"genetically modified organism,\" or \"GMO\" to satisfy the mandatory disclosure obligation. They point to widespread consumer familiarity with those terms and to the Act\u2019s own references to \"genetically engineered\" foods and \"non-GMO\" claims in other sections, arguing that Congress intended these terms to be treated as equivalent or interchangeable with \"bioengineered.\" Plaintiffs assert that AMS failed to adequately explain why it rejected these familiar terms and that requiring only the less familiar term \"bioengineered\" undermines consumer understanding and the Act\u2019s informational goals.",
          "Plaintiffs also contend that the AMS\u2019s rationale about possible inconsistencies with the Act\u2019s preemption provisions does not justify excluding terms like \"GMO\" and \"genetically engineered\". They argue that the statutory language in the preemption provisions, which includes references to \"genetically engineered\" and \"other similar terms,\" confirms that Congress understood these terms to overlap with \"bioengineered\" and did not intend the narrower statutory definition of \"bioengineering\" to preclude broad use of those more common terms in federal disclosures.",
          "Regarding the electronic\/digital link and text-message options, plaintiffs argue that AMS violated the statute and the APA by retaining the electronic\/digital link option in its existing form even after the mandated study determined that consumers would not have sufficient access to disclosures through that method while shopping. They assert that 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(c)(4) obligates the agency to \"fix\" the access problem revealed by the study\u2014to ensure that any electronic\/digital disclosure is effective and accessible\u2014not merely to add an additional option. They further contend that AMS exceeded its statutory authority by adding a stand-alone text-message option as a fourth disclosure method, beyond the three forms (text, symbol, electronic\/digital link) expressly specified in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(D).",
          "On remedy, plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by remanding \u00a7\u00a7 66.106 and 66.108 without vacatur, despite finding them unlawful. They rely on Ninth Circuit precedent that vacatur is the default remedy under the APA once a rule is held unlawful and that remand without vacatur is reserved for limited circumstances where errors are minor or easily cured and where vacatur would cause serious disruption. Plaintiffs maintain that the errors in \u00a7\u00a7 66.106 and 66.108 are substantive and fundamental, precluding re-adoption of those rules in their existing form on remand. They argue that leaving the unlawful disclosure options in place during the administrative process perpetuates inadequate, statutorily noncompliant disclosures and undermines consumer access to information.",
          "Plaintiffs also challenge the district court\u2019s findings on disruptive consequences. They argue that any disruption to the food industry (due to label changes or transition logistics) can be mitigated through a prospective vacatur that allows for a compliance timeline or sell-through period for existing inventory, rather than a blanket retention of unlawful rules for the entire remand period. They contend there is little or no evidence that vacatur would significantly disrupt consumer access to disclosures; in their view, continuing to allow inadequate electronic\/digital and text-message options is itself a disruption to the statutory goal of providing sufficient access. Plaintiffs urge that the court should at least order a delayed or prospective vacatur, so that regulated entities can phase out the use of the invalidated options while AMS revises the regulations.",
          "On jurisdiction and standing, plaintiffs maintain that the district court\u2019s order and judgment, when viewed in light of the Rule 56(f) procedures and the parties\u2019 explicit requests, should be interpreted as granting summary judgment to defendants on all claims for which plaintiffs\u2019 motion was denied, thus creating a final, appealable decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. On standing, they rely on uncontroverted declarations: Natural Grocers asserts economic and operational injuries stemming from the exclusion of refined foods from the federal disclosure system, which forces it to expend additional resources to meet customer demands for non-GMO products; Center for Food Safety and its members allege informational and practical injuries due to confusing terminology and inaccessible disclosure methods. Plaintiffs assert that these injuries are traceable to the challenged regulations and would likely be remedied by invalidation and revision of those regulations."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "On the detectability-based exclusion of highly refined foods, the AMS argues that its regulations lawfully implement the statutory definition of \"bioengineering.\" It maintains that a food only \"contains\" modified genetic material within the meaning of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639(1) if that material is present at levels detectable by scientifically accepted methods. AMS contends that because the statute does not define \"contain,\" the agency reasonably interpreted the term in light of detection capabilities and the need to administer a workable disclosure regime. It asserts that tying coverage to detectability allows the agency to focus on foods where bioengineered genetic material can be reliably identified and avoids imposing disclosure obligations where no modified genetic material can be confirmed to be present in the finished product.",
          "AMS further contends that its detectability framework is consistent with the statute\u2019s structure, which directs the agency to determine \"the amounts of a bioengineered substance that may be present in a food, as appropriate, in order for the food to be a bioengineered food\" (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B)). According to AMS, this authority encompasses setting thresholds below which the possible presence of bioengineered material does not trigger disclosure. It maintains that the detectability rule is a practical manifestation of Congress\u2019s instruction, because it effectively defines the amount or level of modified genetic material required before a food is considered bioengineered for purposes of labeling. AMS argues that the statute does not mandate disclosure for all products that have ever been produced from bioengineered inputs, irrespective of whether any modified genetic material remains in the final product.",
          "The AMS also points to its separate regulatory provision, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.5(c), which sets a 5% allowance for inadvertent or technically unavoidable presence of bioengineered substances in ingredients, as evidence of its effort to calibrate disclosure obligations to meaningful levels of bioengineered content. It characterizes the detectability rule as part of a broader, coherent regulatory approach that balances statutory objectives with scientific and practical constraints, rather than as an unlawful narrowing of the statute.",
          "On the required terminology, AMS argues that the statute grants it discretion to identify \"similar terms\" but does not compel it to authorize any particular term besides \"bioengineered\". It emphasizes that Congress repeatedly used the term \"bioengineered\" in the disclosure provisions and specially defined \"bioengineering\" by reference to a particular technology\u2014modification through in vitro recombinant DNA techniques. AMS contends that other terms in the marketplace, such as \"genetically engineered\" or \"GMO,\" can be broader or less precise, potentially covering products that fall outside the statutory definition (such as those created through different gene-editing techniques). To avoid confusion about the scope of the national standard and its interaction with the preemption provisions, AMS states it reasonably chose to require a single term\u2014\"bioengineered\"\u2014that aligns with the statutory definition. It notes that manufacturers remain free to include additional terms on labels (such as \"GMO\" or \"genetically engineered\") as long as such statements comply with other applicable laws and do not mislead consumers.",
          "AMS defends its choice of \"bioengineered\" by pointing to the need for consistency and clarity in the marketplace. It argues that allowing different regulated entities to satisfy the disclosure requirement with different terms would confuse consumers and complicate enforcement. It maintains that selecting the statutory term promotes uniformity, communication of the specific technology Congress targeted, and harmonization with the Act\u2019s preemption framework (which, AMS argues, deliberately uses broader language\u2014\"genetically engineered\"\u2014for state-law preemption while specifying a narrower, defined category\u2014\"bioengineered\"\u2014for federal disclosure).",
          "Concerning the electronic\/digital link and text-message options, AMS argues that the statute both mandates inclusion of an electronic or digital link as one of the available disclosure forms and separately requires the agency, upon finding insufficient consumer access, to provide \"additional and comparable options\". AMS interprets the statute as requiring retention of the electronic\/digital link option, not elimination of that option altogether if the access study reveals problems. It contends that adding a text-message option as an additional method of access satisfies the requirement to provide \"additional and comparable options\" while preserving the statutorily mandated electronic\/digital method. AMS maintains that the Act\u2019s enumeration of text, symbol, and electronic\/digital link in \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(D) does not bar the agency from offering an additional, comparable disclosure mechanism (such as text messaging) under the separate authority in \u00a7 1639b(c)(4).",
          "On remedy, AMS argues that remand without vacatur was appropriate and consistent with Ninth Circuit law. It emphasizes that the food industry had already made significant investments to comply with the labeling rules, including implementing QR codes and establishing text-message systems, by the time of the district court\u2019s decision; that tens of thousands of products had already adopted the electronic\/digital link option; and that vacatur would require substantial, costly label revisions and other changes on relatively short notice. AMS contends that such disruption, including potential confusion about when or whether previously compliant products could remain on the market, justifies allowing the challenged provisions to remain in effect while AMS conducts additional rulemaking to correct any identified legal deficiencies.",
          "AMS also argues that immediate vacatur could temporarily decrease consumer access to bioengineering disclosures. It notes that, if the electronic\/digital link and text-message options were vacated before replacement regulations were promulgated, some manufacturers might rely solely on text or symbol disclosures in ways that are not yet standardized or optimized for consumer understanding, or might need time before transitioning away from QR codes and text messaging. AMS maintains that, in light of these potential disruptions, the district court reasonably exercised its equitable discretion to remand without vacatur, thereby allowing the existing rules to operate during the interim period while AMS revises the regulatory scheme.",
          "With respect to appellate jurisdiction, AMS ultimately does not challenge the Ninth Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction but emphasizes that the district court intended to dispose of all claims in its September 2022 order and judgment. It notes that plaintiffs were on notice that the court might grant summary judgment to defendants and intervenors on non-prevailing claims under Rule 56(f), that the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion \"in all other respects,\" and that the court entered a judgment indicating final resolution of the case. AMS submits that any ambiguity in the judgment language was adequately resolved by interpreting the judgment in light of the full record and procedural history.",
          "On standing, AMS does not contest plaintiffs\u2019 standing on appeal. It does not submit contrary evidence to the declarations offered by Natural Grocers and Center for Food Safety. It relies on the district court\u2019s acceptance of those declarations and on the appellate court\u2019s independent duty to assure standing as satisfied by at least one plaintiff for each claim, while arguing the case on the merits."

AMS rewrote that definition in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 66.1 by adding a non\u2011detectability carveout and then operationalizing it in \u00a7 66.9. Nothing in the text ties \u201ccontains\u201d to what current tests can detect, and Congress elsewhere explicitly granted threshold\u2011setting authority in \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B), which would be largely redundant if \u201ccontains\u201d already meant \u201cdetectably contains.\u201d Given the express, detailed statutory definition and the separate threshold provision, the better reading is that AMS lacked authority to narrow the defined term by building detectability into the definition itself.

Even on the merits, \u00a7 1639b(b)(2)(B) speaks to setting amounts of \u201ca bioengineered substance\u201d that may be present, which fits minimal or inadvertent content, not wholesale exclusion of entire categories of intentionally bioengineered\u2011derived refined foods.

In October 2012, Superstorm Sandy struck the area and inundated Madelaine Chocolate\u2019s factory with more than three feet of saltwater. Madelaine Chocolate claimed that the storm caused over $53 million in physical damage to its production facility and related economic losses. It submitted a claim for these losses under a commercial insurance policy issued by Great Northern Insurance Company. Great Northern did not pay the full amount sought and instead paid approximately $4 million. In explaining its denial of most of the claimed amount, Great Northern relied on the policy\u2019s flood-exclusion provision, which excludes, in relevant part, loss or damage caused by the rising, overflowing, or breaking of any boundary of any body of water, whether driven by wind or not (referred to as the Flood Exclusion). The Flood Exclusion includes an anti-concurrent causation (ACC) clause stating that the exclusion applies regardless of any other cause or event that directly or indirectly contributes to the loss or damage. Great Northern\u2019s position was that Madelaine Chocolate\u2019s losses were caused, at least in part, by wind-driven flooding or storm surge and therefore were excluded under the Flood Exclusion and its ACC clause. Madelaine Chocolate, in contrast, maintained that its losses were caused by a \"windstorm,\" which is listed as a \"specified peril\" under the policy. Although the main policy did not define \"windstorm,\" the policy contained a form entitled \"Windstorm Or Hail Deductible Or Waiting Period\" (the Windstorm Endorsement). That endorsement defined \"windstorm\" to include \"wind-driven rain\" and provided that this definition applied regardless of any other cause or event that directly or indirectly contributes to the loss or damage\u2014language characterized as an arguably inverse ACC clause because it operates in favor of coverage for the defined peril. Madelaine Chocolate argued that this Windstorm Endorsement either independently provided coverage for its storm-surge losses or at least created an ambiguity when read together with the Flood Exclusion that had to be resolved in its favor. The parties also presented evidence about Madelaine Chocolate\u2019s insurance purchasing history and communications. Evidence at trial included testimony from Madelaine Chocolate executives that the company had discontinued a $2.5 million excess-flood insurance policy in 2001; correspondence in which Madelaine Chocolate, when asked by a third party to disclose its flood insurance, listed only $3 million in coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program and did not list any flood coverage from Great Northern; and a loss-control report from a Great Northern professional to the head of Madelaine Chocolate\u2019s insurance program that addressed natural hazards in separate sections, including distinct sections for windstorms and for flood hazards. Great Northern relied on this information to argue that both parties understood that the Great Northern policy did not provide coverage for storm-surge or flood-type losses, while Madelaine Chocolate argued that the policy, particularly through the Windstorm Endorsement, did provide or at least appeared to provide such coverage.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"After Great Northern limited its payment on the Superstorm Sandy claim to about $4 million and denied the bulk of the claim by invoking the Flood Exclusion and its ACC clause, Madelaine Chocolate filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging breach of contract and seeking coverage for its alleged more than $53 million in storm-related physical damage and economic losses. Madelaine Chocolate\u2019s core position was that the losses were caused by a covered windstorm peril under the policy, as modified or clarified by the Windstorm Endorsement, and that any ambiguity between that endorsement and the Flood Exclusion should be construed in its favor.",
        "district_court_decision":"In an initial ruling, the district court concluded that the policy language was unambiguous and granted summary judgment in favor of Great Northern. The court determined that Madelaine Chocolate\u2019s losses were caused by storm surge and, under then-existing precedent interpreting similar language, the Flood Exclusion applied to exclude coverage. The court further found that the Windstorm Endorsement merely addressed that the policy provided coverage for wind-related damage and adjusted the applicable deductible or waiting period; it did not provide a separate basis for coverage nor supersede the Flood Exclusion. On appeal, the Second Circuit vacated that judgment and remanded, directing the district court to consider the effect of the Windstorm Endorsement\u2019s own ACC clause and whether it conflicted with or created ambiguity in relation to the Flood Exclusion. On remand, the district court found that the Windstorm Endorsement\u2019s definition of \"windstorm\" and its ACC clause did create an ambiguity vis-\u00e0-vis the Flood Exclusion when the policy was read as a whole. The court then considered extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intent. Because there was extrinsic evidence that could support an interpretation of the policy that foreclosed coverage, the court concluded it could not resolve the ambiguity as a matter of law in favor of the insured and that the doctrine of contra proferentem need not be applied at the summary judgment stage. The district court denied both parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and set the case for a jury trial. Following a week-long trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Great Northern. Madelaine Chocolate then filed post-trial motions for judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 and, alternatively, for a new trial under Rule 59. The district court denied both motions.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Madelaine Chocolate appeals the district court\u2019s August 24, 2022 judgment, which followed the jury verdict in Great Northern\u2019s favor, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law and its Rule 59 motion for a new trial. On appeal, Madelaine Chocolate challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict in light of the burden imposed on the insurer under New York law, argues that the district court improperly allowed the jury to consider evidence of Great Northern\u2019s uncommunicated subjective intent regarding the policy\u2019s meaning, and contends that, under the law-of-the-case doctrine, Great Northern should not have been permitted at trial to advance its particular interpretation of the Windstorm Endorsement\u2019s function in relation to the Flood Exclusion."

          "As to the law-of-the-case doctrine, Great Northern argues that the prior Second Circuit remand order did not decide how the Windstorm Endorsement should ultimately be interpreted, nor did it determine whether the policy was ambiguous as a matter of law or what the parties intended regarding coverage for storm-surge losses. Instead, the appellate court simply directed the district court to consider the potential interaction between the Windstorm Endorsement\u2019s ACC clause and the Flood Exclusion.

The record contained several pieces of objective extrinsic evidence supporting Great Northern\u2019s interpretation: (1) Madelaine\u2019s prior purchase and later discontinuance of excess-flood coverage, indicating an understanding that flood-type losses required separate insurance; (2) Madelaine\u2019s disclosure to a third party that it had only NFIP flood insurance, with no mention of flood coverage under the Great Northern policy; and (3) a Great Northern loss-control report that treated windstorm and flood as distinct hazards, consistent with a separation between windstorm coverage and flood exclusions. Under New York law, once ambiguity is found and extrinsic evidence is admitted, the insurer\u2019s burden at trial is to persuade by a preponderance of the evidence, not to show that its reading is the only conceivable one. Given the objective evidence from both sides, a reasonable jury could conclude the parties did not intend coverage for storm-surge (flood-type) losses.

The summary indicates the court first determined ambiguity as a matter of law by examining the policy and then, at trial, admitted evidence including Great Northern\u2019s internal materials in the context of industry practice, underwriting, and loss-control communications. That sort of evidence can permissibly illustrate how the parties treated windstorm versus flood in practice and thus bears on their mutual understanding. There is no indication the district court allowed the jury to decide ambiguity itself or to rely solely on undisclosed subjective beliefs detached from negotiations or conduct. Under these circumstances, the appellate court is unlikely to find an abuse of discretion in allowing the jury to consider this evidence."

Nor did it resolve the ultimate interpretation of the policy or the parties\u2019 intent. On remand, the district court found ambiguity, admitted extrinsic evidence, and allowed both interpretations to go to the jury, including Great Northern\u2019s argument that the endorsement only adjusted deductibles\/waiting periods and did not expand coverage for flood-type losses.

On appeal, Madelaine\u2019s principal attacks either recharacterize the insurer\u2019s trial burden as effectively requiring it to prove its interpretation was the only plausible one, or seek to re-litigate evidentiary and interpretive issues that lie within the district court\u2019s discretion and that the earlier appellate mandate did not resolve. The record described contains several pieces of concrete, objective evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the parties did not intend coverage for storm-surge (flood-type) losses, defeating the Rule 50 challenge. The evidentiary rulings and denial of a new trial are reviewed for abuse of discretion and are supported by the broad latitude courts have in admitting extrinsic evidence once ambiguity is established and in assessing whether any errors affected the fairness of the trial. Finally, the prior remand left the ultimate interpretation of the Windstorm Endorsement and its interplay with the Flood Exclusion open, so the law-of-the-case doctrine does not bar Great Northern\u2019s trial arguments.

      "factual_background":"The case arises out of events at MIT during the 2023\u20132024 academic year following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and ensuing war in Gaza. Plaintiffs allege that anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian activism and protests at MIT created an antisemitic and anti-Israeli hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students and that MIT failed to respond adequately.\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing hundreds of civilians and taking hostages. That same day, the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA), then a recognized student group, reposted tweets asserting, among other things, that Palestinians could not \"invade\" Palestine, framing events as a response to Israeli military activity and blockade, and criticizing references to Palestinians entering \"Israeli territory.\"\n\nOn October 8, 2023, CAA and another student group, Palestine@MIT, emailed all undergraduates a \"Joint Statement on the Current Situation in Palestine.\" The statement blamed \"the Israeli regime\" for the violence, denounced the \"Israeli occupation\" and \"racist apartheid system,\" affirmed \"the right of all occupied people to resist oppression and colonization,\" and was signed \"[u]ntil liberation.\" An Instagram post indicated support from the MIT Black Graduate Student Association and MIT Reading for Revolution.\n\nOn October 10, 2023, pro\u2011Palestinian students chalked \"Free Palestine\" and \"Occupation on Gaza\" outside a vigil organized by Jewish students. On or about October 17, 2023, a CAA student emailed all student\u2011group members claiming Israel had bombed the al\u2011Ahli Arab Hospital and killed over 500 people; plaintiffs allege this account was later discredited. Jewish students who attempted to share contrary information online were criticized by peers; one unidentified student felt unable to continue in a study group due to that criticism.\n\nOn October 19, 2023, CAA led a rally outside the MIT Student Center. Chants included \"Palestine will be free, from the river to the sea!\" and \"There is only one solution! Intifada revolution!\" Plaintiff Meyers and another Jewish student were approached by an attendee who raised the front wheels of his bicycle at them and stated, referring to Holocaust victims, \"Your ancestors didn't die to kill more people.\" Plaintiffs allege this rally caused Jewish and Israeli students, including plaintiffs, to feel unsafe or unwelcome. MIT was aware of the rally through reports and security monitoring.\n\nFour days later, CAA staged a walkout in which protestors left class, disrupted some classes by shouting and unfurling Palestinian flags, and gathered in Lobby 7, a heavily trafficked passageway frequently used by plaintiffs Boukin and Meyers. Lobby 7 was not a designated protest area. The following week, CAA organized a \"Die In\" in Lobby 7 and posted pictures of Gazans on lecture halls and buildings. MIT did not stop the \"Die In.\"\n\nOn November 2, 2023, CAA held a protest outside the offices of Jewish professors and MIT\u2019s Israel internship program, MISTI. Protestors rattled office door handles, chanted \"From the river to the sea\" and \"MISTI, MISTI, you can't hide,\" and accused MISTI of \"genocide.\" Staff reported feeling alarmed and intimidated. Plaintiffs do not allege that Jewish or Israeli students were present during this event.\n\nPlaintiffs allege MIT did not send police or discipline student participants at any of these four early protests. Six days after the November 2 protest, MIT issued a communication tightening rules on campus protests, postering, and free expression, including rules against disrupting living, working, and learning spaces and restricting large banners and flags.\n\nOn November 9, 2023, CAA, Coalition for Palestine, and others led another protest in Lobby 7 involving MIT faculty, staff, and members of the public. Chants included \"From the river to the sea,\" \"Resistance is justified,\" and calls for \"intifada.\" A Jewish student recording the protest was shoved by an unidentified protester. MIT Hillel advised Jewish students not to engage directly with protestors for safety reasons and suggested avoiding Lobby 7.\n\nAt noon, about four hours after that protest began, MIT officials warned protestors they could be disciplined if they did not leave Lobby 7 within 15 minutes. A group of Jewish counter\u2011protestors left, but the pro\u2011Palestinian protestors stayed. President Sally Kornbluth later wrote to the MIT community that the protest was disruptive, violated MIT policies, and raised concerns about potential violence. She announced that students who remained past the deadline would be suspended from non\u2011academic campus activities on an interim basis and referred to an Ad Hoc Complaint Response Team for final adjudication. MIT did not publicly state whether further discipline was imposed. The head of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning emailed students promising support for students involved in the protest.\n\nBefore February 26, 2024, CAA held a protest outside MIT's Institute Discrimination and Harassment Response (IDHR) office, after which IDHR issued no\u2011contact orders between CAA members and IDHR staff. In mid\u2011February 2024, CAA held another protest in Lobby 7, with large flags and chants of \"From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free!\" The next day, MIT suspended CAA\u2019s status as a recognized student group.\n\nPlaintiffs allege wider campus turmoil. On November 14, 2023, MIT announced a \"Standing Together Against Hate\" initiative to combat antisemitism, but some Jewish and Israeli faculty later resigned from the committee, believing it was insufficiently addressing antisemitism. In the November\/December 2023 Faculty Newsletter, Professor Michel DeGraff published an opinion piece supporting pro\u2011Palestinian protestors, describing Israeli actions as \"war crimes\" and \"genocide\" against Palestinians, and suggesting racism might underlie MIT\u2019s focus on antisemitism rather than islamophobia, ending with \"from the river to the sea, from Gaza to MIT.\"\n\nIn December 2023, the MIT Women\u2019s and Gender Studies Department and MIT Coalition for Palestine co\u2011hosted an event inviting students to a book club on a work by Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi, who had allegedly posted a statement online threatening settlers and referencing Hitler. On December 6, 2023, Israeli\u2011American author Miko Peled, in a talk organized by CAA and MIT Coalition for Palestine, allegedly encouraged attendees to go to MIT Hillel to confront Jewish students about Gaza and joked about not being permitted to say \"From the river to the sea,\" prompting that chant from students.\n\nOn December 13, 2023, lecturer Mauricio Karchmer publicly resigned from MIT, stating he could no longer teach those who condemned his Jewish identity or support for Israel\u2019s right to exist in peace. In January 2024, a non\u2011Jewish student emailed MIT complaining about comments by an Interfaith Chaplain and Spiritual Advisor to the Indigenous Community at an interfaith event, where the chaplain allegedly said Palestinians were oppressed by \"white European colonizers.\" Shortly thereafter, MIT Israel Alliance, of which at least one plaintiff was a member, emailed MIT administration complaining that MIT was failing to deter discriminatory and harassing behavior toward Jewish and Israeli students and stating that some Jewish students had relocated or chosen to stay in Israel as a result.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, plaintiffs filed their initial federal complaint. That same month, pro\u2011Palestinian student activists allegedly began a campaign emailing faculty whose research related to Israel, accusing them of being complicit in Israel\u2019s \"crimes against humanity\" and urging them to stop Israel\u2011related projects and reject future contracts with the Israeli military and similar entities. Activists also contacted students of these faculty, asking them to \"reflect\" on their professors\u2019 receipt of Israeli funding. CAA and Graduates for Palestine posted on Instagram, publicly naming faculty whose research was funded by Israel and stating their information came from an internal MIT grant management tool that plaintiffs say is normally restricted to faculty and staff.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that throughout spring 2024 MIT permitted \"antisemitic posters\" to remain on campus, including a poster depicting two cuffed fists with the statement \"No to Zionism and Racism\" that purportedly hung for about a month.\n\nOn April 21, 2024, pro\u2011Palestinian protestors established an encampment on Kresge Lawn, a central campus area adjacent to MIT Hillel. Approximately 30 students and 15 tents participated initially. Signs at the encampment included statements characterizing Zionism as apartheid, genocide, murder, and a racist ideology, calling it a \"death cult,\" and equating police, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Israeli Defense Forces (\"IOF\"). CAA used social media to call for support of the encampment, declared solidarity with Palestinians, criticized MIT\u2019s \"complicity\" in the conflict, and urged support for a referendum calling for a permanent ceasefire and severing MIT\u2019s ties with the Israeli military. CAA also asserted they would \"continue to be loud\" and not be deterred.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that Jewish students, disturbed by the encampment and protests, moved a Passover seder from Hillel to an off\u2011campus location and sought permission to attend classes remotely. A graduate student emailed MIT\u2019s President and other administrators complaining that the encampment created a hostile environment making it difficult for Jewish and Israeli students to work or study and requesting assurances that MIT would not \"both sides\" the encampment. Chancellor Melissa Nobles responded that MIT understood the concerns and was pursuing constructive dialogue with protestors, asking for patience and urging the student and peers not to counter\u2011protest.\n\nThe encampment remained from April 21 to May 10, 2024. About a week in, President Kornbluth released a public video and statement acknowledging that the encampment violated campus rules for demonstrations while stating it had so far been peaceful. She indicated participating students would face disciplinary action, described an agreement with protestors to limit noise after 7:30 p.m., and directed campus police to monitor the encampment around the clock. She indicated she believed the protestors\u2019 chants were protected speech under MIT\u2019s free expression principles, but that the encampment needed to end soon. She rejected calls to curtail the academic freedom of faculty engaged in Israel\u2011related research or funded by Israeli sources.\n\nWhen the encampment continued, MIT installed high fencing around it on May 3, 2024, to contain it. On May 4, journalists recorded protestors chanting slogans in Arabic which, according to plaintiffs, could be translated as \"From water to water, Palestine is Arab!\"; \"Palestine is free, Israel out\"; \"We want to talk about the obvious, we don't want to see Zionists\"; \"The iron gates of Al Aqsa, open for the martyr!\"; and \"From water to water, death to Zionism!\" Plaintiffs do not allege MIT was informed of the translations or understood their meaning.\n\nOn May 6, 2024, the encampment still active, MIT informed protestors that if they did not leave by 2:30 p.m., they would face discipline. Protest organizers responded via social media by calling more people to join. An individual jumped the fence, prompting a broader surge in which more protestors entered the encampment area, and by that evening about 150 protestors were present.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, MIT Hillel had planned an Israel\u2011related celebration on Kresge Lawn but relocated because of the encampment. On May 8, protestors escalated activities by blocking the entrance and exit of the Stata Center garage and defacing or discarding Israeli and American flags. The next day, they again blocked access to the garage and shut down nearby Vassar Street, preventing MIT community members from entering and exiting; nine students were arrested.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, MIT cleared the encampment; ten students who remained were arrested. MIT issued a public statement asserting that freedom of expression did not protect continued use of a shared campus resource in violation of longstanding rules and provided a timeline of events to explain its decision.\n\nSeparately, plaintiffs allege a series of specific antisemitic incidents or statements during this period, including: protestors allegedly blocking plaintiff Boukin from entering Lobby 7 on one occasion because she was Jewish while allowing others to pass; denying her entry to the encampment area on one occasion on that basis; CAA members allegedly heckling a visibly Jewish individual; a graduate student tweet allegedly comparing Jews to Nazis; and advice by an invited speaker to confront Jewish students at Hillel. Plaintiffs also reference an incident in which a man allegedly urinated on Hillel after an MIT protest, although they acknowledge the attached report described him as someone with paranoid beliefs and not affiliated with MIT.",

          "On Title VI, plaintiffs argue that their complaint plausibly alleges a hostile environment directed at Jewish and Israeli students. They contend that widespread campus protests, repeated slogans such as \"From the river to the sea\" and \"intifada,\" hostile statements and events, the Kresge Lawn encampment near Hillel, and targeted conduct (including alleged blocking of Jewish students\u2019 access to certain campus areas, doxing of faculty with Israeli ties, social\u2011media shaming, and antisemitic posters) collectively constitute severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive antisemitic harassment. They emphasize that anti\u2011Zionist rhetoric, in their view, is inherently antisemitic because Zionism is central to Jewish self\u2011determination and identity, and that calls to eliminate Zionism or to make all of Palestine \"free\" should be understood as calls to dismantle the Jewish state and threaten Jews. They further argue that the harassment materially interfered with Jewish and Israeli students\u2019 education by making it difficult or impossible for them to attend classes or campus events, forcing some to relocate or consider leaving MIT, and causing them to alter religious observances and daily routines (e.g., moving Passover events off campus, avoiding certain campus paths). They assert MIT had actual knowledge of the hostile environment and specific incidents through direct complaints from students and faculty, widely publicized protests, security monitoring, and communications from governmental officials, and that MIT was deliberately indifferent because it failed to act promptly or forcefully\u2014delaying discipline, not clearly or consistently sanctioning violators, and allowing protests and encampments to continue for weeks in central locations. Plaintiffs argue that MIT\u2019s measures were minimal, slow, and ineffective, and did not prioritize the safety and equal educational participation of Jewish and Israeli students.",
          "Regarding the Ku Klux Klan Act, plaintiffs argue their complaint plausibly alleges a conspiracy among CAA and allied student groups under \u00a7 1985(3), and that MIT can be liable under \u00a7 1986 for knowingly failing to prevent it. They contend the student organizations coordinated actions\u2014joint statements, organized rallies, walkouts, targeted protests outside Jewish professors\u2019 and MISTI offices, campaigns against faculty funded by Israel, and the Kresge encampment\u2014with the conscious objective of intimidating and marginalizing Jewish and Israeli students and interfering with their rights to be free from racial violence, to make and enforce educational and related contracts, and to enjoy property such as campus facilities. Plaintiffs point to statements accusing Jewish\u2011associated programs of genocide, calls to confront Jewish students at Hillel, and actions such as blocking Jewish students\u2019 movement and doxing faculty to argue that the protests were not merely political but aimed at impairing the civil rights of a protected class. They maintain that these group\u2011coordinated activities and public calls for action show the agreement and discriminatory purpose required by \u00a7 1985(3), and that MIT, aware of these developments, violated \u00a7 1986 by not taking available steps to prevent or adequately respond to them.",

They argue that MIT breached those contracts by failing to enforce its own policies and to provide the promised protections and environment free from antisemitic harassment. They also argue that MIT owed a duty of reasonable care to protect students from foreseeable antisemitic harassment and that its alleged inaction or insufficient action in the face of known hostility and specific threats breached that duty. They maintain that the district court should have retained supplemental jurisdiction over these claims or, at minimum, not foreclosed them without full consideration.",

          "On Title VI, MIT argues that the complaint does not plausibly allege the kind of severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment based on race or national origin that is required to state a hostile\u2011environment claim. MIT contends that the vast majority of the conduct alleged consists of core political speech and protest activity about the Israel\u2011Palestine conflict\u2014speech on a matter of public concern\u2014which is not inherently antisemitic and is protected under First Amendment principles that inform the interpretation of Title VI. It maintains that criticism of Israel, opposition to Zionism, calls for divestment, and pro\u2011Palestinian slogans cannot be automatically equated with antisemitism and that plaintiffs\u2019 theory depends on conclusory assertions that all anti\u2011Zionist or pro\u2011Palestinian speech is antisemitic. MIT also argues that, even accepting the allegations as true, the specifically antisemitic incidents identified are few, scattered, and often not directed at the named plaintiffs, and do not rise to the level of a systemic denial of educational access. Moreover, MIT contends plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that responsible MIT officials had actual knowledge of those specific antisemitic incidents as opposed to general awareness of campus protests. Finally, MIT asserts that its responses\u2014issuing and tightening protest and expression policies, meeting with Jewish community leaders, imposing interim suspensions from non\u2011academic activities, suspending CAA as a student group, stationing police at the encampment, fencing and eventually clearing the encampment, and accommodating competing interests\u2014demonstrate that it was not deliberately indifferent and that, at most, plaintiffs are second\u2011guessing good\u2011faith administrative judgments in a complex and volatile situation.",
          "Regarding the Ku Klux Klan Act claims, MIT argues that plaintiffs fail at the threshold to plead a plausible \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy with the required discriminatory purpose. It contends that the student groups\u2019 stated aims\u2014pressuring MIT to divest from Israel, sever ties with the Israeli military, show solidarity with Palestinians and with protestors at other universities, and oppose what they describe as genocide or apartheid\u2014are facially political objectives, not a plan to deny Jewish students equal protection of the laws or to interfere with their contract or property rights. MIT notes that the complaint\u2019s references to two physical encounters (a raised bicycle wheel and a shove) and various other harms are isolated, not alleged to have been planned or authorized by the groups, and insufficient to show that \"racially or ethnically motivated violence\" was the conscious objective of a conspiracy. It argues that plaintiffs improperly infer conspiratorial purpose from alleged effects on Jewish and Israeli students, which is not enough under \u00a7 1985(3), and that conclusory characterizations of the protests as \"violent\" or \"antisemitic\" cannot substitute for specific allegations of agreement and intent. Consequently, without a valid \u00a7 1985(3) predicate, the \u00a7 1986 claim necessarily fails.",
          "As to the state\u2011law contract and negligence claims, MIT maintains that once the district court correctly determined that the federal claims should be dismissed at the pleading stage, it acted within its discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) in declining supplemental jurisdiction over purely state\u2011law issues. MIT emphasizes the general rule favoring dismissal without prejudice of state claims when federal claims are dismissed early, and argues there was nothing exceptional in this case that would warrant retaining jurisdiction.",
          "On leave to amend, MIT contends that plaintiffs never properly moved to amend their complaint a second time. It points out that plaintiffs\u2019 only reference to amendment was a single sentence in their opposition to the motion to dismiss, phrased conditionally and without attaching a proposed amended pleading or specifying new facts. MIT argues that under First Circuit precedent such an informal, embedded request does not obligate the district court to grant or even address leave to amend sua sponte. In its view, the district court reasonably proceeded to rule on the sufficiency of the amended complaint without entertaining an undeveloped, conditional request."

The narrative here is dominated by large\u2011scale, political, pro\u2011Palestinian\/anti\u2011Israel protest activity, slogans, encampments, and criticism of Israeli policy and Zionism. Under Davis and related Title IX\/Title VI precedent, and in light of background First Amendment concerns that courts routinely invoke in campus\u2011speech hostile\u2011environment cases, courts are reluctant to treat core political expression\u2014without pervasive directed threats or harassment\u2014as actionable discrimination. The specifically targeted or arguably antisemitic incidents are relatively few, sporadic, and thinly linked to MIT\u2019s knowledge (e.g., the raised bicycle wheel and offensive remark, a shove, some alleged blocking of passage, scattered online comments). The complaint does not plausibly allege that MIT officials knew of and ignored a pattern of direct, discriminatory, physical or verbal harassment of the plaintiffs themselves that effectively denied them access to MIT\u2019s programs. MIT\u2019s multi\u2011step responses\u2014tightening protest rules, warning of and imposing discipline, suspending CAA, policing and ultimately dismantling the encampment\u2014are not \u2018clearly unreasonable\u2019 as a matter of law, even if plaintiffs regard them as too slow or lenient. Given First Circuit tendencies to enforce Davis\u2019s demanding standards and to distinguish political speech from actionable harassment, the panel is likely to agree that the amended complaint, though describing a tense and distressing atmosphere, does not plead a Title VI hostile\u2011environment claim to the plausibility threshold. The dismissal is therefore affirmed."

The pleaded aims\u2014divestment from Israel, opposition to perceived \u2018genocide\u2019\/\u2018apartheid,\u2019 solidarity with Palestinians\u2014are on their face political.

Plaintiffs largely infer conspiratorial purpose from the effect the protests allegedly had on Jewish and Israeli students. Under Twombly\/Iqbal and established \u00a7 1985(3) doctrine, such conclusory assertions of \u2018conspiracy\u2019 and \u2018violent intent\u2019 are insufficient.

The court\u2019s entry of final judgment on the operative amended complaint, without separately inviting another amendment, is treated as an implicit denial of leave and is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Here, given plaintiffs\u2019 opportunity to replead, the nature of the deficiencies (legal and structural rather than a few missing particulars), and the failure to file a formal motion or show how amendment would change the analysis, the district court acted within its discretion in not granting further leave.

Those features make affirmance on de novo review likely. The \u00a7 1985(3)\/\u00a7 1986 theory is even weaker, because the complaint does not allege a nonconclusory agreement whose objective is to deny civil rights, as opposed to coordinated political advocacy about Israel\/Palestine; courts routinely reject such attempts to reframe protest coalitions as Klan Act conspiracies. Once the federal claims fall out early, declining supplemental jurisdiction over state\u2011law claims is routine and well within the district court\u2019s discretion. Finally, under settled First Circuit law, an informal, contingent request to amend embedded in an opposition brief\u2014without a proposed amended complaint or specific new facts\u2014does not oblige a court to grant leave sua sponte, especially after one amendment has already been allowed.

      "factual_background":"Beginning around October\u2013December 2015, Cheriese Johnson began experiencing a variety of health problems, including joint pain and swelling, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, chronic vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, and other symptoms. In July 2016 she was hired to work in human resources at The William Carter Company. When she began that job, she purchased long-term disability insurance issued and administered by Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company. The long-term disability policy became effective on October 12, 2016.\n\nThe Reliance policy contained a 'Pre-existing Conditions Limitation.' Under that limitation, if an insured became 'totally disabled' within one year after the effective date of coverage, Reliance could deny benefits if the disability was '(1) caused by; (2) contributed to by; or (3) resulting from; a Pre-existing Condition.' The policy defined a 'Pre-Existing Condition' as 'any Sickness or Injury for which the Insured received medical Treatment, consultation, care or services, including diagnostic procedures, or took prescribed drugs or medicines' during a three-month 'lookback period' immediately prior to the effective date of insurance. For Johnson, the lookback period was July 12, 2016 through October 12, 2016.\n\nJohnson\u2019s health problems continued and she sought extensive medical care, including during the lookback period. During that period she saw multiple providers and reported numerous symptoms:\n- On August 15, 2016 she was seen in follow-up with assessments of fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting. A nurse practitioner continued her prescriptions for Cyclobenzaprine and Zofran.\n- On August 23, 2016 she underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, which showed gastritis and a hiatal hernia.\n- On September 6, 2016 she was treated for vomiting, nosebleeds, memory loss, body aches, and joint swelling. She was diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori infection, epistaxis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, edema, and hypertension, and prescribed several medications, none directed to scleroderma.\n- On September 13, 2016 she sought treatment for a post-syncopal episode and low blood sugar, and was diagnosed with bronchitis, fatigue, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and sleep apnea.\n- On September 30, 2016 she was treated for numbness, coldness and pain in all extremities, nausea, vomiting, forgetfulness, cognitive impairment, fatigue, bowel control issues, blurred vision, fever, dropping things frequently, headaches, decreased appetite, syncope, dizziness, generalized aching, swelling of feet and hands, and loss of motor skills.\n\nAcross these and other visits, she presented more than a dozen symptoms including nausea, vomiting, cough, fatigue, swelling of hands and feet, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, Raynaud-type symptoms, chronic pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, decreased appetite, syncope, dizziness, generalized aching, and loss of motor skills. During this pre-coverage period she received at least ten diagnoses, among them fibromyalgia, borderline lupus erythematosus, probable somatoform disorder, Helicobacter pylori infection, epistaxis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, edema, hypertension, sleep apnea, and bronchitis. None of her providers diagnosed scleroderma at that time, and according to the record neither Johnson nor her physicians suspected scleroderma prior to a later biopsy.\n\nOn January 26, 2017, about four months after the policy became effective, Johnson\u2019s symptoms had progressed to the point that she could no longer work; under the policy\u2019s terminology this constituted 'total disability.' In February 2017, approximately four months after the end of the lookback period, she underwent a lung biopsy to further investigate her symptoms. The biopsy led to a diagnosis of scleroderma, described in the record as a rare, chronic autoimmune disease in which normal tissue is replaced with dense, thick fibrous tissue. Typical symptoms include joint pain and stiffness, persistent cough, shortness of breath, digestive and gastrointestinal problems, and fatigue. The record reflects that neither Johnson nor any of her treating specialists (including a neurologist, pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, and rheumatologist) suspected scleroderma before the lung biopsy.\n\nIn October 2017, about eight months after the biopsy diagnosis, Johnson filed a claim with Reliance Standard for long-term disability benefits, asserting that she was disabled by scleroderma and that her disabling symptoms were attributable to that disease. Her rheumatologist later confirmed that Johnson\u2019s symptoms of scleroderma began in October 2015 and that he treated her for those symptoms every one to three months, including during the lookback period, although the scleroderma diagnosis was not made until later.",

She argues that the phrase 'for which' connotes an intent or purpose to treat a particular condition, so that treatment must be directed toward, or at least be for a suspected instance of, the later-diagnosed condition itself, not just for generic or non-specific symptoms.",
          "She emphasizes that during the three-month lookback period, none of her providers suspected, diagnosed, or attempted to treat scleroderma. Instead, they diagnosed and treated other conditions such as fibromyalgia, borderline lupus erythematosus, somatoform disorder, Helicobacter pylori infection, epistaxis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, edema, hypertension, sleep apnea, and bronchitis. According to Johnson, because no one suspected scleroderma, she did not receive treatment 'for' scleroderma within the meaning of the policy, even if some of her symptoms were later understood as manifestations of that disease.",
          "Johnson maintains that the insurer\u2019s interpretation turns the policy into a 'preexisting symptom' exclusion rather than a 'preexisting condition' exclusion, allowing denial of coverage whenever an insured sought medical care for any symptom that, in hindsight, is consistent with the ultimate diagnosis. She argues this reading is inconsistent with the policy\u2019s actual wording, which speaks in terms of a 'Sickness or Injury' rather than symptoms, and that it would lead to extreme results, such as treating advice to drink more water for a headache as treatment for an undiscovered brain tumor.",
          "She argues that federal common law under ERISA and persuasive authority from other circuits recognize that when a policy uses 'for' in a pre-existing condition definition, there is an implicit requirement that treatment be aimed at, or at least tied in the provider\u2019s mind to, the condition in question; treating non-specific symptoms without any suspicion of the later-diagnosed condition is not treatment 'for' that condition.",
          "On the standard of review, Johnson accepts that the plan grants Reliance discretionary authority but contends that even under arbitrary-and-capricious review the denial cannot stand, because Reliance\u2019s interpretation ignores the ordinary meaning of the policy language and effectively rewrites the contract.

Reliance interprets 'for' in context to mean 'because of' rather than to impose an intent-to-treat requirement.",
          "Reliance contends that the record establishes that Johnson had scleroderma prior to and during the lookback period and that this disease caused the same symptoms\u2014joint pain and swelling, shortness of breath, persistent cough, digestive and gastrointestinal problems, and fatigue\u2014for which she repeatedly sought and received medical treatment beginning as early as October 2015 and continuing through the lookback period. In Reliance\u2019s view, Johnson therefore received medical treatment and diagnostic procedures 'for' (i.e., because of) scleroderma during the lookback period, even though neither she nor her providers knew that scleroderma was the underlying disease.",
          "Reliance points in particular to statements from Johnson\u2019s treating rheumatologist, Dr. Querubin, who indicated that her scleroderma symptoms began in October 2015 and that he treated her for those symptoms every one to three months, including during the lookback period. Reliance argues that this admission alone shows that scleroderma was a sickness for which Johnson received medical treatment within the lookback period, bringing it squarely within the policy\u2019s pre-existing condition exclusion.",
          "Reliance notes that Johnson underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and other diagnostic evaluations during the lookback period for complaints that include common scleroderma manifestations. It contends that these 'diagnostic procedures' were conducted because of, and thus 'for,' the underlying scleroderma, even if that diagnosis was not yet known. Reliance emphasizes that the policy\u2019s inclusion of 'diagnostic procedures' in the definition of Pre-Existing Condition underscores that a formal, contemporaneous diagnosis is not required.",
          "Reliance relies on the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s unpublished decision in Ferrizzi v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co. interpreting the same or nearly identical policy language. It argues that Ferrizzi confirms that the Reliance pre-existing condition exclusion does not require that the condition be formally diagnosed during the lookback period, and that treatment for symptoms caused by the later-diagnosed condition within the lookback period is sufficient. Reliance maintains that its interpretation here tracks the one that was accepted in Ferrizzi and thus is, at a minimum, a reasonable reading.",
          "Reliance further invokes decisions from other jurisdictions upholding application of pre-existing condition exclusions where the insured\u2019s later-diagnosed disease had manifested through symptoms and prompted treatment before coverage began, even if the disease had not been named or accurately diagnosed. It argues that pre-existing condition clauses are designed to protect insurers from adverse selection and fraudulent attempts to obtain coverage for already existing illnesses, and that tying the exclusion to whether a doctor happened to suspect the specific disease by name would undermine this purpose.",
          "On the standard of review, Reliance asserts that the policy expressly grants it discretionary authority to interpret the plan and determine eligibility for benefits, and thus the court must apply deferential arbitrary-and-capricious review. Under that standard, Reliance argues, its denial must be upheld if any reasonable basis in the record and in the policy language supports its conclusion that Johnson\u2019s disability is caused by or results from a pre-existing condition. It maintains that the medical evidence, Johnson\u2019s long history of the same symptoms attributable to scleroderma before the policy took effect, and the plan language collectively provide more than a reasonable basis for its decision."

The pre\u2011existing condition clause covers a sickness 'for which' the insured received treatment, consultation, care, services, diagnostic procedures, or took prescribed medicine during the lookback period. Johnson\u2019s treatment in that period was directed at a host of other diagnoses; no provider suspected or attempted to treat scleroderma, and the biopsy that revealed it occurred months later. Reading 'for which' in its ordinary sense\u2014as treatment directed at a particular sickness, not any undiscovered underlying cause\u2014fits the text ('Sickness or Injury,' not 'symptom') and avoids converting the clause into a sweeping 'preexisting symptom' exclusion that turns almost any pre\u2011coverage doctor visit into retroactive treatment 'for' a later\u2011named disease. Other circuits interpreting similar 'for which' language have required that treatment during the lookback period be aimed at, or at least tied in the provider\u2019s mind to, the condition itself, not merely generic symptoms later reattributed in hindsight. The insurer bears the burden on an exclusion, and ambiguity is resolved against it. On de novo review, treating scleroderma as a 'Pre\u2011Existing Condition' here is a misinterpretation of the policy language, so the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that the exclusion applied is wrong and must be reversed."

          "reasoning":"Even granting Reliance discretionary authority, its interpretation still must be reasonable. Reliance equates 'for which' with 'because of,' such that any pre\u2011coverage treatment of symptoms that are later recognized as manifestations of scleroderma becomes treatment 'for' scleroderma. That reading stretches the text, effectively rewriting a 'pre\u2011existing condition' exclusion into a far broader 'pre\u2011existing symptom' exclusion and divorcing coverage from what either the patient or providers understood or were attempting to treat. It makes coverage for chronic or hard\u2011to\u2011diagnose diseases illusory for the first year of coverage, contrary to the ordinary expectations created by the policy\u2019s wording and its focus on 'Sickness or Injury' rather than undiagnosed causes. It also renders the inclusion of 'diagnostic procedures' largely redundant if any symptom\u2011related test, no matter how misdirected, retroactively counts as testing 'for' the later\u2011identified disease. Given that no clinician suspected scleroderma during the lookback period, the record does not show that Johnson received treatment 'for' that condition within the meaning of the plan; at most it shows treatment for other illnesses and unexplained symptoms. Because Reliance\u2019s application of the exclusion depends on an unreasonable, overbroad construction of 'for which' that conflicts with the clause\u2019s text and structure and unduly favors the drafter on an exclusion it bears the burden to prove, its denial is arbitrary and capricious even under deferential review. Accordingly, the district court erred in upholding Reliance\u2019s decision and should be reversed."

Ferrizzi primarily rejected the idea that a formal diagnosis must occur in the lookback period, and involved a condition (substance abuse) that was actually suspected and treated as such during that period. Here, by contrast, no clinician suspected or treated scleroderma before the biopsy; they addressed different diagnoses. Extending Ferrizzi to hold that any treatment of nonspecific symptoms is treatment 'for' an undiscovered autoimmune disease would materially expand the pre\u2011existing condition exclusion beyond the text. Given both the factual distinctions and the limited persuasive force of an unpublished opinion, Ferrizzi does not render Reliance\u2019s interpretation reasonable in Johnson\u2019s materially different circumstances and does not salvage the denial.

      "reasoning":"The key dispute is how to read 'for which' in the pre\u2011existing condition definition when a serious disease pre\u2011dated coverage but was neither suspected nor treated as such during the lookback period. The policy\u2019s focus on treatment 'for' a 'Sickness or Injury,' the insurer\u2019s burden on exclusions, and analogous ERISA and insurance cases from other circuits support the view that treatment must be directed at the later\u2011identified condition, not merely at generic symptoms that in hindsight are attributable to that condition. Reliance\u2019s broader construction effectively turns the clause into a pre\u2011existing symptom exclusion, which stretches the text and threatens to nullify initial coverage for many chronic diseases. Under Blankenship step one, the district court\u2019s interpretation is wrong; under step three, Reliance\u2019s reading is outside the range of reasonable interpretations. The nonprecedential Ferrizzi decision is factually distinguishable\u2014there, the underlying condition was actually suspected and treated during the lookback period\u2014and cannot be read to compel or even strongly support Reliance\u2019s much more expansive hindsight theory here. Given these factors, the most likely outcome is that the appellate court reverses summary judgment for Reliance, holds that the pre\u2011existing condition limitation does not apply on this record, and remands with instructions to enter judgment in Johnson\u2019s favor on liability for benefits or to proceed consistent with that interpretation."

      "factual_background":"The Vermont Superior Court is the state\u2019s general trial court, operating through fourteen county-based units. Prior to March 2020, the Superior Court did not accept electronic filings. Civil complaints were filed on paper, and members of the public and the press could review newly filed paper complaints in person at courthouses. When access was requested, court staff conducted a quick file audit to confirm that confidential information (such as protected personal identifiers) was not in the publicly accessible file and removed any such information before the file was made available. In some instances, complaints were made publicly available before docketing was completed.\n\nIn 2020, the Vermont judiciary transitioned to an electronic case management system called Odyssey. By March 15, 2021, virtually all documents filed in the Superior Court were required to be submitted electronically. Under the electronic system, the press and public generally could review electronically filed documents only at designated public-access terminals in courthouses and judiciary offices during business hours, although the Court Administrator had discretion to allow certain civil case records to be accessed remotely.\n\nIn anticipation of this transition, Vermont adopted the 2020 Vermont Rules for Electronic Filing and amended the Vermont Rules for Public Access to Court Records. Under those rules, filers bear primary responsibility for protecting confidential information from public disclosure: they must verify and certify that filings do not contain unredacted confidential personal or financial information. If a filing is noncompliant, a clerk may withhold public access, redact the filing, reject it entirely, or refer it to a judge for potential sanctions or professional discipline.\n\nAs implemented in practice, the Superior Court adopted a pre-access review process for newly filed civil complaints. Before allowing public access to a new electronic complaint, a court clerk would review the complaint (and associated filings) to check for unredacted confidential personal or financial information exempt from disclosure (such as social security numbers or financial account numbers), verify that the complaint was signed, ensure that the correct filing codes, fees, and case type had been used, and confirm that no comments or notes from the filer that were not intended as part of the complaint (\"filers\u2019 notes\") appeared on the public-facing document. Only after this review was completed would the complaint be made available to the public at courthouse terminals.\n\nThe record indicated that the rules-based system, which placed primary responsibility on filers and provided for clerk review and sanctions, was largely successful at preventing improper disclosure of confidential information. During the approximately sixteen\u2011month period examined at trial, out of 4,156 civil complaints filed, only three exhibits associated with two complaints were rejected for containing confidential information, a rejection rate of 0.048% for complaints themselves. Across all types of filings (not limited to complaints), 138 filings were rejected for revelation of confidential information during the same period, showing that at least some improper submissions were being detected and blocked.\n\nHowever, the manual pre-access review process caused delays between the time complaints were electronically submitted and the time they became available to the public and press. For the 4,156 complaints filed between the various units\u2019 transition to electronic filing and August 6, 2021 (the last date for which pretrial data was produced), 54.8% were made available to the public on the day of filing, 22.6% on the next day, 4.6% two days after filing, 6.7% three days after filing, and 11.4% four or more days after filing. The delays varied significantly among county units. Over the full period, the percentage of newly filed civil complaints made available on the day of filing ranged from 3.8% in Essex County to 81.6% in Windham County. Week\u2011to\u2011week variation was also substantial: in some weeks no newly filed complaints were available on the day of filing, while in another week 91.7% were released the same day.\n\nThe Superior Court\u2019s transition to Odyssey coincided with the COVID\u201119 pandemic. During this period, the court system experienced staffing and equipment challenges, high employee attrition, and difficulties in hiring, all of which were identified as likely contributing factors to the delays in completing pre-access review and making complaints available to the public.\n\nIn July 2021, Vermont began piloting a new centralized pre-access review program for civil cases. Instead of having each county\u2019s staff review only that county\u2019s complaints, a centralized team began reviewing all complaints statewide. Between July 12 and July 19, 2021, five county units (Chittenden, Essex, Caledonia, Rutland, and Orleans) began using the centralized review team. The centralization was in its early stages and only partially implemented when the trial record closed. In a post\u2011trial supplemental submission covering July 26 to September 26, 2021, defendants\u2019 expert reported that, after partial centralization, 67% of complaints were made available the same day they were filed and 95% within one business day, an apparent improvement over the earlier period, though the submission did not specify when the remaining 5% were made public.\n\nReporters employed by the plaintiff media organizations routinely monitor newly filed Superior Court complaints to identify newsworthy cases and provide timely coverage. Plaintiffs alleged that delays caused by Vermont\u2019s pre-access review policy impaired their ability to report on new civil cases while they were still newsworthy, thereby harming their news-gathering activities and the public\u2019s access to information about court proceedings.",

The court concluded that the First Amendment provides a qualified right of public access to newly filed civil complaints and that this right attaches upon filing. Applying the Press\u2011Enterprise II framework and related Second Circuit precedents, the court determined that the Superior Court\u2019s pre-access review process, as implemented during the period in the record, infringed plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment right of access because the delays imposed were not adequately justified and not narrowly tailored to any sufficient interest. The court entered a permanent injunction that barred defendants \"from prohibiting public access to newly filed civil complaints which have not been designated confidential by the filer until the Vermont Superior Court has completed a pre-access review process.\" The district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory relief, reasoning that a declaratory judgment would add nothing to the relief already afforded by the injunction.",

          "legal_standard":"Article III mootness requires a live case or controversy at all stages of litigation. A claim becomes moot if subsequent events make it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief. When a defendant voluntarily ceases the challenged conduct, the case is not moot unless it is absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior cannot reasonably be expected to recur, and that interim improvements completely and durably remedy the alleged violation. Under Press-Enterprise II, the state still bears the burden to show that any remaining delays are justified by a higher value and that procedures are narrowly tailored; improved performance metrics alone do not necessarily moot claims if the challenged policy or aspects of it remain in effect."

          "The pre-access review process serves an important and constitutionally cognizable interest\u2014protecting the privacy and security of litigants and third parties by preventing public disclosure of confidential personal and financial information that could facilitate fraud, identity theft, or other serious harms. This interest constitutes a \"higher value\" or overriding interest under Press-Enterprise II that can justify some delay in public access.",
          "The delays imposed by the pre-access review process were relatively minimal and reasonable in light of that interest and the practical constraints faced by the Vermont courts during a system-wide transition to electronic filing amid the COVID\u201119 pandemic. During the trial evidence period, 54.8% of complaints were available the day of filing and 77.4% within one day, and subsequent centralization increased this to approximately 67% same-day and 95% within one business day. Appellants contend that a delay of no more than one business day for the vast majority of complaints is slight and does not impermissibly burden the First Amendment.",
          "Checks for technical compliance\u2014such as verifying signatures, codes, fees, case type, and the absence of filers\u2019 notes\u2014are largely incidental to and integrated with the review for confidential information, and there is no evidence that these additional checks materially extended the time needed to complete pre-access review. Historically, clerks also performed cursory checks (for example, verifying a signature) before making paper complaints available.",
          "The Press-Enterprise II standard applied by the district court was, in practice, overly strict; appellants argue that reasonable delays associated with court administration should be analyzed analogously to time, place, and manner restrictions under intermediate scrutiny, not a form of strict scrutiny, particularly where the state is managing its own judicial records and balancing logistical realities with transparency.",
          "Even if Press-Enterprise II applies, appellants argue that the pre-access review process was narrowly tailored. It was designed to protect confidential information without eliminating public access, and delays were largely attributable to temporary implementation challenges and resource constraints during rollout of Odyssey and the pandemic, not to any intent to restrict access.",
          "The permanent injunction is overbroad and effectively requires instantaneous public access to all nonconfidential complaints upon filing, prohibiting any pre-access review no matter how brief, efficient, or justified. Appellants contend that the trial record does not support such a sweeping remedy, especially in light of Vermont\u2019s ongoing improvements, and that the injunction impermissibly restricts the state judiciary\u2019s ability to run a constitutionally compliant pre-access review system.",
          "Appellants further assert that the district court should have abstained under O\u2019Shea\/Younger principles. They argue that federal injunctive relief dictating how state courts manage the timing and content of access to their own records intrudes into core state judicial functions and risks ongoing federal supervision of state court administration, the type of interference that abstention doctrine seeks to avoid.",
          "Regarding mootness, appellants argue that by the time of judgment, their partially implemented centralized review system had substantially reduced delays (with 95% of complaints available within one business day) and that this change in practice, undertaken in good faith, eliminated any ongoing constitutional violation and any need for injunctive relief. They maintain that there is no reasonable likelihood that the courts would revert to earlier, less efficient practices, rendering the case moot."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "Plaintiffs argue that civil complaints have historically been open to the public upon filing and that immediate access plays a crucial role in public understanding of judicial proceedings, court accountability, and coverage of matters of public concern. Under Bernstein and Lugosch, a presumptive First Amendment right of access attaches to civil complaints at the moment of filing, and the press, as the public\u2019s surrogate, enjoys coextensive rights.",
          "Plaintiffs contend that the Vermont Superior Court\u2019s practice of withholding new complaints until after pre-access review imposed substantial and unjustified delays that undermined this right. Approximately 45% of complaints were not available on the day of filing; more than 11% were not available until four or more days after filing, with some county units and weeks showing even more severe delays. Plaintiffs maintain that such delays materially impair their ability to report news while it is still timely and of greatest public interest.",
          "They argue that the state failed to carry its burden under Press-Enterprise II to show that the delays were essential to preserve a higher value and narrowly tailored to that end. While acknowledging that protecting confidential information is an important governmental interest, plaintiffs emphasize that Vermont already placed primary responsibility on filers to redact such information and that, in practice, very few complaints (only two complaints out of 4,156) were found to contain unredacted confidential information. They assert that this low incidence does not justify systematic delays for all complaints.",
          "Plaintiffs further argue that substantial portions of the pre-access review were devoted not to confidentiality but to verifying signatures, technical compliance, and the presence of filers\u2019 notes\u2014objectives that, they contend, do not qualify as \"higher values\" under Press-Enterprise II and do not require delaying public access. According to plaintiffs, any necessary correction or rejection of technically deficient complaints can occur after the public and press have been allowed to view the filed document, without creating the kinds of harms (such as identity theft) that might support a delay.",
          "They highlight county-by-county disparities (for example, 81.6% same-day access in Windham County versus 3.8% in Essex County) and week-to-week fluctuations, arguing that these disparities show the delays were at least partly the result of administrative priorities and resource allocation rather than inherent necessities of the review for confidential information. Plaintiffs contend that this undercuts any claim that the delays were narrowly tailored or unavoidable.",
          "Plaintiffs point to the later centralization pilot and its reported improved timelines as evidence that materially faster, more efficient review was feasible. They argue that if Vermont could, through administrative changes, achieve substantially better timeliness, then the earlier practice was not narrowly tailored and imposed unnecessary burdens on First Amendment rights.",
          "Regarding the remedy, plaintiffs maintain that a strong injunction was warranted because the record showed a systemic practice of pre-access withholding that adversely affected their ability to report on new filings. They argue that without injunctive relief, Vermont courts could revert to prior practices or adopt only marginally different procedures that continue to impose unconstitutional delays.",
          "On abstention, plaintiffs argue that their suit does not ask the federal courts to supervise or audit ongoing state adjudications but instead challenges a generally applicable administrative policy governing public access to court records. They contend that deciding the constitutionality of such a policy is within the ordinary role of federal courts and does not present the kind of interference with specific state proceedings that Younger or O\u2019Shea are designed to prevent, especially in light of the significant First Amendment interests at stake.",
          "On mootness, plaintiffs assert that the case remained live because the challenged pre-access review policy was still in place, and Vermont had not permanently abandoned or repudiated the practice of delaying access pending review. They emphasize that partial improvements in performance metrics, implemented during litigation and unsupported by binding policy changes, do not satisfy the stringent standards for voluntary cessation, nor do they resolve the underlying constitutional questions about which objectives may justify delay and how tailored any review process must be."

The Second Circuit\u2019s own precedents (Lugosch, Bernstein) strongly support a First Amendment right of access to civil complaints upon filing. The record shows that a substantial percentage of complaints were not available the same day, with more than 11% delayed four or more days and extreme county-by-county disparity. Vermont bears the burden to justify these delays as essential to preserving a higher value and to show narrow tailoring. Although protection of confidential identifiers is an important interest, (1) the rules already place primary responsibility on filers, (2) only a vanishingly small number of complaints themselves were found to contain confidential information, and (3) much of the review was for technical\/administrative purposes not qualifying as a \u2018higher value.\u2019 The large variation across counties and the later improvements after centralization demonstrate that faster, less burdensome systems were feasible, undermining the claim of narrow tailoring.

The district court enjoined defendants from prohibiting public access to nonconfidential complaints \u2018until\u2019 completion of any pre-access review\u2014effectively barring any screening for confidential information prior to public release. That remedy goes beyond requiring constitutionally adequate timeliness and instead forecloses even brief, well-tailored pre-access review that could be justified by the strong privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of social security numbers and financial account data. Press-Enterprise II requires that restrictions be narrowly tailored, not that they be eliminated altogether. The record also shows that Vermont\u2019s later centralized system achieved same-day or next-business-day review for the vast majority of complaints, suggesting that a system permitting modest, defined delays to protect privacy can be consistent with the First Amendment. By categorically prohibiting pre-access review of nonconfidential complaints, the injunction is broader than necessary to cure the constitutional violation and unduly intrudes on state court administration. The appellate court is likely to hold that, while a violation occurred, the remedy exceeded the proper scope and therefore constituted an abuse of discretion, warranting vacatur or narrowing of the injunction."

Here, plaintiffs mount a facial\/structural First Amendment challenge to a generally applicable administrative policy governing when newly filed complaints become available at public terminals. The requested relief does not target any particular ongoing case, would not enjoin prosecutions or civil enforcement actions, and does not require federal monitoring of individual state proceedings; it addresses system-wide access rules. Second Circuit and Supreme Court doctrine emphasize the \u2018virtually unflagging obligation\u2019 to exercise jurisdiction in such circumstances.

Here, the underlying policy\u2014pre-access withholding of complaints pending clerk review\u2014remained in place; only the implementation changed and only partially, with some complaints still experiencing unspecified delays. The changes were made unilaterally during litigation and were not cemented by any binding legal reforms, leaving open the possibility of reversion or continuation of unconstitutional delays. Moreover, the core legal controversy\u2014what delay, if any, is constitutionally permissible under Press-Enterprise II\u2014remains unresolved by incremental performance improvements. On these facts, the stringent standard for mootness by voluntary cessation is not met, so the district court properly rejected the mootness argument."

      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",

      "reasoning":"Applying Second Circuit First Amendment access precedents, the appellate court is likely to agree that a qualified right of access attaches to civil complaints upon filing and that Vermont\u2019s demonstrated delays during the relevant period\u2014often extending multiple days and varying dramatically across counties\u2014were not justified as narrowly tailored to any overriding interest. That supports affirmance on the merits of the constitutional violation (issue 1). The court is also likely to uphold the district court\u2019s refusal to abstain (issue 3) and its rejection of mootness (issue 4), because the case challenges a general administrative policy, not discrete ongoing prosecutions, and the State\u2019s mid-litigation adjustments do not satisfy the stringent voluntary-cessation standard. However, the permanent injunction\u2019s categorical prohibition on any pre-access review of nonconfidential complaints likely overreaches: it effectively requires immediate public access at filing and prevents the State from conducting even brief, justified screening for confidential identifiers before public release. That broad remedy is not narrowly tailored to the proven wrong and unduly intrudes on state court administration, leading to a conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in crafting the injunction. The most probable appellate disposition is therefore a mixed outcome: affirmance on liability, abstention, and mootness, but reversal (or vacatur and remand) as to the scope of injunctive relief."

      "factual_background":"Advanced Analytics, Inc. (AAI) is associated with Dr. Xiaolu Wang, who developed a proprietary numerical sequence referred to as the \"ACE Numbers.\" During the 1990s, AAI and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (CGMI) engaged in licensing negotiations concerning AAI's technology. AAI contends that these negotiations were unsuccessful but that, during the process, CGMI obtained access to the ACE Numbers under a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). AAI alleges that CGMI, instead of licensing AAI's technology, misappropriated the ACE Numbers and subsequently incorporated elements of that proprietary numerical sequence into its own financial software product known as The Yield Book (TYB). According to AAI, TYB then generated significant profits for CGMI and TYB without any compensation to AAI.\n\nAAI maintains that CGMI's use of its software and data under the NDA was limited to evaluation and testing, and that CGMI was obligated not to disclose or use AAI's proprietary information beyond that purpose. AAI further alleges that CGMI retained at least one report generated during testing of the ACE Numbers in violation of the NDA. CGMI, by contrast, produced evidence that its own sequences and software used in TYB were independently developed and not derived from AAI's ACE Numbers.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"AAI brought claims against CGMI and TYB including: (1) misappropriation of trade secrets based on alleged use of the ACE Numbers in Defendants' software; (2) breach of contract, based primarily on alleged violations of the nondisclosure agreement (NDA) governing the parties' dealings and restrictions on use and retention of AAI's materials; (3) breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing; (4) quantum meruit; and (5) unjust enrichment. Defendants asserted counterclaims, including a counterclaim seeking attorneys' fees and costs under the NDA's prevailing-party provision.\n\nThe litigation extended for nearly twenty years and involved two rounds of discovery spanning approximately five years. AAI retained an expert, Dr. Jianqing Fan, who submitted multiple declarations and reports regarding alleged similarities or derivation between Defendants' sequences and the ACE Numbers. One of these, the so\u2011called \"Fourth Fan Declaration,\" was filed with AAI's opposition to CGMI's summary judgment motion.",
        "district_court_decision":"After extensive discovery, the district court concluded that CGMI had submitted unrebutted evidence that the sequences and software used in TYB were independently developed and not derived from AAI's ACE Numbers. The court found that AAI had failed to introduce admissible evidence showing that Defendants' software incorporated or was derived from the ACE Numbers and held that AAI had not met its prima facie burden on the \"use\" or \"derivation\" element of its trade secret misappropriation claim. On that basis, the district court granted partial summary judgment to Defendants on AAI's misappropriation of trade secrets claim. For the same basic reasons, it granted summary judgment to Defendants on AAI's related breach of contract, good faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment claims, all of which were premised on the same alleged misappropriation and use of the ACE Numbers.\n\nSeparately, the district court found that CGMI had breached the NDA in a limited manner by retaining a report generated during the testing of the ACE Numbers, in violation of the agreement's restrictions. However, the court determined that AAI had failed to identify evidence quantifying any damages specifically resulting from this limited breach, even after the court allowed AAI additional time and opportunity to conduct discovery focused on damages. Concluding that AAI had not produced evidence of actual or consequential damages from the retention of the report, the district court awarded only nominal damages on that limited breach of contract claim.\n\nIn addition, the district court addressed a number of discovery disputes. It rejected AAI's assertions that Defendants had engaged in discovery misconduct, such as withholding or fabricating crucial evidence. It denied several of AAI's requests for further discovery, finding them unsupported and speculative in light of the extensive discovery already conducted. It also struck the Fourth Fan Declaration as untimely and because it relied on a previously stricken expert report. Subsequent orders allowed AAI to use objective descriptions of record evidence drawn from that declaration in its briefing, but the expert opinions in the declaration were excluded from consideration on the merits.\n\nUnder the NDA's attorneys' fees provision, which entitles the \"prevailing party\" in litigation arising out of the agreement to recover court costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees, the district court granted Defendants' counterclaim for attorneys' fees and costs. The court reasoned that, although AAI had succeeded on a limited NDA breach claim resulting in nominal damages, that claim was a relatively insignificant part of the case, whereas Defendants had prevailed on the central, high\u2011value claims for misappropriation and related contract and quasi\u2011contract theories.\n\nThe district court also denied several motions by AAI to reconsider its discovery rulings and its summary judgment and damages decisions.",
        "what_is_appealed":"AAI appeals multiple aspects of the district court's November 5, 2021 judgment and related orders. Specifically, AAI challenges: (1) the district court's discovery rulings, including the rejection of AAI's allegations of discovery misconduct by Defendants, the denial of AAI's requests for additional discovery, and the exclusion (striking) of the Fourth Fan Declaration; (2) the grant of summary judgment to Defendants on AAI's misappropriation of trade secrets claim and the associated breach of contract, good faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment claims premised on alleged misappropriation and use of the ACE Numbers; (3) the district court's decision to award only nominal damages on the limited breach of the NDA, rather than submitting the damages issue to a jury; and (4) the grant of Defendants' counterclaim for attorneys' fees and costs under the NDA on the basis that Defendants were the prevailing party.

      "factual_background":"Elizabeth F. Warner began working for the United States Postal Service in 1998. She became a postmaster in 2007 and by 2018 held a Level 18 postmaster position. In January 2018, at age 58, she applied for a higher-level, Level 20 postmaster position in Durham, New Hampshire, which would have provided higher pay and better benefits. Her supervisor, Kathleen Hayes, who was the Post Office Operations Manager for the Northern New England District, interviewed her for the Durham position. Warner was not selected; instead, the job went to John Minigan, a 36-year-old man. According to the district court\u2019s paraphrase, Hayes told Warner she chose Minigan because he had more experience of the sort needed for that particular job.\n\nSeven months later, in August 2018, Warner applied for another Level 20 postmaster position, this time in Somersworth, New Hampshire. Hayes again conducted the interview. During this interview, Hayes stated that the Somersworth post office had never had a female postmaster and said she wondered how that would work. Hayes also questioned whether Warner had the energy to manage the Somersworth office. Warner was again not selected. Hayes chose David Adams, a 53-year-old man, for the position.\n\nWarner believed she was denied both promotions because of her age and sex. She asserts that she had extensive experience with city delivery, including service on a City Inspection Team and years of experience managing city delivery, including in Durham. She also points to her employee evaluations, which she characterizes as lacking negative feedback related to city-delivery performance. USPS, in contrast, characterizes Minigan as considered a leader in city delivery who had worked on many special teams as a team leader for city delivery inspections and had instructed many trainings for city delivery. As to Adams, the record reflects that he had been postmaster in South Berwick, an office with 100% city delivery, and had previously supervised the Portsmouth post office, which was the largest office in Hayes\u2019s group and had 20\u201330 city delivery routes.\n\nWarner also relies on statements and data relating to Hayes. She notes Hayes\u2019s comments during the Somersworth interview about Somersworth never having a female postmaster and Hayes wondering how that would work, and about whether Warner had the energy for the position. Warner further points to USPS data showing Hayes had promoted more men than women over her career and to testimony that, in a 2020 meeting, Hayes referred to six young male employees as her \"smoking hot\" Officers in Charge. Warner also identifies various inconsistencies or gaps in Hayes\u2019s statements, including an initial (later corrected) assertion that Hayes herself had never been investigated for discrimination, difficulty recalling certain meetings and details of Warner\u2019s city-delivery experience, and an apparent discrepancy over whether Hayes interviewed Adams for the Somersworth role and the absence of interview notes or matrices for Adams. During the EEO investigation, Hayes stated in an email that she did not interview Adams, though elsewhere in the record she is described as having spoken with him in connection with the selection; Warner did not ultimately pursue an argument on appeal that the interview did not occur.",

She then filed a formal discrimination complaint with the USPS National EEO Investigative Services Office on December 21, 2018, and requested a formal hearing and investigation before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). She later withdrew her EEOC discrimination charge, after which the EEOC dismissed her case. Warner then filed suit in federal district court against USPS, alleging that USPS discriminated against her in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, based on age and sex, in connection with the two denied promotions.",
        "district_court_decision":"After discovery, USPS moved for summary judgment, contending that Warner\u2019s claims failed as a matter of law. The district court applied the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework to both the ADEA and Title VII claims. As to the age-discrimination claims under the ADEA, the court found that Warner had established a prima facie case but concluded that USPS had articulated legitimate and nondiscriminatory reasons for selecting Minigan and Adams over Warner\u2014namely, that they had more experience of the type needed (overseeing city delivery routes), were better organized, presented themselves more impressively in their interviews, and had demonstrated superior leadership skills. The court further found that no reasonable jury could conclude that these reasons were pretexts for discrimination, determining that Warner\u2019s evidence showed neither pretext nor discriminatory animus. It therefore granted summary judgment against Warner on all counts, including her age-discrimination claims and her sex-discrimination claims related to both the Durham and Somersworth promotion decisions.",

In federal-sector ADEA cases, the Supreme Court in Babb v. Wilkie stated that a plaintiff need only show that age discrimination played any part in the way a decision was made (i.e., that the decision was tainted by age). At summary judgment, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and determine whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact.

That disagreement with the employer\u2019s assessment, without more, does not show pretext.

The inconsistencies Warner points to (Hayes\u2019s difficulty recalling events, correction about prior investigations, confusion about whether she interviewed Adams) are peripheral to the core qualifications rationale and do not show that Hayes knowingly advanced a false explanation.

Appellate courts frequently treat such choices as binding and decline to let a party re\u2011frame the governing legal standard on appeal after inviting the asserted error below.

That is a facially legitimate basis for selection. The later Somersworth remarks cannot reasonably be read as contemporaneous evidence that the earlier Durham decision was motivated by sex, and the \u201csmoking hot\u201d comment in 2020 is both remote and, standing alone, not strong evidence that the 2018 Durham decision was sex\u2011based.

A reasonable jury could interpret that as expressing doubt about a woman\u2019s suitability for the role rather than merely noting community attitudes. Unlike a stray remark, it was made by the decisionmaker in the decision\u2011making context and about the very protected characteristic at issue. Coupled with the selection of a male candidate, the contemporaneous \u2018energy\u2019 comment (which, in this sex\u2011bias context, could be heard as gender\u2011stereotyping rather than age\u2011coding), the pattern data showing substantially more male than female promotions by Hayes, and the 2020 \u201csmoking hot\u201d remark evidencing a preference for young men, there is enough circumstantial \u201cmosaic\u201d for a jury to infer that sex played a role and that the stated reliance on city\u2011delivery experience and interview performance was at least partially pretextual. While USPS offers strong qualifications evidence for Adams, pretext need not be proven by showing the plaintiff was clearly better qualified; it is enough if a jury could view the explanation as masking discriminatory motives.

Under the OEM, Fusion was allowed to resell Barracuda\u2019s email archiving services to Fusion\u2019s own customers. The OEM required Fusion to include certain limitation-of-liability and indemnification provisions in its customer contracts as a condition of the OEM. The OEM also reserved to Barracuda the right to audit Fusion\u2019s books and records relating to services provided by Barracuda, and contained an anti\u2011waiver clause stating that no failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under the OEM would operate as a waiver of that right. \n\nAfter the OEM was executed, Zoll Medical Corporation and its subsidiary Zoll Services LLC (collectively, Zoll) became a Fusion customer.

The contract between Fusion and Zoll (the Hosting Agreement) did not include the limitation-of-liability or indemnification provisions required by the OEM.

In an earlier order, the district court dismissed most of Zoll\u2019s and Fusion\u2019s claims but allowed three to go forward: (1) Zoll\u2019s claim for equitable indemnification against Barracuda (relating to Zoll\u2019s settlement and liability to its customers following the data breach); (2) Fusion\u2019s claim against Barracuda for breach of contract under the OEM (alleging failure to provide data\u2011hosting services that properly protected PHI); and (3) Fusion\u2019s claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the OEM. The district court also held at the motion\u2011to\u2011dismiss stage that Fusion had failed to satisfy a condition precedent in the OEM, because Fusion did not include the OEM\u2011required limitation\u2011of\u2011liability\/indemnity language in its customer contracts. Axis did not later dispute that failure of condition precedent on appeal, but argued that Barracuda had waived or was estopped from relying on it.",
        "district_court_decision":"After arbitration and settlements among Zoll and Fusion, Zoll and Fusion\u2019s remaining claims against Barracuda were assigned to Axis, Fusion\u2019s insurer. In 2022, Axis was substituted as plaintiff. Following discovery, Barracuda moved for summary judgment on all surviving claims. The district court concluded, with respect to Zoll\u2019s equitable indemnification claim, that Zoll\u2019s relationship with Barracuda was, at most, that of an independent contractor and that this did not establish the kind of derivative or vicarious relationship required under Massachusetts law for equitable indemnification. Regarding Fusion\u2019s breach of contract claim, the court found that Fusion had not complied with the OEM\u2019s condition precedent (the required limitation\u2011of\u2011liability\/indemnity provisions in customer contracts) and that Barracuda had neither waived that condition precedent nor was estopped from relying on it. For the good\u2011faith\u2011and\u2011fair\u2011dealing claim, the court determined that Axis had not shown any contractual right held by Fusion under the OEM that would be triggered in the event of a data breach, and therefore the implied covenant could not be used to create such a right or to expand the contract beyond its terms. On these grounds, the district court granted Barracuda\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all three surviving claims.",

Axis contends that vicarious or derivative liability does not strictly depend on labels such as employer, principal, or independent contractor, but on whether the facts show that Zoll was held derivatively or vicariously liable for Barracuda\u2019s conduct in connection with the data breach and the resulting class action settlement.",
          "Axis asserts that Massachusetts case law on indemnity, including Decker and its progeny, should not be read as limiting equitable indemnification strictly to a closed set of formal relationships.

          "On the breach of contract claim, Axis maintains that summary judgment was improper because waiver of a condition precedent is typically a question of fact for the jury. Axis argues that Barracuda\u2019s failure, over years, to exercise its contractual right under the OEM to audit Fusion\u2019s books, records, and customer contracts, despite knowing such an audit right existed, could reasonably be viewed as impliedly waiving the condition precedent requiring Fusion to include specified limitation\u2011of\u2011liability\/indemnity provisions in its customer contracts. Axis characterizes its evidence as providing at least some reasonable factual support so as to create a genuine issue for trial.",
          "Axis further argues that Barracuda should be equitably estopped from invoking the OEM\u2019s condition precedent to defeat Fusion\u2019s breach of contract claim. It contends that Barracuda\u2019s prolonged silence and failure to audit Fusion\u2019s customer contracts amounted to a \"representation\" by conduct that Fusion\u2019s contracts were acceptable or that Barracuda would not insist on strict compliance. According to Axis, Fusion reasonably relied on Barracuda\u2019s inaction in believing it was in compliance with the OEM\u2019s terms, and suffered detriment when Barracuda later invoked non\u2011compliance with the condition precedent as a defense.",
          "Regarding the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Axis asserts that there is substantial evidence that Barracuda deprived Fusion of the benefit of its contractual bargain under the OEM. Axis contends that Barracuda\u2019s conduct in connection with the data breach and its aftermath\u2014including being slow to provide information about the breach, providing information in difficult-to-use formats, interfering with Zoll\u2019s investigators\u2019 efforts to determine the cause of the breach, and misrepresenting certain details about the breach\u2014amounted to bad faith. Axis argues that these acts frustrated the purpose of the OEM by undermining Fusion\u2019s ability to effectively resell Barracuda\u2019s services and manage the fallout from the breach, thereby injuring Fusion\u2019s contractual interests."

          "On equitable indemnification, Barracuda argues that Massachusetts law limits equitable indemnity to situations where the would\u2011be indemnitee is held derivatively or vicariously liable for the acts of another, and that such liability arises only in specific kinds of legally recognized relationships, such as employer\u2011employee, principal\u2011agent, manufacturer\u2011retailer, or certain independent-contractor relationships. Barracuda contends that there is no evidence that Zoll and Barracuda were in such a relationship. The only contracts in the record describe independent contractor relationships between (a) Barracuda and Fusion (the OEM) and (b) Fusion and Zoll (the Hosting Agreement), with no contract directly between Zoll and Barracuda. Barracuda maintains that the independent\u2011contractor status, especially with the added step of Fusion as intermediary, cannot by itself create derivative or vicarious liability necessary for equitable indemnification.",
          "Barracuda relies on Massachusetts precedents, including Decker, Elias, and related cases, as establishing that equitable indemnification is strictly limited to situations of derivative or vicarious liability grounded in recognized legal relationships, and that nothing in the record suggests Zoll was legally responsible for Barracuda\u2019s conduct under such a relationship.",
          "On the breach of contract claim, Barracuda emphasizes that Fusion failed to satisfy the OEM\u2019s condition precedent requiring Fusion to include certain limitation\u2011of\u2011liability and indemnity language in its customer contracts, including Zoll\u2019s Hosting Agreement. Barracuda argues that, because this condition was unsatisfied, Fusion (and Axis as assignee\/subrogee) cannot seek to enforce the OEM liability against Barracuda absent a valid waiver or estoppel, neither of which Axis has shown with sufficient evidence.",
          "Regarding waiver, Barracuda contends that its failure to exercise its contractual audit right does not amount to an intentional relinquishment of the condition precedent. Under Massachusetts law, waiver requires clear, decisive, and unequivocal conduct, and mere silence, acquiescence, or inaction is inadequate where there is no duty to act. Barracuda asserts that the OEM gave it a right, but not an obligation, to audit Fusion\u2019s books and records, and that declining to exercise that right is equally consistent with preserving, not waiving, its contractual protections. Barracuda also points to the OEM\u2019s anti\u2011waiver clause, which states that failure or delay in exercising a contractual right does not constitute a waiver, as evidence of its intention not to waive the condition.",
          "On estoppel, Barracuda argues that Axis cannot satisfy the elements of equitable estoppel. Barracuda maintains that it made no representation to Fusion that could reasonably be interpreted as indicating that Fusion was in compliance with the OEM\u2019s condition precedent, and that its inaction did not occur in circumstances creating a duty to speak or act. Without a duty to act, Barracuda asserts, its silence cannot form the basis for estoppel. Moreover, Barracuda maintains that under the OEM it was Fusion\u2019s responsibility\u2014not Barracuda\u2019s\u2014to ensure that its customer contracts contained the required provisions, and Fusion could not reasonably rely on Barracuda\u2019s non\u2011use of its audit rights as an assurance of compliance.",
          "On the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Barracuda argues that Axis has failed to identify any specific contractual right or benefit in the OEM that Fusion was entitled to in the event of a data breach, such as a contractual obligation on Barracuda\u2019s part to provide certain information or assistance. Barracuda maintains that the OEM essentially created a non\u2011exclusive license allowing Fusion to market and resell Barracuda\u2019s email services, and did not include special protections or remedies for Fusion in the event of a breach. Because the implied covenant cannot be used to create new, unbargained-for rights or duties, Barracuda contends that Axis\u2019s claim improperly seeks to expand the OEM beyond its terms. Barracuda also disputes that its conduct shows bad faith toward Fusion, highlighting testimony that Fusion did not request the breach\u2011related data in any particular format and that JSON was a standard, machine\u2011readable format that Fusion\u2019s witnesses acknowledged was not difficult to decode."

Here, Zoll had no contract with Barracuda; the only contracts were (1) OEM: Barracuda\u2013Fusion, and (2) Hosting\/BAA: Fusion\u2013Zoll. The record characterizes both relationships as independent contractors, with Fusion as intermediary, and there is no showing that Massachusetts law would treat Zoll as vicariously liable for Barracuda\u2019s acts based on this chain. Zoll\u2019s liability to its customers arose from its own contractual and statutory duties to protect PHI and from its own settlement, not from a legal rule making it automatically responsible for Barracuda\u2019s conduct. Massachusetts precedent (e.g., Decker and progeny) is read narrowly and the appellate court is unlikely to expand equitable indemnity to this three-party reseller arrangement absent a directly recognized vicarious-liability relationship. Axis\u2019s argument that labels should be ignored and that \u2018derivative\u2019 should be read functionally is too broad and would effectively erase the Massachusetts limitation of equitable indemnity to special relationships. On these facts, there is no genuine dispute that the requisite derivative\/vicarious relationship is absent, so summary judgment is properly affirmed."

          "reasoning":"The breach-of-contract ruling at summary judgment is reviewed de novo. It is undisputed that Fusion failed to satisfy the OEM\u2019s clear condition precedent: including specified limitation-of-liability\/indemnity language in its customer contracts, including Zoll\u2019s. Under Massachusetts law, a party who has not satisfied a condition precedent generally cannot enforce the relevant contractual obligation unless there is waiver or estoppel. \n\nOn waiver, Massachusetts requires conduct that is clear, decisive, and unequivocal in manifesting an intent to relinquish a known contractual right. Barracuda merely did not exercise a discretionary audit right; the OEM gave Barracuda the right, but not the duty, to audit. Nonuse of an optional audit right is fully consistent with preserving, not abandoning, the condition precedent. The OEM also contains an express anti\u2011waiver provision stating that failure or delay in exercising a right does not constitute a waiver. Given that clause, Axis\u2019s theory that prolonged inaction alone constitutes waiver is particularly weak. Courts applying Massachusetts law are reluctant to infer waiver contrary to such a clause without some affirmative conduct indicating an intentional relinquishment; Axis points to none. \n\nOn estoppel, Axis must show (1) a representation or conduct amounting to a representation, (2) reasonable reliance, and (3) detriment. Silence can suffice only where there is a duty to speak. Here, Barracuda had no contractual duty to monitor Fusion\u2019s compliance or to exercise its audit rights. The OEM unambiguously put responsibility on Fusion to include the required provisions in its customer contracts. Barracuda\u2019s failure to audit or object, in the absence of any duty to act, is not a representation that Fusion was in compliance. Nor could Fusion reasonably rely on Barracuda\u2019s silence as an assurance that its contracts conformed to the OEM. Without a duty to speak and without some affirmative misleading conduct, estoppel fails as a matter of law. Accordingly, there is no genuine issue of material fact on waiver or estoppel, and the grant of summary judgment on Fusion\u2019s contract claim should be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"The implied-covenant ruling on summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Under Massachusetts law, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing protects the parties\u2019 reasonably expected benefits under the contract but cannot be used to create new, unbargained-for rights or duties or to rewrite the agreement. The claimant must identify a specific contractual benefit and show that the other party acted in bad faith to deprive it of that benefit. \n\nThe OEM essentially grants Fusion a nonexclusive license\/reseller right to market and resell Barracuda\u2019s email archiving services on stated terms, including pricing and certain limitations. Axis does not identify any OEM provision giving Fusion particular rights in the event of a security incident (e.g., rights to detailed forensics, specified cooperation obligations, or particular formats of data). The asserted misconduct\u2014slow or incomplete information about the breach, difficult data formats, interference with investigators, alleged misrepresentations\u2014might sound like tort or regulatory grievances, but they are not linked to a defined contractual benefit that the OEM promised Fusion in breach situations. To treat these as violations of the covenant would effectively create post-breach information and cooperation duties that the parties did not include in the OEM. Massachusetts courts are clear that the implied covenant cannot be used that way. \n\nEven assuming some general expectation that Barracuda would not affirmatively sabotage Fusion\u2019s business, the record (including that JSON data is a standard and decodable format and that Fusion did not specify a format) does not show the sort of bad-faith conduct aimed at depriving Fusion of a bargained-for contractual fruit; at most it shows imperfect post-breach behavior in an area not governed by the OEM. Because Axis has not tied its allegations to a particular contractual right or benefit and instead seeks to expand the OEM\u2019s obligations, the district court correctly concluded there was no triable claim for breach of the implied covenant."

      "reasoning":"All three issues arise from a grant of summary judgment and are reviewed de novo. On equitable indemnification, Massachusetts precedent strictly confines indemnity to situations of derivative or vicarious liability grounded in defined legal relationships. The tripartite reseller arrangement here\u2014with Zoll and Barracuda linked only via Fusion and with the relationships expressly characterized as independent contractors\u2014does not fit those categories, and the appellate court is unlikely to broaden indemnity doctrine to cover this scenario. On the OEM contract claim, nonfulfillment of the condition precedent is undisputed, and Axis\u2019s theories of waiver and estoppel rest solely on Barracuda\u2019s nonuse of a discretionary audit right, in the face of an express anti\u2011waiver clause and no duty to audit or advise Fusion about its own contracts. That is insufficient as a matter of Massachusetts law to create a genuine factual dispute. Finally, on the implied covenant claim, Axis fails to anchor its allegations of bad faith to any specific benefit conferred by the OEM, instead attempting to imply breach\u2011response obligations that the parties did not write into their agreement. Massachusetts law does not allow the covenant to create such new duties. Given the clarity of the contractual language and the narrowness of the relevant Massachusetts doctrines, the most likely appellate disposition is to affirm summary judgment on all issues."

      "factual_background":"Gina Del Rosario loaned Richard Joseph Legenza $58,000 to develop and commercialize a casino-based blackjack game that he created, called \"Wild Aces.\" The parties entered into a written \"Loan and Royalty Agreement\" under which the debt was acknowledged to be $70,000, accounting for interest. Under this Agreement, Legenza assigned to Del Rosario a percentage of royalties he would receive from licensing the Wild Aces game. The Agreement required that Wild Aces be placed in at least 30 casinos within 30 months. Legenza did not succeed in placing the game in the required number of casinos within that time frame. Del Rosario then asserted her contractual right to cancel the Agreement and demanded the return of her funds. Legenza did not return the funds. Del Rosario brought suit against him in Nevada state court. Shortly after that Nevada case was initiated, Legenza relocated from Las Vegas to Buffalo, New York, and commenced bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of New York. In connection with his handling of the loan funds, Legenza chose to keep the proceeds of Del Rosario\u2019s loan in cash, even though he maintained bank accounts for other purposes. As a result, there were no bank statements tracking the use of those loan funds. He relied on a cash journal and other paper records to track the proceeds. When he moved from Las Vegas to New York, he entrusted these records, including the cash journal, to a moving company, and those records were lost in the move. Because of this loss, there were no written records from which Del Rosario or the bankruptcy court could trace how the loan proceeds were used. Legenza has asserted that he can recall and mentally reconstruct the expenses and transactions related to the development and marketing of Wild Aces, and that the expenses are reasonably reproducible from his recollection, but he does not possess contemporaneous written records documenting those transactions.",

That easily satisfies the creditor\u2019s prima facie burden of showing an absence of adequate records from which the business transactions and financial condition can be ascertained. Under prevailing \u00a7 727(a)(3) precedent, keeping a large investment in untraceable cash and relying solely on a single set of unsecured paper records is objectively inadequate. The bankruptcy court had \u2018reasonably wide discretion\u2019 to decide whether the records met statutory requirements and whether the failure was justified; on these facts, concluding that the record-keeping was insufficient and unjustified is well within that discretion. On de novo review of the summary judgment, there is no competing evidence that could permit a reasonable factfinder to find that adequate records existed.

          "reasoning":"Once the absence of adequate records was established, the burden shifted to the debtor to justify that failure. His proffered justification rests on (1) operating a small business, (2) keeping large sums in cash while having bank accounts, (3) relying on a single cash journal and paper records, and (4) losing those records in a routine interstate move. Courts routinely hold that small-business status does not excuse the failure to maintain basic, reliable records, especially for a substantial investment of this size, and that unsecured paper-only records are inadequate where easily available safer methods (bank accounts, electronic or duplicate records) could have been used. Entrusting papers to a mover, with no backups, is a foreseeable risk and not a compelling justification. As to In re Brenes, that decision is nonbinding and, even if considered, does not compel a different outcome on materially worse facts. The bankruptcy court applied the correct statutory \u2018all the circumstances\u2019 standard, and it was within its discretion to find that these circumstances did not justify the record-keeping failure.

The \u2018all the circumstances\u2019 inquiry is fact-intensive in principle, but it does not preclude summary judgment where the historical facts are settled and the dispute is purely over the legal sufficiency of the debtor\u2019s explanation. The debtor\u2019s own description of his conduct and justification was taken as true; the courts simply ruled that, even crediting his story, no reasonable factfinder could find an adequate justification or compliance with \u00a7 727(a)(3).

      "reasoning":"The denial of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(3) is strongly supported by the uncontested facts: a sizable investment was kept entirely in cash, minimal informal records were maintained, and those records were then lost without backup. The statute, as interpreted by the case law cited in the summary, requires recorded information sufficient to provide a true and accurate picture of the debtor\u2019s financial affairs, and emphasizes that creditors need not rely on the debtor\u2019s testimony or reconstructed memory. Once Del Rosario showed the absence of records, the burden shifted to Legenza to justify his failure. His status as a small businessman, his decision to keep large sums in cash, the lack of redundant or more formal record-keeping, and the loss of his sole set of papers in a move do not amount to a legally adequate justification under the prevailing approach. The argument that the creditor already knew enough about his finances misreads \u00a7 727(a)(3), which focuses on the existence of adequate records, not the creditor\u2019s subjective knowledge. His reliance on In re Brenes cannot overcome the discretion afforded to the bankruptcy court, and that decision is not controlling in any event. Because the key facts are undisputed and the only questions are the legal sufficiency of the records and justification, summary judgment was an appropriate procedural vehicle. On this record, an appellate court is highly likely to affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in full."

The complaint here expressly sought actual and other damages \"in an amount to be proven at trial,\" which is standard language and gave fair notice that monetary relief of that kind was sought. Under Ninth Circuit precedent such as Henry v. Sneiders, a general request for damages to be proved at trial is adequate to support a damages award upon default; the rule prevents an award of a different type of relief, or more than a specifically pleaded cap, not any award where no number was specified. The district court effectively treated the absence of a numerical amount as a demand for $0 and concluded that any monetary award would exceed that amount, which misreads Rule 54(c) and is inconsistent with Henry. Because the requested damages are the same kind as those demanded in the complaint, Rule 54(c) does not bar an actual-damages award here.

That reasoning is entirely derivative of the incorrect Rule 54(c) interpretation addressed in Issue 1. Once it is recognized that Rule 54(c) did not bar an award of actual damages, the premise for denying fees collapses. At a minimum, the court must reconsider the fee request in light of whatever damages are awarded on remand and any independent statutory standards (e.g., under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a)). The fee denial therefore cannot stand and must be vacated and remanded for reconsideration; whether any particular amount of fees is appropriate will then be reviewed, if necessary, under the applicable abuse-of-discretion standard at a later stage."

There is no indication in Ninth Circuit law that a failure to specify a precise dollar figure categorically bars any monetary relief in a default judgment; rather, Rule 54(c) is aimed at preventing awards of different kinds of relief or awards beyond a pleaded cap. The district court\u2019s interpretation effectively created a numerical-pleading requirement inconsistent with that framework. Because the denial of attorney\u2019s fees is expressly tied to the zero-damages outcome produced by this misinterpretation, it too rests on legal error.

      "factual_background":"Robert E. Shapiro is a neurologist who advocates for Americans with disabling headache disorders. In October 2018, he submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Social Security Administration (SSA) seeking records about how the SSA decides whether and how migraine and other headache-related disorders are included in the SSA's Listing of Impairments, and how SSA adjudicators evaluate disability claims involving such disorders. He requested all documents, regardless of age, relating to SSA assessment, evaluation, and decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion of a proposed listing for impairments due to migraine and other headache disorders in the Listing of Impairments, particularly in connection with SSA rulemaking between 2013 and 2016 for neurological listings. The request encompassed correspondence, emails, memoranda, drafts, cost-benefit analyses, public comments, guidance documents, and communications within SSA and between SSA and other federal agencies. He also sought documents regarding guidance to SSA adjudicators and administrative law judges on using existing listings, such as the epilepsy listing, to determine medical equivalence for migraine and other headache disorders. Shapiro stated that he sought these records to further scholarship on migraine disability and to increase public understanding of SSA's evaluation of migraine and headache-related disability claims. More than six months after the request, in May 2019, SSA responded, characterizing the request as \"unusual\" and \"non-program related\" and requiring payment of $2,908 in processing costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(c), which authorizes SSA to charge the full cost of responding to requests not directly related to administration of SSA programs. SSA advised he could narrow the request or cap his payment. Shapiro paid the full fee promptly. In July 2019, SSA issued a decision on the request, producing two memoranda and withholding 1,377 pages of responsive documents under FOIA Exemption 5 (inter-agency or intra-agency privileged materials); portions of the produced memoranda were redacted under Exemption 6 (personal privacy). In August 2019, Shapiro administratively appealed, challenging both the withholdings and the fee. He argued SSA improperly withheld the 1,377 pages and any additional responsive documents, and that the $2,908 fee should be discharged and refunded because SSA had not complied with FOIA\u2019s statutory time limits for responding to his request and appeal. Before SSA acted on the administrative appeal, Shapiro treated the appeal as constructively denied based on FOIA\u2019s deadlines and proceeded to litigation.",

He sought production of records, a refund of the $2,908 fee, and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.",
        "district_court_decision":"In July 2020, SSA moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, alternatively, for summary judgment. SSA argued that: (1) Shapiro had not exhausted administrative remedies because the request did not reasonably describe the records and thus was not a \"perfected\" FOIA request; (2) the agency was not required to respond because the request was unreasonably broad; and (3) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(c), the Cost-Reimbursement Provision, SSA had clear authority to assess the full cost of processing his non-program-related request notwithstanding FOIA\u2019s fee provisions. Shapiro cross-moved for summary judgment, arguing, as to fees, that his request was directly related to administration of SSA programs and therefore outside \u00a7 1306(c), and, alternatively, that FOIA\u2019s 2007 amendment prohibiting fees after untimely responses superseded or controlled over \u00a7 1306(c) as the later-enacted statute. In a March 8, 2021 order, the district court held that Shapiro had exhausted administrative remedies because SSA did not timely respond to his request and appeal. The court further held that SSA was not required to respond to the FOIA request on the merits because the request was unreasonably broad and burdensome, but nonetheless concluded that Shapiro was entitled to a refund of the $2,908 fee. The court reasoned that under the 2007 FOIA Amendment, SSA relinquished its right to assess fees by failing to comply with FOIA\u2019s response deadlines, and it ruled that FOIA\u2019s fee-preclusion provision prevailed over \u00a7 1306(c). The court ordered SSA to refund the fee and required SSA to specify a basis for its withholdings under Exemptions 5 and 6. The court deferred decision on attorneys\u2019 fees pending further submissions. In a subsequent order on December 10, 2021, after review of SSA\u2019s supplemental information, the district court concluded SSA properly withheld the disputed documents\u20141,845 pages in total\u2014under FOIA Exemption 5, and therefore did not need to address Exemption 6. Despite this, the court determined that Shapiro had partially prevailed by securing the refund order and the order requiring SSA to explain its withholdings. On that basis, the court awarded him partial attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On March 30, 2022, judgment was entered awarding Shapiro $10,262.75 in attorneys\u2019 fees, $444.50 in costs, and $2,908 in refunded FOIA fees.",

SSA contends this language unambiguously gives the agency authority to assess such fees even when FOIA\u2019s fee provisions, including the 2007 amendment barring fees after untimely responses, would otherwise preclude them.",
          "SSA contends that Shapiro\u2019s FOIA request was properly deemed \"non-program related\" under \u00a7 1306(c) and its implementing regulations because it was not needed to pursue a specific benefit under the Act, to verify information in connection with a particular SSA program, or to carry out a defined, authorized activity under the Act. Instead, SSA characterizes the request as broad and aimed at scholarly and public education purposes, which SSA views as outside the narrow program-related category.",

          "SSA also argues that the district court\u2019s use of implied-repeal reasoning was improper because \u00a7 1306(c)\u2019s notwithstanding clause shows Congress\u2019s intent that it operate even in the face of potentially conflicting FOIA provisions, and that the 2007 FOIA amendment should not be read to silently override this specific SSA provision."

The latter includes a strong \u2018notwithstanding FOIA or any other law\u2019 clause, is targeted to SSA\u2019s operations, and predates FOIA\u2019s amendment; standard interpretive principles disfavor reading a later general statute as implicitly displacing such a specific scheme. The two provisions can readily coexist: FOIA controls general FOIA fees; \u00a7 1306(c) carves out a distinct full\u2011cost recovery authority for non\u2011program\u2011related SSA requests. That makes the district court\u2019s reliance on implied\u2011repeal\u2011type reasoning untenable.

Once the district court\u2019s fee\u2011supersession holding is reversed and Shapiro\u2019s request is properly treated as non\u2011program related, SSA\u2019s retention of the $2,908 was lawful. With that fee\u2011refund order vacated and no disclosure ordered, Shapiro has not obtained the kind of enduring, merits\u2011based relief necessary to be deemed a substantially prevailing party eligible for attorneys\u2019 fees. Accordingly, the appellate court will reverse the refund and the fee award, leaving intact the district court\u2019s unchallenged merits ruling upholding SSA\u2019s Exemption 5 withholdings and its conclusion that SSA need not process the overbroad request further."

      "factual_background":"Mary E. Buscone and Ann Tracy Botelho were partners in a frozen yogurt business from May 2012 until January 2014. The business later failed. Botelho then sued Buscone in Massachusetts state court, alleging various causes of action related to their business relationship. Buscone did not respond to the state-court suit, and Botelho obtained a default judgment against her in the amount of $91,673.45, \"plus all interest and costs due thereunder,\" as provided under Massachusetts law.\n\nShortly after the state-court judgment, Buscone filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. In that Chapter 7 case, Botelho commenced an adversary proceeding seeking a determination that the state-court judgment debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(4). During that adversary proceeding, the bankruptcy court found that Buscone and her counsel, David G. Baker, engaged in significant discovery misconduct, including failure to comply with discovery orders, repeated failures to respond to discovery requests, and conduct the court characterized as attempts to obfuscate issues and continued noncompliance even after lesser sanctions such as fee-shifting were imposed. As a sanction for this discovery abuse, the bankruptcy court entered a default judgment in favor of Botelho in the adversary proceeding, determining that the state-court judgment debt was excepted from discharge in the Chapter 7 case.\n\nAfter completion of the Chapter 7 case, Buscone subsequently filed a new bankruptcy case under Chapter 13. In the Chapter 13 case, Botelho filed a proof of claim based on the Massachusetts state-court judgment debt that had been excepted from discharge in the Chapter 7 proceeding. Botelho calculated her claim at $145,140.42, consisting of the original state-court judgment principal amount of $91,673.45 plus $53,466.97 in accumulated post-judgment interest. Buscone objected to Botelho\u2019s proof of claim, challenging both Botelho\u2019s entitlement to assert the claim on grounds previously raised in the Chapter 7 adversary proceeding, and the manner in which Botelho calculated post-judgment interest (rate and accrual date).",

After discovery-related sanctions, the bankruptcy court entered a default judgment in that adversary proceeding, determining that the state-court judgment debt was not discharged. In the later Chapter 13 case, Botelho filed a proof of claim on the same judgment debt, including post-judgment interest under Massachusetts law. Buscone filed an objection to that proof of claim, raising: (1) a judicial-estoppel-based affirmative defense previously asserted in the Chapter 7 adversary proceeding; and (2) an argument that Botelho miscalculated post-judgment interest, asserting that interest should accrue only from the date of the bankruptcy court\u2019s default judgment in the Chapter 7 adversary proceeding and at the federal rate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 rather than at the Massachusetts state statutory rate from the date of the state-court judgment.",

Buscone appealed to the district court. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order overruling Buscone\u2019s objection, agreeing both that issue preclusion applied to prevent relitigation of the judicial-estoppel defense and that Massachusetts law governed the rate and accrual date of post-judgment interest on the state-court judgment debt.

She argues that this exception applies here, because Buscone and her counsel engaged in repeated and egregious discovery abuses, failed to comply with court orders, and nevertheless actively participated enough in the adversary proceeding (including filing a motion to dismiss asserting the judicial-estoppel defense and providing discovery responses, albeit deficient) to satisfy the opportunity-to-litigate requirement.",

Under Grella and analogous authority, this satisfies the 'actually litigated' and 'full and fair opportunity' requirements for issue preclusion when the default is a punitive sanction for litigation misconduct.

The subsequent Chapter 7 adversary judgment was not a new federal money judgment for damages; it was a nondischargeability determination that gave effect to the existing state\u2011court judgment. Under both general principles and cited precedent, a federal nondischargeability judgment that merely declares a state\u2011court judgment nondischargeable does not extinguish or replace the underlying state judgment and does not reset the interest clock or change the applicable rate. Section 1961 governs interest on federal civil money judgments; it does not override state\u2011law post\u2011judgment interest on an independently existing state judgment simply because a bankruptcy court later declares that judgment nondischargeable.

On interest, the structure of bankruptcy law and the cited Massachusetts statutes strongly favor treating the state\u2011court judgment as the operative source of the debt, with interest governed by state law from the original judgment date, and the nondischargeability judgment as merely declaratory of discharge status rather than a new federal damages judgment. Given that both the bankruptcy court and the district court reached the same conclusions on both points, and that those conclusions are well supported by precedent, the most plausible First Circuit disposition is to affirm across the board."

      "factual_background":"Maine adopted a COVID-19 vaccination requirement for designated healthcare facilities by emergency rule effective August 12, 2021, codified in 10-144-264 Me. Code R. \u00a7 2. The rule required covered healthcare facilities to ensure that all employees who did not work exclusively remotely provided proof of immunization or immunity against COVID-19, among other specified infectious diseases. The underlying authorizing statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, \u00a7 802(4-B), empowers the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) to adopt immunization rules for certain healthcare settings and identifies the types of exemptions that may be allowed, but does not specify particular diseases or mention COVID-19 itself.\n\nThe plaintiffs are healthcare workers in Maine who worked at covered healthcare facilities and did not work exclusively remotely. They declined to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, asserting religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccines. Because the mandate and accompanying regulatory scheme did not provide for religious exemptions (while allowing other specified exemptions), plaintiffs refused vaccination and were ultimately terminated from their employment at the covered healthcare facilities.\n\nThe emergency rule was enforced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. MDHHS and the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (MCDC) monitored the COVID-19 situation, including the emergence of variants (such as Delta and later Omicron), vaccination rates among healthcare workers and the general public, hospitalization and death rates, and the development of vaccines, booster doses, antigen tests, and antiviral treatments. Over time, data indicated increased population immunity (through vaccination and prior infections), reduced disease severity with newer variants, declining hospitalization and death rates, and improved treatments.\n\nAt the federal level, the Biden administration announced in January 2023 that the federal COVID-19 public health emergency would be extended to May 11, 2023, and then end on that date. The federal public health emergency ended on May 11, 2023. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on May 1, 2023, that it would end the federal staff vaccination requirement for covered healthcare providers, and CMS formally withdrew its healthcare staff COVID-19 vaccination requirement on June 5, 2023. The Maine public health emergency, tied in duration to the federal one, also ended on May 11, 2023.\n\nIn July 2023, MDHHS publicly announced that it was proposing to eliminate the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for healthcare workers and that it would not enforce that requirement during the rulemaking process to repeal it. MDHHS explained that, although vaccination remained an important public health tool, the mandate had achieved its intended benefits of saving lives, protecting healthcare capacity, and limiting virus spread during the height of the pandemic, and that changed circumstances \u2013 including high vaccination and booster uptake (especially among older adults), improved treatments, increased population immunity, and declining infection, hospitalization, and death rates \u2013 supported reconsideration of the requirement. MDHHS also cited CMS\u2019s withdrawal of its federal staff vaccine requirement and noted that Maine was then one of a small number of states still maintaining some type of COVID-19 vaccine requirement.\n\nPursuant to Maine\u2019s rulemaking procedures, MDHHS conducted public notice-and-comment rulemaking to remove COVID-19 from the list of diseases for which vaccination of healthcare workers is required and to make related conforming changes. The Rulemaking Fact Sheet again grounded the proposal in updated clinical and epidemiological data, increased population immunity, decreasing disease severity, improved treatments, declining infection and death rates, and CMS\u2019s withdrawal of its federal requirement following the end of the federal public health emergency. The amended regulation, which removed COVID-19 from the list of required immunizations for covered healthcare workers, became effective September 5, 2023.\n\nIn litigation, the state submitted a declaration from the Deputy Director of MCDC describing MDHHS\u2019s ongoing monitoring of COVID-19 since late 2021 and its planning for the end of the public health emergency beginning in early 2023. The declaration explained that, around late May and early June 2023, MDHHS and MCDC reviewed available scientific data and research regarding COVID-19 risks in healthcare settings, including information on variants, vaccination and booster rates, disease prevalence, hospitalization and death data, availability of antigen tests, antiviral treatments (such as Paxlovid and Lagrevio), and new vaccine formulations (including bivalent boosters and the Novavax vaccine for individuals unable or unwilling to take mRNA vaccines). Based on these developments, MDHHS concluded that continued inclusion of COVID-19 in the healthcare worker vaccination rule was no longer necessary. The declaration stated that MDHHS had no plans to re-include COVID-19 among the diseases for which vaccination of healthcare workers is required and that, in light of the scientific and epidemiological data and prevailing trends, it was highly unlikely that MDHHS would seek to impose a similar COVID-19 vaccination requirement on designated healthcare facilities in the future. The declaration attached graphs showing declining COVID-19 hospitalization and death rates in Maine from late 2021 through 2023.\n\nThe plaintiffs did not submit competing evidence on the mootness-related factual issues and did not depose state officials. They did not contest the accuracy of the state\u2019s data but argued that the data did not support the state\u2019s mootness position and asserted that the timing of the repeal suggested a litigation-driven motive.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In 2021, plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine against their former employers (including MaineHealth, Genesis Healthcare entities, MaineGeneral Health, and Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center) and various Maine government officials, including the Governor, the Acting Commissioner of MDHHS, and MCDC leadership. They alleged that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for covered healthcare workers, insofar as it lacked religious exemptions while permitting other exemptions, violated the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, among other claims. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief preventing enforcement of what they termed the Governor\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, as well as other relief.",
        "district_court_decision":"Upon filing the complaint in 2021, plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the mandate. The district court denied that request for preliminary injunctive relief. Plaintiffs appealed the denial; the First Circuit affirmed denial of the preliminary injunction, and the Supreme Court subsequently denied plaintiffs\u2019 applications for emergency injunctive relief pending appeal.\n\nOn February 14, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On August 18, 2022, the district court granted the motion to dismiss all claims. Plaintiffs appealed. In May 2023, the First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, reinstating the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment Free Exercise and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Commissioner of MDHHS and the Director of MCDC in their official capacities, and remanding for further proceedings on those claims.\n\nAfter MDHHS completed rulemaking and the amended regulation removing COVID-19 from the list of required immunizations for healthcare workers became effective on September 5, 2023, the remaining state-official defendants moved to dismiss the reinstated declaratory and injunctive-relief claims as moot. In connection with that motion, they submitted the MDHHS\/MCDC declaration and supporting data. Plaintiffs opposed dismissal but submitted no evidence, did not seek discovery on mootness, and argued, among other things, that their challenge included a facial attack on the authorizing statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, \u00a7 802.\n\nThe district court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 challenge was not a facial challenge to the statute but an as-applied challenge to the pre-repeal operation of the COVID-19 vaccination requirement in conjunction with the statute. The court found that the statute itself merely authorized MDHHS to adopt immunization rules and exemptions and did not impose a COVID-19 vaccination requirement or identify diseases; the requirement at issue arose solely from the regulation, which had been repealed. The court also noted that plaintiffs had never challenged the regulation\u2019s requirements as to other vaccines (such as measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis B, and influenza), reinforcing that the case was limited to COVID-19.\n\nThe district court granted the motion to dismiss on mootness grounds, concluding that, because the COVID-19 vaccine mandate had been repealed and was no longer enforced, the court could no longer provide relief that would redress plaintiffs\u2019 ongoing injuries for purposes of declaratory or injunctive relief. It further held that neither the voluntary cessation exception nor the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception to mootness applied. The court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the repeal was a bad-faith litigation tactic and found that plaintiffs had not offered sworn evidence or requested discovery to support their theory.\n\nIn the same ruling, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request, made in their opposition to the motion to dismiss, for leave to amend the complaint. The court reasoned that justice did not require allowing plaintiffs to substantially broaden their claims at that stage to mount a facial challenge to the entire immunization rule and underlying statute, and that plaintiffs had not identified any post-filing transactions, occurrences, or events that would justify supplemental pleading under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d).",

They argue the district court mischaracterized the scope of the complaint by limiting it to the pre-repeal regulation and the specific COVID-19 vaccination requirement.",
          "They argue that their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are not moot because the repeal of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate was a litigation tactic aimed at avoiding an adverse ruling, and the underlying statutory and regulatory framework for imposing similar mandates remains in place. They maintain that there is still a live controversy over the constitutionality of that framework and its exemption structure, particularly with respect to religious accommodation.",
          "On voluntary cessation, plaintiffs assert that Maine\u2019s withdrawal of the COVID-19 vaccination requirement shortly after the First Circuit\u2019s 2023 decision reinstating their constitutional claims shows that the repeal was motivated by the litigation rather than by independent public health considerations. They point to the timing of the repeal and selective data about hospitalization and death rates around the repeal period to argue that public health conditions did not warrant rescission and that the state\u2019s reasons are pretextual. They emphasize that the state retains the authority to reimpose a similar COVID-19 vaccination requirement under the same statutory regime.",
          "On the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception, plaintiffs argue that COVID-19-related mandates are inherently of limited duration because they respond to evolving public health emergencies, such that challenges to them are likely to evade full judicial review before they are changed or rescinded. They maintain that they remain at risk of being subjected again to a substantially similar vaccination requirement that does not provide religious exemptions if COVID-19 conditions worsen or another outbreak occurs, particularly because they continue to work, or intend to work, in the healthcare sector in Maine.",
          "Regarding amendment, plaintiffs contend that justice requires allowing them to amend or supplement their complaint to clarify and broaden their constitutional challenge in light of developments during the litigation, including the First Circuit\u2019s remand and the state\u2019s regulatory changes. They argue there was no undue delay or bad faith, that defendants would not be unduly prejudiced, and that amendment is necessary to address the ongoing constitutional issues posed by the remaining immunization rule and authorizing statute, including their lack of religious exemptions."

Consequently, there is no ongoing conduct to enjoin and no present controversy regarding the validity of that mandate for the court to adjudicate.",
          "On voluntary cessation, the state officials contend that the repeal was not a litigation strategy but the product of a long-running, evidence-based public health process that tracked the end of the federal public health emergency, CMS\u2019s withdrawal of its federal staff vaccine requirement, and substantial changes in COVID-19 epidemiology, treatment, and vaccination rates. They rely on the MDHHS declaration and attached data to show that they reviewed evolving clinical and epidemiological evidence and, based on that review, concluded the mandate was no longer necessary. They further argue that it is highly unlikely that the same or a substantially similar COVID-19 vaccine mandate will be reimposed, citing the declaration\u2019s express statement that MDHHS has no plans to reinclude COVID-19 in the immunization rule and views it as highly unlikely that similar requirements will be adopted in the future.",
          "On the capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-review exception, the state officials argue that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate was not inherently too short-lived to be fully litigated, as it remained in effect for a considerable period and could have remained longer if conditions warranted. They point out that COVID-19 mandates, unlike elections or pregnancies, are not intrinsically transitory in duration, and that plaintiffs have not shown that no case raising similar issues could be adjudicated on the merits before any future change in policy. They also argue that plaintiffs have not provided non-speculative evidence that they personally are likely to be subjected to the same mandate again.",

They contend that plaintiffs did not identify any post-pleading transaction, occurrence, or event to justify supplementation under Rule 15(d), and that allowing such a drastic expansion of the case at that stage would be inconsistent with standards governing amendment and judicial efficiency."

The general statutory framework remains, but, given the district court\u2019s correct as\u2011applied characterization (issue 1), the live controversy was tied to the repealed rule.

Here, the state supported repeal with a detailed declaration and data showing a multi\u2011year, evidence\u2011based process keyed to the end of the federal public health emergency, CMS\u2019s rescission of its federal mandate, high vaccination\/booster rates, increased population immunity, decreased severity, and improved treatments. The agency expressly stated it had no plans to re\u2011include COVID\u201119 and viewed it as highly unlikely a similar mandate would be reimposed. Plaintiffs offered no competing evidence, did not pursue discovery, and relied mainly on timing and speculation about litigation motives.

It requires both that (1) the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully litigated and (2) the same plaintiffs are reasonably likely to face the same action again. The healthcare worker vaccine rule was in force for a substantial period (roughly two years), long enough for multiple rounds of litigation, including emergency relief, merits dismissal, and an interlocutory appeal; it is not inherently transitory like pregnancy or election cycles. The fact that the state later chose to repeal it based on changed conditions does not make it \u2018inherently\u2019 too short\u2011lived. As to recurrence, plaintiffs show only a generalized possibility that another COVID\u201119 spike (or future disease) could occasion another mandate; they lack non\u2011speculative evidence that these same individuals will again confront a substantially identical requirement without religious exemptions.

The district court reasonably found this an untimely attempt to \u2018substantially broaden\u2019 the case after years of litigation, after an earlier appeal, and without any new, post\u2011pleading transactions that would justify supplementation under Rule 15(d). Allowing such an expansion would be prejudicial and inefficient, effectively restarting the case on a new legal theory after the original dispute has become moot.

Plaintiffs\u2019 effort to reframe the case as a facial challenge to the broader statutory and regulatory framework is inconsistent with the pleadings and the litigation\u2019s prior framing, and the district court\u2019s as\u2011applied characterization is legally sound. The recognized mootness exceptions do not fit well here: the state provided detailed, unrebutted evidence that repeal resulted from changed public health conditions and federal policy shifts, and it disavowed plans to reenact a similar rule, which undercuts voluntary\u2011cessation concerns; the rule was not inherently short\u2011lived, and any risk that these same plaintiffs will be subject to an identical mandate is speculative, defeating the capable\u2011of\u2011repetition doctrine. Finally, the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend or supplement\u2014made late, informally, and seeking a drastic expansion of the case\u2014is well within its discretion under Rules 15(a) and 15(d).

      "factual_background":"Snohomish Regional Fire and Rescue (SRFR) is a fire protection and emergency medical services provider in Snohomish County, Washington. Its service area covers about 135 square miles and approximately 175,000 people, including around 2,500 inmates at the Monroe Correctional Complex, a state men\u2019s prison. In 2021, SRFR responded to roughly 18,000 emergency calls, about 85% of which were for emergency medical services. It operates eleven fire stations staffed by nearly two hundred career firefighters. Firefighters work 24\u2011hour shifts, and the stations function as their workplace, home, and gym during those shifts.\n\nOn August 9, 2021, Washington Governor Jay Inslee issued Proclamation 21\u201114, requiring all healthcare workers to be vaccinated against COVID\u201119 by October 2021. The Proclamation directed employers to comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), and it stated that healthcare workers were not required to be vaccinated if they were entitled to an accommodation for a sincerely held religious belief. The Proclamation also acknowledged that employers need not provide such accommodations if doing so would cause undue hardship.\n\nIn response, SRFR implemented a COVID\u201119 vaccination mandate for its firefighters but created a process for employees to request religious accommodations. SRFR provided information about the mandate and the accommodation process. Out of 192 firefighters, 46 requested exemptions based on religious beliefs, including the eight plaintiffs in this case. All plaintiffs served in various firefighting and emergency medical technician (EMT) or paramedic roles and were required to maintain current EMT or paramedic certification.\n\nSRFR\u2019s Human Resources staff met individually with each employee who requested an exemption to discuss their religious accommodation request and possible accommodations. At the same time, SRFR negotiated with the firefighters\u2019 union, the International Association of Fire Fighters, Local 2781, and entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that modified the collective bargaining agreement to specify options for employees whom SRFR determined could not be accommodated in their healthcare roles.\n\nUnder the MOU, unvaccinated firefighters who could not remain in frontline roles were allowed to use accrued paid leave while remaining employed. After exhausting paid leave, they could take a one\u2011year unpaid leave of absence. The MOU further provided that firefighters who chose to leave SRFR could be placed on a disability rehire list, giving them priority to return within two years without loss of rank, seniority, or benefit accrual status. It also stated that unvaccinated frontline employees could return to work during their period of absence if the Proclamation were updated or amended to permit such a return.\n\nIn October 2021, after reviewing the situation, SRFR determined that it could not maintain unvaccinated firefighters in frontline firefighting and EMS roles without undue hardship on its operations. SRFR concluded that because firefighters routinely interface closely with the public and co\u2011workers, it had no suitable alternative positions away from patient care, and it could not feasibly implement plaintiffs\u2019 proposed alternative accommodations\u2014masking, regular testing, and social distancing\u2014in a way that would adequately control COVID\u201119 risks. SRFR encouraged all 46 employees who had requested exemptions to first use accumulated leave and then apply for a one\u2011year unpaid leave of absence; SRFR approved all such leave requests.\n\nSRFR continued to monitor public health information regarding COVID\u201119, including the impact of variants such as Delta and Omicron, and evaluated the risks to its operations, employees, and the community through 2021 and into 2022. In May 2022, after the Omicron wave had subsided, SRFR informed unvaccinated employees that they could either remain on leave or return to their patient\u2011care roles, subject to applicable guidelines. Four of the plaintiffs returned to work shortly after that notice; others returned later.\n\nSRFR supported its assessment of COVID\u201119 risks with medical evidence, including a declaration from Dr. John Lynch, an infectious disease physician and professor who helped lead the University of Washington\u2019s COVID\u201119 response. Dr. Lynch opined that vaccination was the best tool to reduce spread and serious illness from COVID\u201119, that vaccination provided better protection than prior infection alone, and that individuals who chose infection over vaccination risked severe illness and transmission to others. He noted that, during the relevant time, cases were spiking due to the Delta variant and later the Omicron waves. He analyzed the fire station environment and concluded that non\u2011pharmaceutical interventions such as masking, testing, and social distancing would not be effective substitutes for vaccination in preventing spread in that setting.\n\nAccording to Dr. Lynch, regular testing was insufficient due to limitations in test accuracy and the possibility of transmission between tests; personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks, were complements rather than substitutes for vaccination, and masks only provided protection while worn and could not be worn continuously (e.g., during sleep, meals, or certain physical activities). Social distancing was also limited because firefighters often work in close quarters, including in vehicles, in residences, public buildings, and in close contact with patients, many of whom are part of higher\u2011risk populations. He concluded that vaccination, particularly in combination with other measures, was the single best tool to limit transmission.\n\nEvidence in the record included testimony that firefighters did not always wear masks or maintain distance in the stations; some plaintiffs acknowledged that masks were not worn while sleeping, eating, drinking, or at all times in the station. The fire chief also observed numerous instances of firefighters without masks. Plaintiffs submitted declarations asserting they could safely perform their jobs using precautions and that they did not transmit COVID\u201119 to others, but they offered no medical expert evidence supporting the sufficiency of their proposed accommodations.\n\nSRFR identified several types of costs and risks it associated with keeping unvaccinated firefighters in their roles: (1) health and safety risks to firefighters and to the public they serve, including high\u2011risk populations such as the Monroe Correctional Complex inmates and hospital patients; (2) operational burdens from the large number of exemption requests\u2014close to one quarter of the firefighting workforce\u2014 and the risk that outbreaks or extensive sick leave could severely limit SRFR\u2019s ability to provide emergency services; (3) financial risks from increased absenteeism and related staffing issues; (4) the potential loss of a contract with the Washington Department of Corrections (DOC), which generated almost $400,000 in annual revenue and which required proof of vaccination for on\u2011site contractor personnel, with DOC indicating it had not identified reasonable on\u2011site accommodations for unvaccinated contractors; and (5) potential uninsured liability exposure, because SRFR\u2019s insurance policy included a communicable disease exclusion and the insurer advised that it would not defend or indemnify SRFR if sued over an allegation that an unvaccinated employee transmitted COVID\u201119.\n\nPlaintiffs, for their part, contended that they could have been safely accommodated through masking, testing, social distancing, shift assignments, separate sleeping arrangements and restrooms for unvaccinated personnel, and other measures, and they pointed to periods before and after the October 2021 to May 2022 mandate window\u2014when SRFR operated without a vaccination requirement\u2014as evidence that alternatives were workable. They also noted that other fire departments in the region allowed unvaccinated firefighters to continue working and that at least one plaintiff was hired by a neighboring department while on leave from SRFR and worked alongside SRFR firefighters under a mutual\u2011aid agreement.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In November 2022, the eight firefighter plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against SRFR, Fire Chief Kevin O\u2019Brien, and unnamed defendants. They asserted two causes of action: (1) failure to accommodate their religious beliefs, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq.); and (2) violation of the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) based on an alleged failure to provide reasonable religious accommodations. Plaintiffs sought, among other relief, a declaration that, under the circumstances, a leave of absence does not constitute a lawful reasonable accommodation under Title VII or WLAD, as well as damages and other appropriate relief. The parties later stipulated to the dismissal of Chief O\u2019Brien as a defendant.",
        "district_court_decision":"SRFR moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs\u2019 Title VII and WLAD claims failed because accommodating their requests for exemption from the COVID\u201119 vaccination requirement would have imposed an undue hardship on SRFR\u2019s business. Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, contending that SRFR had failed to reasonably accommodate their religious objections to vaccination. The district court assumed, without scrutinizing the specifics of plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs, that plaintiffs had bona fide religious objections and that they had established a prima facie case of religious discrimination under Title VII. The court then analyzed whether SRFR could have reasonably accommodated plaintiffs\u2019 religious objections without undue hardship. It found, based on the undisputed evidence including expert medical testimony, that allowing unvaccinated firefighters to work in patient\u2011care roles would significantly increase the risk of COVID\u201119 transmission even with masks and PPE, because such measures are effective only when used and could not always be used by firefighters. The court determined that unvaccinated firefighters were at higher risk of contracting and transmitting COVID\u201119 despite masking, PPE, testing, and social distancing, and that the fact that 46 out of 192 firefighters requested religious exemptions increased the hardship and risks associated with maintaining them in frontline roles while living and working in shared fire stations. The court evaluated the WLAD claim under the same, more demanding federal undue hardship standard. Concluding that the record showed undue hardship in accommodating the requested vaccine exemptions, the district court granted summary judgment for SRFR and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion. It entered final judgment in favor of SRFR.",

          "legal_standard":"Under Title VII, to establish a failure\u2011to\u2011accommodate religious discrimination claim, a plaintiff must first make a prima facie showing that: (1) he has a bona fide religious belief, the practice of which conflicts with an employment duty; (2) he informed his employer of the belief and conflict; and (3) he was discharged, threatened, or otherwise subjected to an adverse employment action because of his inability to comply with the conflicting job requirement. Once the plaintiff makes this showing, the burden shifts to the employer to prove either that it initiated good\u2011faith efforts to reasonably accommodate the employee\u2019s religious practice or that it could not reasonably accommodate that practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer\u2019s business. Under Groff v. DeJoy, \u2018undue hardship\u2019 under Title VII is established when, considering all relevant factors\u2014including the nature, size, and operating costs of the employer\u2019s business and the specific accommodation at issue\u2014granting the accommodation would result in a burden that is substantial in the overall context of the employer\u2019s business, involving substantial increased costs or a burden rising to an excessive or unjustifiable level. WLAD\u2019s religious accommodation standard is interpreted in harmony with federal law and, at the time relevant here, Washington courts looked to federal Title VII precedent and have since adopted the substantial cost test."

          "reasoning":"The appeal challenges a grant of summary judgment on Title VII and WLAD religious-accommodation claims, so the Ninth Circuit reviews de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the firefighters. Even under Groff\u2019s heightened standard, SRFR presented substantial, largely undisputed evidence that keeping a sizable number of unvaccinated firefighters (46 of 192) in close-quarters, patient-facing roles during the Delta\/Omicron period would impose a substantial burden in the overall context of its business.\n\nSRFR relied on detailed, unrebutted medical expert testimony from Dr. Lynch that vaccination was significantly more effective than masking\/testing\/distancing in this particular environment, and that those measures were not viable substitutes because they could not be used continuously and tests had accuracy and timing gaps. The record also showed actual practice: firefighters did not and could not mask or distance consistently in stations, on calls, or while sleeping and eating. Plaintiffs offered only lay declarations and anecdotal assertions, not countervailing expert evidence, to dispute the medical risks or comparative effectiveness of their preferred measures.\n\nBeyond health and safety, SRFR documented operational and financial impacts well within Groff\u2019s concept of \u2018substantial in the overall context\u2019: (1) risk of serious spread within a critical emergency-services workforce if nearly a quarter remained unvaccinated; (2) risk of impaired response capacity from outbreaks and related absenteeism; (3) concrete contractual risk with the DOC, which affirmatively required vaccination of on\u2011site contractor personnel and could not identify workable alternatives; and (4) realistic uninsured liability exposure given the communicable-disease exclusion and the insurer\u2019s express warning. These were not wholly speculative; they were tied to existing contracts, insurance terms, and the then\u2011current public\u2011health environment.\n\nThe firefighters\u2019 showing that SRFR previously and later operated without a mandate, and that some neighboring agencies used different approaches, raises at most policy disagreements, not a triable question on whether SRFR\u2019s own assessment of its risks and burdens was unreasonable or pretextual. Groff does not require an employer to adopt the least restrictive regime in the market or to wait for an actual outbreak or lawsuit before relying on substantial, evidence\u2011based risk assessments.\n\nOn the accommodation side, SRFR made individualized inquiries, bargained for a tailored MOU, and provided a structured regime of paid leave, unpaid leave, rehire protections, and a pathway back when conditions changed. Title VII does not guarantee an employee\u2019s preferred accommodation, and leave can be a reasonable accommodation, particularly where the only alternative proposed by the employees (remaining unvaccinated in frontline roles) has been shown to create undue hardship. The record does not show specific, feasible, frontline assignments or station arrangements that would both maintain emergency coverage and materially mitigate the risks identified by SRFR\u2019s unrefuted expert evidence.\n\nGiven this evidentiary posture, no genuine dispute of material fact appears on the dispositive questions: (a) whether keeping unvaccinated firefighters in frontline EMS\/fire roles during the relevant period would create substantial health, operational, and financial burdens in the overall context of SRFR\u2019s business, and (b) whether SRFR offered at least one reasonable accommodation. The district court did not weigh credibility or resolve conflicting expert evidence; rather, plaintiffs simply failed to produce competent evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to reject SRFR\u2019s undue\u2011hardship showing under Groff. Accordingly, de novo review should result in affirmance on both the Title VII and WLAD claims."

      "overall_outcome":"AFFIRM",

      "reasoning":"The dispositive issue is whether SRFR met its burden, under the post\u2011Groff \u2018substantial burden in the overall context of the business\u2019 standard, to show undue hardship from accommodating plaintiffs\u2019 request to remain unvaccinated frontline firefighters, and whether the leave\u2011based scheme was a lawful reasonable accommodation. The record contains robust, specific evidence from SRFR\u2014especially unrebutted medical expert testimony about disease transmission in this particular work setting, coupled with concrete operational, contractual, and insurance-related burdens\u2014that comfortably satisfies Groff\u2019s more demanding test. Plaintiffs\u2019 contrary showing consists largely of anecdotal experience, comparisons to other agencies, and argument that SRFR\u2019s concerns were speculative, without medical or economic expert support. That evidentiary gap makes it unlikely a reasonable jury could find that accommodating their requested exemption in frontline roles would not impose substantial burdens.\n\nFurther, SRFR\u2019s negotiated MOU and individualized meetings demonstrate good\u2011faith efforts, and Title VII\/WLAD do not require employers to maintain employees in their preferred roles when those roles themselves create undue hardship; leave can constitute a reasonable accommodation in such circumstances. Because these conclusions are grounded in undisputed or one\u2011sided evidence rather than credibility determinations, the de novo summary\u2011judgment review strongly favors affirmance on all claims, leading to an overall affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment."

      "factual_background":"The plaintiffs are music companies and music publishers that own or control copyrights in a catalog of sound recordings and musical compositions, all affiliated with or formerly affiliated with EMI. The defendants (collectively, Vimeo) operate vimeo.com, an online video\u2011sharing platform founded in 2004. Vimeo is a popular website that allows registered users to upload videos. By 2007, Vimeo had about 40,000 registered users; by 2012, approximately 12.3 million users were posting roughly 43,000 new videos per day.\n\nOn Vimeo, registered users can upload videos, add tags and descriptions, and make their videos either private or publicly viewable. Private videos can be viewed only by specifically authorized accounts or those with a password; non\u2011private videos can be streamed by anyone with internet access and, unless disabled by the uploader, can be downloaded. Other users can comment on, \u201clike,\u201d subscribe to groups, and create or follow channels organized around themes.\n\nVimeo offers free and paid subscription tiers. Most revenue comes from subscription fees. Vimeo also sells advertising on the site; some ads are directly contracted with advertisers and are paid per view, while others are served through Google AdSense and generate revenue per click. Beginning in 2011, Vimeo, through contracts with certain rightsholders (primarily smaller labels not including any plaintiff here), operated a virtual music store from which users could purchase licenses for particular non\u2011major\u2011label music, with Vimeo earning commissions on those sales.\n\nVimeo imposes content and upload rules. It represents itself as a platform for user\u2011created content and forbids users from uploading videos that were not created at least in part by the uploader. Vimeo\u2019s Terms of Service require users not to upload infringing content and not to post content inconsistent with specified restrictions. Certain categories of videos are disallowed, including advertising spots (commercials, infomercials, product promotions), real estate walkthroughs, abusive or sexually explicit content, and, beginning in 2008, most \u201cgameplay\u201d videos. Vimeo also bars uploads of movies, TV shows, and trailers. To register, users must agree to those Terms of Service, and each upload is accompanied by reminders of the self\u2011created\u2011content requirement and other restrictions.\n\nVimeo does not pre\u2011screen all videos, but it engages in some curation and moderation. Members of Vimeo\u2019s \"Community Team\" sometimes post likes and comments, upload their own videos, join or create groups and channels, and promote user videos by placing them in prominent locations such as the Vimeo blog or the \"Staff Picks\" channel. Staff may also remove videos, and in some cases user accounts, for violations of the Terms.\n\nVimeo also deploys automated tools (\"Mod Tools\") to help identify potentially problematic content. These tools can, for example, flag videos with unusually high view counts, search for current film titles, locate videos roughly the length of a typical 30\u2011 or 60\u2011minute television show, and identify users uploading unusually large numbers of videos in a short time. Content flagged by such tools is manually reviewed by staff. Additionally, users can \"flag\" videos they believe violate the Terms of Service; community moderators then review the flagged material and decide whether to remove it.\n\nVimeo has at times encouraged certain types of user\u2011generated content. In 2006, Vimeo\u2019s founder created and posted a video of himself lip\u2011synching to a song while walking, then synced that video with recorded music and labeled the practice \"lip\u2011dubbing.\" He invited users to create similar lip\u2011dub videos. At a company party, Vimeo employees made a lip\u2011dub video that became popular. Lip\u2011dubbing then became a trend; Vimeo created a \"Lip Dub Stars\" channel. A lip balm company paid Vimeo to advertise on that channel and sponsored a lip\u2011dub contest.\n\nRegarding employees\u2019 awareness of copyright practices, some Vimeo employees themselves created and posted videos, including videos that used music owned by plaintiffs, without securing licenses. Around 2009, Vimeo\u2019s legal staff instructed employees not to include copyrighted music in the background of videos they created. Vimeo used a scripted response for user inquiries about using copyrighted music, stating that adding third\u2011party copyrighted content to a video \"generally (but not always) constitutes copyright infringement.\" Plaintiffs introduced evidence that in a few instances employees supplemented the scripted response with informal encouragements such as \"off the record . . . Go ahead and post it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have anything to worry about.\" Vimeo characterizes those responses as isolated, unauthorized, and contrary to company policy. In connection with the 2011 launch of its virtual music store, Vimeo published a blog post acknowledging that music licensing can be \"confusing\" and \"painful.\"\n\nThe dispute here centers on user\u2011uploaded videos that incorporate recordings of musical performances whose rights are owned or controlled by plaintiffs (referred to as the \"Videos\u2011in\u2011Suit\"). For purposes of summary judgment, Vimeo conceded that the videos in question contained plaintiffs\u2019 music and that the uses were infringing. It is undisputed that plaintiffs never licensed Vimeo or Vimeo\u2019s users to use this music and that Vimeo never paid plaintiffs for such use. In 2008, EMI sent Vimeo a cease\u2011and\u2011desist letter demanding removal of 173 specified videos using EMI recordings and compositions and requesting that Vimeo \"immediately take appropriate action to ensure that all other EMI\u2011owned or \u2011controlled works are removed from the Site.\" Vimeo removed the 173 specified videos. Internal emails among Vimeo employees afterward contained disparaging references to EMI personnel. After the initial letter, EMI sent additional DMCA takedown notices, with which Vimeo complied.\n\nThe videos that remain at issue on appeal are 281 user\u2011uploaded videos, uploaded between 2006 and 2013, that include recordings owned or controlled by plaintiffs and with which Vimeo employees interacted in some way (for example, by commenting on them, liking them, promoting or demoting them, or placing them in a community channel). These do not include videos uploaded by Vimeo employees themselves.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On December 10, 2009, plaintiffs filed an initial complaint in the Southern District of New York against Vimeo and related entities asserting copyright infringement based on 199 specified videos that allegedly used music owned or controlled by plaintiffs without authorization. Plaintiffs sought to hold Vimeo liable for direct and\/or secondary copyright infringement arising from user\u2011uploaded videos containing plaintiffs\u2019 sound recordings and compositions. In May 2012, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add more than 1,000 additional allegedly infringing videos.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court (Judge Ronnie Abrams) denied without prejudice the 2012 motion to amend, granting leave to renew after resolution of summary judgment. On September 7, 2012, Vimeo moved for summary judgment, asserting protection under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) safe harbor in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c). On November 16, 2012, plaintiffs cross\u2011moved for partial summary judgment that Vimeo was not entitled to the safe harbor.\n\nOn September 18, 2013, the district court issued a summary judgment decision. It held that Vimeo did not have the \"right and ability to control\" the infringing material within the meaning of \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B) and therefore was not excluded from the safe harbor on that ground. It further held that as to 55 of the 199 original videos \u2013 those with which Vimeo employees had interacted \u2013 there was a triable issue of fact as to whether Vimeo had actual or \"red flag\" knowledge of infringement, and thus summary judgment could not be granted to Vimeo for those videos. For 144 videos containing pre\u20111972 sound recordings, the court granted partial summary judgment to plaintiffs, reasoning that the DMCA safe harbor did not apply to pre\u20111972 recordings. It granted summary judgment to Vimeo on the remaining videos.\n\nOn reconsideration, the district court granted summary judgment to Vimeo with respect to an additional 17 videos. It then granted plaintiffs leave to amend and add 1,476 videos to the case. The court certified three questions for interlocutory appeal to the Second Circuit: (1) whether the DMCA safe harbor applies to pre\u20111972 sound recordings; (2) whether Vimeo had knowledge or awareness of infringing content (actual or red flag knowledge); and (3) whether Vimeo had a general policy of willful blindness to infringement of sound recordings.\n\nOn interlocutory appeal (Capitol Records, LLC v. Vimeo, LLC (\"Vimeo I\")), the Second Circuit held that the DMCA safe harbor extends to pre\u20111972 recordings and vacated the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to plaintiffs on the pre\u20111972 videos. It also vacated the denial of summary judgment to Vimeo on red flag knowledge and articulated a standard for red flag knowledge, indicating that Vimeo would be entitled to summary judgment unless plaintiffs could present evidence that Vimeo personnel either knew a particular video was infringing or knew facts that would make infringement obvious to an ordinary person without specialized knowledge of music or copyright law. The court also affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that Vimeo was not willfully blind to infringement.\n\nOn remand, the parties identified 307 videos remaining in dispute and renewed cross\u2011motions for summary judgment. Applying the standard articulated in Vimeo I, the district court granted Vimeo summary judgment on 281 videos, holding that plaintiffs had failed to show that Vimeo had red flag knowledge of infringement for those videos. It further held that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding 26 videos that had been uploaded by Vimeo employees, concerning their eligibility for the safe harbor (including whether they were stored \"at the direction of a user\").

          "On knowledge and red flag awareness, plaintiffs argue that Vimeo had awareness of facts and circumstances from which infringing activity was apparent for the 281 videos\u2011in\u2011suit with which its employees interacted. They contend that employees watched, commented on, liked, promoted, or categorized videos that plainly contained popular, copyrighted sound recordings owned or controlled by plaintiffs, and that an ordinary person in the employees\u2019 position would have recognized the infringing nature of the use. Plaintiffs point to Vimeo\u2019s internal and public statements that using third\u2011party copyrighted music without permission \"generally\" constitutes infringement, and to evidence that some Vimeo employees themselves posted videos with copyrighted background music without licenses and were later instructed by Vimeo\u2019s legal team not to do so, as demonstrating that staff had particular experience and awareness regarding music licensing and the infringing character of such uses.",
          "Plaintiffs further argue that Vimeo\u2019s 2008 cease\u2011and\u2011desist correspondence from EMI, listing specific infringing videos and demanding removal of all EMI\u2011owned or \u2011controlled works, put Vimeo on specific notice that user\u2011uploaded videos containing EMI\u2019s music were unauthorized. They analogize to EMI Christian Music Grp., Inc. v. MP3tunes, LLC, asserting that once Vimeo was subjectively aware that EMI had not authorized digital distribution of its catalog on Vimeo, the presence of EMI\u2011owned recordings in user videos rendered the infringement objectively obvious. Plaintiffs also rely on Vimeo\u2019s 2011 blog post acknowledging that music licensing is \"confusing\" and \"painful\" as evidence that Vimeo knew many users would not have gone through the licensing process, making unlicensed use apparent.",
          "On fair use, plaintiffs maintain that Vimeo personnel had sufficient \"legal acumen\" about copyright law, based on company training and scripted communications with users, to understand that commonplace uses such as lip\u2011synching, dancing, and other background uses of full musical tracks in user videos are not fair use in typical circumstances. They contend that when employees viewed and curated videos embodying such uses of well\u2011known sound recordings, infringement would have been apparent to a reasonable Vimeo employee, satisfying the red flag standard.",
          "On the \"right and ability to control\" issue, plaintiffs embrace the \"substantial influence\" standard and argue that Vimeo\u2019s editorial and curatorial activities over user content meet or exceed that threshold. They emphasize that Vimeo exercises editorial judgment by evaluating and promoting certain user videos (e.g., via Staff Picks, blog features, and featured channels) and demoting or removing other videos, actively shaping what content is highlighted and how users experience the platform. They characterize this editorial judgment as being directed at the same user activity that gives rise to infringement\u2014user uploads of videos with copyrighted music\u2014and argue that Vimeo\u2019s influence over which videos are visible, desirable, or permitted alters user incentives and effectively controls infringing activity.",
          "Plaintiffs also stress Vimeo\u2019s content rules that prohibit non\u2011original content (e.g., movies, TV, trailers, and most gameplay videos) while encouraging other popular formats such as lip\u2011dub videos. They argue that these rules show Vimeo exerting a higher level of control than simple host neutrality, akin to the control found sufficient in Cybernet. They maintain that Vimeo\u2019s use of Mod Tools to surface and review videos with certain characteristics, coupled with human moderation decisions, demonstrates ongoing, systematic oversight of user submissions, which, when combined with Vimeo\u2019s economic interest in attracting and retaining users via attractive content, amounts to \"substantial influence\" over infringing activity.",
          "Regarding financial benefit, plaintiffs allege that Vimeo profits directly from the presence and popularity of infringing videos because such content attracts users, encourages subscription upgrades, increases site traffic, and generates associated advertising revenue. They argue that where infringing videos are featured, promoted, or allowed to remain on the platform under Vimeo\u2019s editorial control, the resulting viewership and monetization represent financial benefits directly attributable to the infringing activity within the meaning of \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B)."

          "On knowledge and red flag awareness, Vimeo contends that plaintiffs bear the burden of showing loss of safe harbor and have not met it. Vimeo does not dispute that its employees knew that the videos contained copyrighted music, but it argues that under Vimeo I and Viacom, that is insufficient. Vimeo maintains that plaintiffs have not shown that any Vimeo employee actually knew a particular video was infringing or was aware of facts making infringement objectively obvious to an ordinary person without specialized knowledge of music or copyright law. Vimeo emphasizes that its employees are not required by the DMCA to investigate or verify if a particular use is licensed or fair use, and that knowledge of general licensing difficulties or industry practices does not make lack of authorization obvious for any specific video.",
          "Vimeo argues that the existence of its licensed music store beginning in 2011 means that a reasonable Vimeo employee could not assume that user\u2011uploaded videos with music were unlicensed; users had a mechanism to purchase licenses, and some users claimed to have obtained authorization directly from rightsholders. Vimeo asserts that even if EMI\u2019s 2008 cease\u2011and\u2011desist letter put it on notice that certain listed videos were infringing, it did not establish that all future uses of EMI music lacked authorization, particularly given the possibility of later licensing arrangements. Vimeo relies on the DMCA\u2019s \u00a7 512(m) provision, which states that service providers have no general duty to monitor or affirmatively seek facts indicating infringing activity, and contends that plaintiffs\u2019 theory would effectively impose such a duty.",
          "With respect to fair use, Vimeo maintains that its employees, who do not possess specialized legal training, cannot reasonably be expected to distinguish reliably between infringing uses and potential fair uses of copyrighted music in user videos. Vimeo asserts that any general internal guidance or scripted user responses about copyright risks do not transform its staff into copyright experts capable of immediately identifying infringement, especially in legal areas where reasonable experts and courts themselves may disagree. Vimeo therefore argues that plaintiffs have not shown that employees had awareness of facts making infringement, as opposed to potential fair use or licensed use, objectively obvious for the videos\u2011in\u2011suit.",
          "On the \"right and ability to control\" element, Vimeo argues that its capabilities and practices fall far short of the \"substantial influence\" standard identified in Viacom. Vimeo concedes that it can and does remove or block content, but it asserts that mere ability to remove content, or general content restrictions, are insufficient as a matter of law to constitute the requisite control. Vimeo distinguishes its operations from the more intrusive regimes in cases like Cybernet and Mavrix, where the service provider dictated site layout, pre\u2011screened every user submission, and rejected a large portion of them. Vimeo notes that it does not pre\u2011approve all user uploads and that its curation activities\u2014such as liking videos, adding them to Staff Picks, or featuring them\u2014affect only a very small fraction of the millions of videos uploaded and do not constrain what users may upload in the first instance.",
          "Vimeo maintains that its content rules (e.g., prohibiting movies, TV shows, trailers, pornography, and most gameplay videos; requiring that content be at least partly user\u2011created) are standard site\u2011maintenance and brand\u2011defining measures, not exercises of control over infringement. It argues that such rules are aimed at avoiding illegality and tailoring the platform\u2019s aesthetic and audience appeal, not directing or controlling infringing activity. Vimeo also asserts that its Mod Tools focus on characteristics such as video length or popularity, not on specific infringing content, and that monitoring for limited categories of prohibited content does not amount to the type of comprehensive, coercive guidance or pre\u2011screening that would constitute substantial influence over user activities.\n",
          "Regarding financial benefit, Vimeo does not dispute that it earns revenue from subscriptions and advertisements connected to overall site traffic, but it argues that plaintiffs have not shown a \"financial benefit directly attributable to\" any specific infringing activity. Vimeo contends that its revenue is driven by the general operation of the service and user engagement across millions of videos, not by particular infringing videos, and that any benefit is too attenuated to meet the statutory requirement, especially absent the predicate showing that it had the right and ability to control the infringing activity as defined by \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B)."

          "reasoning":"The question is whether plaintiffs produced sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact on Vimeo\u2019s actual or red-flag knowledge for the 281 user\u2011uploaded videos, under the red\u2011flag standard articulated in Viacom and refined in Vimeo I. That is a summary\u2011judgment question of law, reviewed de novo.\n\nVimeo I already held that (1) generalized awareness that infringement occurs on the service and (2) awareness that videos contain copyrighted music are not enough; plaintiffs must show Vimeo personnel knew a specific video was infringing or were aware of facts making its infringing nature obvious to an ordinary person without specialized copyright knowledge. Vimeo I also stressed that the DMCA imposes no duty to monitor or investigate and that red\u2011flag knowledge cannot be premised on assumptions about licensing in the industry.\n\nHere, plaintiffs principally rely on: employee \u2018likes,\u2019 comments, or curation of the videos; the obvious presence of well\u2011known sound recordings; the 2008 EMI cease\u2011and\u2011desist letter; Vimeo staff\u2019s general familiarity with licensing problems; and isolated \u2018off\u2011the\u2011record\u2019 comments by employees. None of that, as to the 281 videos, shows that any particular employee actually knew the use was unauthorized or that the facts visible on the face of the video made infringement\u2014not merely use of copyrighted music\u2014objectively obvious. Under Vimeo I, an ordinary Vimeo employee could not, without more, infer lack of a license or lack of fair use simply from the presence of a popular song, especially after Vimeo had introduced a mechanism for users to obtain licenses and where some users claimed to have permissions. EMI\u2019s 2008 letter specifically identified certain videos (which Vimeo removed) but did not transform every subsequent posting of EMI music into obvious infringement as a matter of law, particularly given the possibility of later licensing deals.\n\nThe district court applied the Vimeo I standard and concluded that, for these 281 videos (which, notably, excluded employee\u2011uploaded videos), plaintiffs\u2019 evidence did not rise above generalized inferences and did not identify video\u2011specific facts that would compel an ordinary person to recognize obvious infringement. Given the heavy guidance in Vimeo I and the DMCA\u2019s \u00a7 512(m) no\u2011monitoring principle, that conclusion is well within the governing precedent. The appellate court is likely to hold that plaintiffs have failed, as a matter of law, to carry their burden to show loss of safe harbor via actual or red\u2011flag knowledge and therefore affirm summary judgment on this ground."

Routine content policies, discretionary curation of a small subset of content, and use of tools to detect rule\u2011violating content fall short of that threshold.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 arguments focus on Vimeo\u2019s editorial and curatorial activities (Staff Picks, featured channels, likes, comments), content rules (forbidding certain categories while fostering user\u2011created formats like lip\u2011dubs), and Mod Tools used to surface potentially problematic material. But those are, in substance, typical platform\u2011governance and brand\u2011management functions. Vimeo does not dictate the substance of user submissions, require pre\u2011approval of all uploads, design or operate users\u2019 own sites, or condition participation on a detailed, coercive content program as in Cybernet. Nor is there evidence of inducement of copyright infringement comparable to Grokster; encouraging a user\u2011created lip\u2011dub genre is not the same as encouraging unlicensed use of copyrighted music.\n\nBecause plaintiffs cannot show the requisite \u2018substantial influence\u2019 over infringing activity, they cannot satisfy the control prong of \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B). That alone defeats their attempt to disqualify Vimeo from the safe harbor on this ground. In addition, their financial\u2011benefit theory is highly attenuated\u2014Vimeo\u2019s revenues derive from overall site usage rather than specific infringing videos, and plaintiffs point to no evidence tying particular infringements to discrete revenue streams. The appellate court is likely to agree that plaintiffs have not adduced evidence from which a reasonable jury could find both \u2018right and ability to control\u2019 in the Viacom sense and a \u2018financial benefit directly attributable\u2019 to the infringing activity. Accordingly, summary judgment on this issue is properly affirmed."

      "reasoning":"The case is a remand from an earlier Second Circuit decision (Vimeo I) that already set a stringent framework favoring service\u2011provider immunity for user\u2011generated content platforms absent specific evidence of actual or red\u2011flag knowledge or substantial control. The district court\u2019s post\u2011remand judgment closely tracked that guidance: it excluded the employee\u2011uploaded videos (where safe\u2011harbor eligibility remained factually disputed), and granted summary judgment only on the remaining 281 user\u2011uploaded videos where plaintiffs relied on generalized inferences about licensing and employee sophistication.\n\nUnder Vimeo I, those generalized inferences about industry practices, obviousness of popular music, and internal awareness of licensing issues are insufficient to satisfy plaintiffs\u2019 burden to show loss of safe harbor. The DMCA\u2019s explicit no\u2011monitoring rule (\u00a7 512(m)) further undercuts any argument that Vimeo was obliged to assume non\u2011licensing and investigate each instance of copyrighted music. As to \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B), Viacom and the cited analogues (Cybernet, Mavrix) define \u2018right and ability to control\u2019 narrowly, requiring a level of pre\u2011screening, direction, or inducement that Vimeo\u2019s relatively modest curation, content guidelines, and automated tools do not reach. Given these precedents and the procedural posture (summary judgment after remand with clear appellate instructions), the more likely outcome is that the appellate court affirms the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on both knowledge and control grounds, leaving Vimeo within the DMCA safe harbor for the 281 user\u2011uploaded videos at issue."

      },
      "factual_background":"Atmel Corporation, a technology company, anticipated a potential merger and created an employee severance benefits plan (the \"Plan\") governed by ERISA. The Plan promised significant cash severance intended, according to Atmel\u2019s communications to employees, to \"ease concerns\" about job security in the event of a corporate transaction.\n\nThe Plan\u2019s severance benefits were contingent on several conditions. First, the Plan would expire on November 1, 2015, unless an \"Initial Triggering Event\" occurred prior to that date. An Initial Triggering Event was defined to occur only if Atmel entered into a definitive agreement on or before November 1, 2015, that would result in a \"Change of Control\" of the company. If an Initial Triggering Event occurred by that deadline, the Plan would remain in effect for the next eighteen months. Second, assuming an Initial Triggering Event occurred, employees could receive benefits only if (A) a Change of Control actually occurred, and (B) their employment was terminated without \"Cause\" by Atmel or its successor within 18 months of the execution date of the definitive agreement. A key interpretive dispute later arose over whether the eventual Change of Control had to involve the same company with which Atmel entered into a definitive agreement on or before November 1, 2015.\n\nIn September 2015, Atmel entered into a definitive agreement with Dialog Semiconductor for Dialog to acquire Atmel. This agreement was reached before the November 1, 2015 Plan deadline. Before that merger closed, Microchip Technology Inc. submitted a competing acquisition offer. In January 2016, Atmel agreed to be acquired by Microchip instead. Between the Dialog agreement and the announcement of the Microchip agreement, an Atmel human resources executive told employees that the Plan would provide benefits for those terminated without Cause in connection with a Change of Control of the company, explicitly including an acquisition by either Dialog or Microchip. After the Microchip agreement was reached, Atmel\u2019s human resources department circulated a \"Frequently Asked Questions\" document, evidence of record indicating that Microchip reviewed and approved it, which stated that Microchip would honor the Atmel Plan. Microchip\u2019s merger with Atmel closed in April 2016.\n\nSoon after the merger closed, Microchip terminated Peter Schuman and William Coplin, without cause. At that time, Microchip did not offer them the severance benefits they contend were promised under the Plan. Instead, Microchip offered severance packages that Schuman and Coplin allege were significantly lower than those Plan benefits. As a condition of receiving these lesser payments, Microchip required them to sign releases of all potential claims. Letters accompanying the proposed releases stated that Atmel and Microchip were making the offer \"in part to resolve any current disagreement or misunderstanding regarding severance benefits previously offered\" by Atmel. Microchip informed Atmel employees that the more generous benefits under the Plan were not available because the Plan had expired. Microchip\u2019s position was that the Plan expired when the Dialog transaction\u2014which had been the definitive agreement entered into before November 1, 2015\u2014failed to result in a finalized merger, and that the subsequent Microchip transaction therefore did not trigger Plan benefits. Schuman and Coplin signed the releases.\n\nSchuman and Coplin later took the position that, contrary to Microchip\u2019s representations, the Plan had not expired and remained in effect at the time of the Microchip transaction and their terminations. They allege that Microchip, as a fiduciary, knew or should have known that the Plan still applied and that its representations to the contrary, and its obtaining of releases in exchange for lesser payments, constituted a breach of ERISA fiduciary duties. They also contend the releases are unenforceable under ERISA for those reasons.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Schuman and Coplin filed a class-action complaint against Microchip Technology Inc., Atmel Corporation, and the Atmel Corporation U.S. Severance Guarantee Benefit Program, on behalf of approximately 200 similarly situated former Atmel employees who had also signed releases. The complaint alleged violations of ERISA, including breach of fiduciary duty and denial of benefits, and challenged the enforceability of the releases that class members signed in exchange for reduced severance benefits. According to the district court\u2019s description, Schuman and Coplin alleged that Microchip breached its fiduciary duties by misinterpreting the Plan as having expired and by encouraging them and other employees to sign releases in exchange for reduced severance while Microchip allegedly knew or should have known that the Plan remained valid and that employees were still entitled to more generous benefits.\n\nIn a separate but related action, a group of nine former Atmel employees who had not signed releases also sued Microchip, alleging similar ERISA violations, including denial of benefits and breach of fiduciary duty based on Microchip\u2019s interpretation and administration of the Plan.",
        "district_court_decision":"In the separate action brought by nine employees who had not signed releases (Berman v. Microchip), the district court initially found that the Plan\u2019s key language regarding \"Change of Control\" and \"definitive agreement\" unambiguously meant that the Plan had not expired by the time of the Microchip merger and that Microchip had breached its fiduciary duties. On interlocutory appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that the Plan language was ambiguous and remanded for further proceedings to resolve its meaning; that case later settled, leaving the Plan\u2019s definitive interpretation unresolved.\n\nIn the Schuman\/Coplin class action, the district court certified a class of approximately 220 members (with later discovery showing that five of those members had not in fact signed releases, an issue the court recognized remained unresolved). The case was stayed pending the expected trial in Berman. After Berman settled, Microchip renewed its motion for summary judgment in the Schuman\/Coplin case. Microchip argued, per the district court\u2019s description, that Schuman and Coplin had knowingly and voluntarily waived their rights to pursue Plan claims and that those releases disposed of the named plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA claims. Schuman and Coplin argued that even if their execution of the releases was knowing and voluntary in a traditional sense, the releases were nonetheless unenforceable because Microchip violated its ERISA fiduciary duties by obtaining the releases in exchange for sharply reduced severance payments while misrepresenting the availability of Plan benefits.\n\nThe district court adopted and applied a six-factor \"knowing and voluntary\" test used by the First and Second Circuits (considering the employee\u2019s education and business sophistication; the roles of the employer and employee in determining the waiver\u2019s provisions; the clarity of the agreement; the time to study the agreement; whether the employee had independent advice such as counsel; and the consideration for the waiver). Using these six factors and evaluating the \"totality of the circumstances\" in that framework, the court concluded that Schuman and Coplin understood the terms and consequences of the releases and signed them willingly. In applying this test, the district court expressly did not consider evidence of Microchip\u2019s alleged breach of fiduciary duties or alleged improper conduct in obtaining the releases as part of the totality analysis. On that basis, the court granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs Schuman and Coplin and in favor of Microchip on their claims.\n\nAs to the non-named class members who had signed releases, the district court found that the six-factor test was too individualized to allow a class\u2011wide determination that all releases were knowing and voluntary. Because class certification had been premised in part on treating the enforceability of releases on a class\u2011wide basis and because the parties had not briefed that six-factor test at the certification stage, the court ordered the parties to show cause why the class should or should not be decertified.\n\nSeparately, for the class members (including some non-named plaintiffs) asserting breach-of-fiduciary-duty claims, the district court addressed whether Microchip breached its fiduciary duties by misinterpreting the Plan as expired when it allegedly knew or should have known the Plan remained in effect. The court found there was at least one material factual dispute about Microchip\u2019s knowledge of the Plan and its intended interpretation and therefore denied Microchip\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to those non-named plaintiffs\u2019 fiduciary-duty claims.\n\nThe district court then entered a partial final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) in favor of Microchip and against Schuman and Coplin. It certified for appellate review the legal question of what standard should apply to determine the enforceability of the releases signed by Schuman, Coplin, and most class members. The court explained it needed guidance on whether it had properly adopted the First\/Second Circuit six\u2011factor test or should instead have considered Microchip\u2019s alleged fiduciary breach in its enforceability analysis. The court stayed the remainder of the case, including issues concerning non-named class members and potential decertification, pending appeal.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Schuman and Coplin appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against them based on the enforceability of their releases, and specifically the district court\u2019s adoption and application of the six\u2011factor \"knowing and voluntary\" test that did not include consideration of allegedly improper fiduciary conduct. The district court certified for appeal the question of what legal test the court should apply in determining the enforceability of ERISA releases like those signed by Schuman and Coplin and the majority of class members.\n\nMicrochip cross\u2011appeals the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment as to the non-named plaintiffs and the accompanying conclusion that the judgment against Schuman and Coplin did not automatically extinguish the claims of the unnamed class members.

Fiduciary duties under ERISA incorporate common-law trust principles, including the duty of loyalty, a duty to disclose accurate and material information, and a duty to deal fairly with beneficiaries. Courts evaluating releases of ERISA claims examine whether the waiver is knowing and voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. Various circuits have adopted multi-factor tests for this inquiry: the First and Second Circuits use a non-exhaustive six-factor test focusing on education and sophistication, role in negotiating the waiver, clarity of the agreement, time to review, access to counsel, and consideration; the Seventh and Eighth Circuits employ eight- or nine-factor tests that include these elements and additionally require consideration of improper fiduciary conduct and the employee\u2019s knowledge of rights under the plan. Prior Ninth Circuit precedent (e.g., Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp.) suggested, without resolving, that waivers of ERISA claims must withstand \"special scrutiny designed to prevent potential employer or fiduciary abuse\" and must be knowing and voluntary."

They contend that ERISA requires \"special scrutiny\" of waivers of ERISA claims to prevent employer or fiduciary abuse and that this scrutiny must include consideration of any alleged breach of fiduciary duty or improper conduct by the fiduciary in connection with obtaining the release. By adopting the First\/Second Circuit six\u2011factor test without any express consideration of fiduciary misconduct or misrepresentations about Plan status, the district court, in their view, failed to account for core ERISA fiduciary obligations, such as the duty to disclose material information and to act solely in participants\u2019 interests.",
          "They assert that Microchip breached its fiduciary duties by misinterpreting the Plan as expired, or at least by taking a position on Plan expiration that it knew or should have known was incorrect, and by representing to employees that the Plan benefits were unavailable while simultaneously obtaining broad releases in exchange for reduced severance. They claim that Microchip had earlier communications\u2014including the HR executive\u2019s assurances and the FAQ document\u2014that indicated the Plan would be honored in connection with a Dialog or Microchip acquisition, and that this history undercuts Microchip\u2019s later position that the Plan had expired. In their view, this alleged misconduct and the resulting informational imbalance must be part of the court\u2019s evaluation of whether the releases were truly knowing and voluntary.",
          "Schuman and Coplin also argue that the enforceability of releases in a class context must recognize that employees relied on the employer\u2019s representations about Plan validity and benefits, and that a purely individualized voluntariness test that ignores fiduciary breaches undermines ERISA\u2019s protective purposes. They urge adoption of a test similar to that used by the Seventh and Eighth Circuits, which explicitly require courts to consider whether the release was induced by improper fiduciary conduct and whether employees were aware of their rights and relevant facts when they signed.",

They do not argue in favor of extending appellate jurisdiction to Microchip\u2019s cross\u2011appeal and take the position that Microchip\u2019s attempt to litigate class\u2011wide issues regarding unnamed plaintiffs\u2019 claims is beyond the scope of the certified order."

Microchip contends that nothing in ERISA requires courts to collapse the separate inquiries of fiduciary breach and waiver enforceability or to adopt a special, threshold invalidity rule whenever breach is alleged. It maintains that courts may assess whether a release is enforceable under a traditional voluntariness analysis and that alleged fiduciary breaches can be addressed, if necessary, through separate substantive ERISA claims.",
          "Microchip asserts that Schuman and Coplin are well-educated, experienced professionals, that the release language was clear, that they had time to consider the agreements and the opportunity to consult counsel, and that they received consideration for the releases. In Microchip\u2019s view, these and the other factors demonstrate that the releases were knowingly and voluntarily executed. Microchip therefore supports the district court\u2019s decision to treat the releases as valid to bar the named plaintiffs\u2019 ERISA claims, without interjecting a separate \"improper conduct\" factor into the voluntariness analysis.",

Microchip suggests that the claims are interrelated and should be reviewed together rather than through an interlocutory appeal based on a partial judgment.",

Microchip contends that once the district court concluded that the named plaintiffs\u2019 releases were enforceable, that determination should have been given class\u2011wide effect, extinguishing the claims of members who executed the same or substantially similar releases. To obtain appellate review now, Microchip invokes pendent appellate jurisdiction and the collateral order doctrine, arguing that the effect of the named plaintiffs\u2019 judgment on the unnamed class members is sufficiently intertwined with, or effectively determined by, the enforceability question presented on appeal."

          "reasoning":"The question is purely legal: what test governs enforceability of ERISA waivers. Under ERISA and Ninth Circuit precedent (e.g., Vizcaino) waivers of ERISA rights must receive \u2018special scrutiny\u2019 to guard against fiduciary abuse and are evaluated under a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. Other circuits\u2019 multifactor tests are expressly non\u2011exhaustive, and the Seventh and Eighth Circuits specifically require courts to consider whether the release was induced by improper conduct and whether the employee knew of pertinent rights and facts. Here, the district court expressly declined to consider alleged fiduciary misconduct or misrepresentation in its totality analysis and limited itself to the six First\/Second Circuit factors. That approach is in tension with ERISA\u2019s core fiduciary obligations\u2014the duty of loyalty, accurate disclosure, and fair dealing\u2014and with the notion of \u2018special scrutiny\u2019 of ERISA waivers. A standard that ignores whether the fiduciary misled participants about the very benefits being released cannot be reconciled with those principles. The appellate court is likely to hold that, at minimum, the totality inquiry must include whether the release was tainted by a breach of fiduciary duty or material misrepresentation in obtaining it. Because the district court applied an incomplete legal standard and granted summary judgment on that basis, the judgment enforcing Schuman and Coplin\u2019s releases must be reversed and remanded for application of the correct standard."

The remaining claims (principally those of unnamed class members and a handful of individuals whose release status is disputed) turn on similar factual background but are not identical; they involve separate parties and will require individualized application of the voluntariness standard, even under an expanded totality test that includes fiduciary misconduct. The certified question\u2014what legal standard governs the enforceability of ERISA releases\u2014is a discrete, controlling legal issue whose resolution will materially shape the remaining proceedings (class scope, decertification, and merits). Early resolution serves judicial economy by avoiding potentially massive, misdirected factual development if the wrong legal standard were applied. Under Curtiss\u2011Wright and Ninth Circuit cases like Noel and Wood, the district court\u2019s assessment that there was \u2018no just reason for delay\u2019 is within the range of reasonable case\u2011management judgments, and the risk of truly duplicative piecemeal appeals is limited because once the legal standard is clarified, subsequent appeals will address its application to different parties, not relitigation of the standard itself.

Pendent appellate jurisdiction is narrow in the Ninth Circuit; it applies only when the otherwise nonappealable issue is inextricably intertwined with, or necessary to resolve, the issue properly before the court. Here, the legal standard for enforceability of ERISA releases (issue 1) can be decided without determining whether summary judgment should have been granted as to all class members or whether the named\u2011plaintiff judgment has automatic class\u2011wide preclusive effect.

      "reasoning":"The core merits holding\u2014the standard for evaluating ERISA releases\u2014is very likely to be reversed. The district court adopted a six\u2011factor \u2018knowing and voluntary\u2019 test but expressly refused to consider alleged fiduciary misrepresentation and misuse of informational asymmetry, even though ERISA fiduciary law and prior Ninth Circuit hints in Vizcaino call for special scrutiny of waivers and emphasize fiduciaries\u2019 duties of loyalty and truthful disclosure. Other circuits\u2019 more expansive multifactor approaches and trust\u2011law principles further support requiring courts to address whether the waiver was procured through fiduciary breach or material misrepresentation as part of the totality analysis. Applying the wrong legal standard on summary judgment compels reversal and remand. \n\nOn jurisdiction, however, the district court\u2019s Rule 54(b) certification is supported by precedent: Schuman and Coplin\u2019s claims are conclusively resolved, and the legal standard for waiver enforceability is distinct and controlling; immediate review advances efficiency, and the district court\u2019s \u2018no just reason for delay\u2019 finding is not an abuse of discretion. Thus appellate jurisdiction properly exists over the named\u2011plaintiff judgment. By contrast, Microchip\u2019s effort to obtain immediate review of the denial of summary judgment as to unnamed class members and the class\u2011wide effect of the releases does not satisfy the stringent requirements for pendent appellate or collateral\u2011order jurisdiction; those issues are not necessary to decide the certified legal standard and may be reviewed after final judgment. The likely result, therefore, is a mixed disposition: (1) reversal of the summary judgment enforcing Schuman and Coplin\u2019s releases and remand with instructions to apply a totality\u2011of\u2011the\u2011circumstances standard that includes potential fiduciary misconduct; (2) affirmance of the propriety of Rule 54(b) certification; and (3) dismissal of Microchip\u2019s cross\u2011appeal for lack of jurisdiction."

      "factual_background":"Beginning around 2004, two Massachusetts state forensic chemists, Annie Dookhan and Sonja Farak, engaged in criminal misconduct in state drug laboratories. Their conduct included tampering with drug evidence, falsifying drug test results, and committing perjury in state drug prosecutions. This misconduct lasted for approximately a decade and affected tens of thousands of drug cases.\n\nOnce Farak\u2019s and Dookhan\u2019s misconduct was uncovered, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) undertook systemic remedial measures in the state criminal system. Over 30,000 criminal drug convictions tainted by the chemists\u2019 misconduct were vacated and dismissed with prejudice.\n\nTwo individuals whose convictions had been vacated because of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct litigated, in state court, federal due process claims seeking return of various monetary exactions and assets linked to their now-invalid criminal convictions. They demanded the return of fees, victim-witness assessments, restitution, fines, and court costs, as well as of any property that had been seized and forfeited under Massachusetts\u2019s civil forfeiture statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, \u00a7 47 (the \u201cState Act\u201d). In Commonwealth v. Martinez, the SJC determined that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause required automatic repayment of most monetary amounts collected as a consequence of the now-vacated convictions, but did not require the automatic return of property forfeited in civil forfeiture proceedings.\n\nWith respect to forfeited assets, the SJC reasoned that forfeiture judgments obtained under the civil statute were not simply a direct consequence of the criminal convictions because the forfeiture orders were based on a separate finding\u2014probable cause of a nexus between the property and drug activity\u2014which did not depend on a criminal finding of guilt. As a result, the court held that individuals seeking to undo forfeiture judgments and recover forfeited property must pursue individualized relief by filing motions for relief from judgment under Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), rather than receiving automatic return of property. The Martinez plaintiffs did not seek certiorari review of that decision in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the present federal case are individuals whose drug convictions were among those vacated due to the chemists\u2019 misconduct and who had property forfeited under the State Act in connection with their drug cases. They contend that, even after their convictions were vacated, state and local officials have continued to withhold their previously forfeited property. They assert that this continued withholding violates the Eighth Amendment (excessive fines) and the Fourteenth Amendment (due process), particularly in light of the SJC\u2019s mass vacatur of their underlying criminal convictions. The plaintiffs are dissatisfied with the SJC\u2019s Martinez ruling insofar as it did not mandate automatic return of forfeited property and instead required Rule 60(b) motions, and they seek federal relief that would effectively secure the automatic return of forfeited assets and additional procedural protections beyond what Martinez provided.\n\nThe defendants in this federal action, as relevant on appeal, are statewide and county-level criminal justice officials and court and police leadership: the Massachusetts Attorney General, the eleven elected District Attorneys, the Administrator of the Massachusetts Trial Court, and the Interim Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police. Four local police departments were also named in the original complaint as representative defendants for a broader group of similarly situated law enforcement agencies, but those entities were dismissed from the case by the district court and are not involved in the present appeal.",

        "claims_brought":"Plaintiffs filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against various state and local officials and entities, including the Massachusetts Attorney General, eleven county District Attorneys, the Administrator of the Trial Court, the Interim Superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, and four local police departments (Brockton, Fall River, Boston, and Springfield Police Departments, the latter four as representatives of all similarly situated police departments). The plaintiffs alleged constitutional violations arising from the continued withholding of property forfeited under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94C, \u00a7 47, after their drug convictions were vacated.\n\nTheir complaint asserted that this continued withholding of forfeited property violated the Eighth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment and sought multiple forms of declaratory and injunctive relief, including: (i) a declaratory judgment that class members are entitled to the return of all forfeited property taken from them in connection with their vacated convictions; and injunctions ordering (ii) the return of all such forfeited property, (iii) notice to all class members, (iv) a full accounting of all forfeited property, and (v) the implementation of an 'efficient, effective, and fair process' to return forfeited property.\n\nThe claims against the local police departments were analyzed under Monell v. Department of Social Services of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). The district court dismissed the claims against these local departments, and plaintiffs did not pursue an interlocutory cross-appeal of that Monell ruling (a cross-appeal initially filed was not pursued). Thus, the operative controversy on appeal involves only the Commonwealth-level defendants.",
        "district_court_decision":"The Commonwealth defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on multiple grounds, prominently asserting Eleventh Amendment immunity and also raising other defenses. The district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part.\n\nThe court held that, under the Eleventh Amendment, it lacked authority to issue an injunction directly ordering the return of forfeited property, i.e., it could not compel the payment or restoration of such property from the state. Accordingly, it dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claim for an injunction mandating the return of all forfeited property on Eleventh Amendment grounds.\n\nHowever, the district court concluded that other aspects of the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief could proceed under the Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity. The court determined that it could entertain plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenges and potentially order non-monetary, forward-looking relief, such as: (1) notification to class members of their rights under the State Act or to pursue relief under Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b); (2) a full accounting of all forfeited property; and (3) additional procedural due process protections in connection with Rule 60(b) hearings in state court. The court regarded these forms of relief as prospective injunctive remedies not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The court did not explicitly rule out plaintiffs\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment; instead, it noted that it was not barred from hearing constitutional challenges insofar as plaintiffs sought relief other than an order directing the payment of money from the state treasury, and the parties proceeded on the understanding that the declaratory-judgment claim survived the partial dismissal.",

          "Regarding the connection of the named defendants to the challenged practices, plaintiffs argue that the Attorney General, District Attorneys, Trial Court Administrator, and State Police leadership are appropriate Ex parte Young defendants because they play central roles in enforcing the forfeiture regime, administering forfeiture proceeds, and participating in or influencing the processes by which forfeiture judgments are pursued, maintained, and potentially vacated. They maintain that these officials have sufficient authority to implement the notice, accounting, and procedural changes sought, or at least to cease participating in or perpetuating the alleged constitutional violations.",
          "Plaintiffs also emphasize that the SJC\u2019s Martinez decision, requiring individualized Rule 60(b) motions for relief from forfeiture judgments, is inadequate to protect their federal constitutional rights without the additional procedural safeguards and systemic remedies they seek, and they therefore urge that federal equitable intervention is appropriate within the limits of Ex parte Young."

The plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury flows from past forfeiture judgments and the state courts\u2019 past decisions not to vacate those judgments automatically. Under Edelman and Papasan, the mere continued non-payment or non-return of money or property said to be owed as a result of past conduct is treated as a past violation, not an ongoing one. Here, the state\u2019s present possession of forfeited property is the continuing effect of completed state-court forfeiture orders, not an ongoing enforcement of an unconstitutional statute or policy. The SJC has already prescribed the available remedial process (Rule 60(b)) and expressly declined to require automatic return of forfeited assets. That structure confirms that, in substance, plaintiffs seek retrospective correction of past forfeiture outcomes. Because the complaint does not plausibly allege an ongoing violation of federal law within Ex parte Young\u2019s meaning, the Eleventh Amendment bars these claims."

Even assuming a federal violation were adequately alleged, the relief sought\u2014class-wide notice, a full historical accounting of forfeited property, an order to create a process to return property, and a declaratory judgment that class members are entitled to return of forfeited assets\u2014is predominantly backward-looking. Each remedy is structured to unwind past forfeitures and to facilitate restitution of property already taken, not to govern defendants\u2019 future conduct independent of those past events. Under Edelman, an injunction compelling the state to make restitution for past conduct is barred even if framed as prospective. Under Green v. Mansour, a declaratory judgment that would effectively fix past liability to be used in subsequent state proceedings is likewise impermissible. And unlike in Quern v. Jordan, there is no valid, independent prospective injunction here to which \u2018ancillary\u2019 notice or accounting could attach. Thus, all of the surviving forms of relief identified by the district court are barred by the Eleventh Amendment."

          "reasoning":"Whether particular state officials have the requisite \u2018some connection\u2019 to the enforcement of the challenged practice is a legal question reviewed de novo on a motion to dismiss. The challenged procedures concern Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and the conduct of state-court forfeiture-relief proceedings\u2014matters committed to the state judiciary and the SJC\u2019s rulemaking authority, not to the executive officials named here. The Attorney General, District Attorneys, Trial Court Administrator, and State Police lack authority to alter Rule 60(b) standards or to impose the systemic procedural changes plaintiffs seek in state-court processes. Enjoining these officials would not plausibly redress the alleged due process deficiencies in Rule 60(b) proceedings, so naming them is effectively a suit against the state itself. Under Ex parte Young, this absence of a meaningful enforcement or policymaking connection precludes proceeding against these defendants. The district court therefore erred in allowing the claims for additional procedural protections (and related relief) to go forward against them."

      },
      "overall_outcome":"REVERSE",
      "confidence":0.82,
      "reasoning":"The appeal is an interlocutory Eleventh Amendment immunity appeal focused entirely on whether Ex parte Young permits the remaining claims and requested remedies to proceed against the Commonwealth-level defendants. The central federal constitutional questions (Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment merits) are not at issue at this stage; the question is jurisdictional and remedial. \n\nOn issue 1, existing Supreme Court precedent treats the continued non-payment or non-return of money or property as the ongoing consequence of prior state action, not as a separate \u2018ongoing violation\u2019 of federal law. Plaintiffs characterize continued withholding as present and ongoing, but that contention is functionally indistinguishable from the argument rejected in Edelman and Papasan. The presence of Rule 60(b) as an existing, individualized remedial mechanism reinforces the conclusion that what plaintiffs seek is to relitigate and overturn past forfeiture judgments on a class-wide basis. That is retrospective in character.\n\nOn issue 2, all remaining requested relief is intertwined with obtaining the return of property previously forfeited and with revisiting historic cases. Notice, accounting, and a new \u2018process\u2019 are not freestanding obligations that would regulate future behavior unrelated to those past forfeitures; they are instruments for facilitating restitution. Green and Edelman mark that as impermissible retrospective relief. The declaratory judgment request is explicitly designed to establish that class members \u2018are entitled to the return\u2019 of forfeited property\u2014precisely the sort of backward-looking liability declaration Green prohibits when it would be used to support subsequent monetary\/property recovery in state fora.\n\nOn issue 3, the specific officials sued lack the type of enforcement authority necessary for Ex parte Young. The design and content of Rule 60(b) procedures, and the way state courts adjudicate those motions, are within the judicial branch\u2019s purview. Executive-branch actors such as the Attorney General, District Attorneys, Trial Court Administrator, and State Police have no power to rewrite those rules or bind the state courts in their conduct of Rule 60(b) proceedings. Without that authority, they are not proper Ex parte Young defendants for the procedural reforms demanded. \n\nTaken together, these points make it highly likely that the appellate court will hold that Ex parte Young does not apply, that the Eleventh Amendment bars all remaining claims against the Commonwealth defendants, and that the district court\u2019s partial denial of the motion to dismiss must be reversed in full, leaving only the already-dismissed claims (and non-appealed local Monell dismissals) as the operative disposition. Hence the overall prediction of complete reversal on appeal."

      },
      "factual_background":"Selim \u201cSam\u201d Zherka was convicted in federal court of a nonviolent financial felony. On December 22, 2015, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to make a false statement to a bank and to sign and file a false federal income tax return, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. His conduct involved defrauding federally insured banks of tens of millions of dollars and causing more than one million dollars in tax loss to the United States. The district court sentenced him to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay approximately $8.5 million in fines, restitution, and forfeiture. As a condition of supervised release, he was prohibited from possessing a firearm. He completed his prison term on May 26, 2017, and his supervised release expired on May 26, 2020. Before his felony conviction, he alleges that he was licensed to carry a firearm in New York, Connecticut, Florida, and Pennsylvania. After the conviction, he alleges he has no recourse to obtain a firearms license and does not currently hold a valid New York firearms license. As a result, the primary legal impediments to his possessing a firearm are the federal felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and New York\u2019s firearms licensing regime (which he does not challenge in this case). Section 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for a person convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to possess any firearm or ammunition in or affecting commerce. Because of this conviction, Zherka is subject to the categorical federal prohibition on firearm possession that applies to felons, even though his offense was nonviolent and financial in nature. He claims that, despite his conviction, he wishes to possess a firearm, at least in his home, for purposes covered by the Second Amendment, such as self-defense.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On September 11, 2020, Zherka filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Attorney General, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. He asserted two principal constitutional claims: (1) a Second Amendment claim that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him and similarly situated individuals convicted only of nonviolent felonies, because, he contends, the Second Amendment does not permit Congress to disarm nonviolent felons; and (2) a Fifth Amendment procedural due process claim, alleging that because he has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in keeping and bearing arms, the federal government must provide some form of individualized process\u2014an assessment or hearing concerning his dangerousness\u2014before permanently depriving him of that right under \u00a7 922(g)(1). As an example of the process he claims is due, he pointed to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c), which by its terms allows a felon to apply to the Attorney General to restore firearm rights upon a showing that possession would not be dangerous to public safety and would not be contrary to the public interest. He sought a declaration that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him and a permanent injunction preventing the government from enforcing \u00a7 922(g)(1) to bar him from possessing a firearm in his home.",
        "district_court_decision":"The government moved to dismiss the complaint. The district court (Judge Philip M. Halpern) granted the motion and dismissed Zherka\u2019s claims. On the Second Amendment claim, the court applied the Second Circuit\u2019s then-governing two-step framework for evaluating firearm regulations. Under that framework, the court first examined whether the challenged law burdened conduct protected by the Second Amendment, in light of text and history, and then, if it did, applied an appropriate level of scrutiny. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s statements in District of Columbia v. Heller that \u201clongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons\u201d are \u201cpresumptively lawful,\u201d the court concluded at step one that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional as applied to individuals convicted of nonviolent financial felonies such as Zherka\u2019s and therefore did not proceed to heightened scrutiny. On the Fifth Amendment due process claim, the court concluded that it was foreclosed by Connecticut Department of Public Safety v. Doe, which held that due process does not require an individualized hearing to determine current dangerousness when a statutory scheme turns solely on the fact of a prior conviction. The district court reasoned that \u00a7 922(g)(1) likewise applies based on the fact of a felony conviction, not on current dangerousness, and thus does not require an individualized hearing. Accordingly, the court rejected both the Second Amendment and due process claims and dismissed the complaint.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Zherka filed a notice of appeal on May 20, 2022, challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal. On appeal, he contests the district court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional as applied to him under the Second Amendment and its rejection of his procedural due process claim. He also asserts that the district court applied an outdated Second Amendment framework in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, and argues that his case should be reconsidered under Bruen\u2019s text-and-history standard. Specifically, he seeks appellate review of: (1) the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1) as applied to nonviolent felons like himself under Bruen; and (2) whether he is constitutionally entitled to individualized process or a mechanism to obtain restoration of firearm rights notwithstanding his felony conviction."

He maintains that the historical tradition of firearm regulation does not support permanently disarming individuals based solely on nonviolent felony convictions, as opposed to demonstrated dangerousness.",
          "He asserts that, under Bruen, once the Second Amendment\u2019s text is found to cover his conduct, the government bears the burden to identify a historical tradition of analogous regulation. In his view, the government cannot meet this burden because there is no adequate historical analogue to a blanket lifetime prohibition on firearm possession for all felons, including those convicted of nonviolent, financial, or regulatory crimes. He argues that early American and English laws focused on disarming those who were dangerous or disloyal, not all offenders regardless of the nature of the crime.",
          "He urges that Bruen and the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Rahimi emphasize dangerousness as the relevant principle justifying disarmament, and that only individuals who have been shown to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of others may be disarmed. He argues that his nonviolent financial crime is an insufficient proxy for dangerousness and that there has been no individualized finding that he is dangerous.

He emphasizes that Congress itself recognized, in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(c), that there should be a mechanism by which felons may seek restoration of firearm rights upon a showing that they are not dangerous to public safety and that relief would not be contrary to the public interest.

Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago, which refer to \u2018longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons\u2019 as \u2018presumptively lawful.\u2019 It also invokes Second Circuit precedent in United States v. Bogle, which upheld \u00a7 922(g)(1) against a facial Second Amendment challenge, as well as other post-Bruen federal appellate decisions that have continued to uphold felon-in-possession prohibitions.",
          "On Bruen\u2019s first step, the government contends that the right to keep and bear arms described by the Supreme Court is a right of \u2018law-abiding, responsible citizens.\u2019 It interprets this language to mean that individuals with felony convictions\u2014by definition not law-abiding\u2014are outside the core class protected by the Second Amendment, or at least may be disarmed consistent with it. It argues that Heller\u2019s description of prohibitions on felon firearm possession as \u2018presumptively lawful\u2019 remains good law after Bruen and Rahimi.",
          "On the Bruen historical-tradition inquiry, the government maintains that there is a well-established tradition of status-based disarmament statutes, beginning in England and the colonies and continuing in the early Republic and beyond. It points to historical laws disarming groups such as Catholics, other religious dissenters, persons disloyal to the revolutionary cause, certain racial groups, Native Americans, and persons labeled as \u2018tramps\u2019 or vagrants, and argues that these provisions show that legislatures historically exercised authority to disarm broad classes of persons deemed dangerous or unreliable, often without individualized dangerousness findings. It analogizes \u00a7 922(g)(1)\u2019s categorical disarmament of felons\u2014individuals who have been convicted of serious violations of the law\u2014to those historical status-based prohibitions.",
          "The government also emphasizes that founding-era punishments for felonies often included death and total forfeiture of property, including nonviolent felonies, and contends that if legislatures could impose such severe penalties on felons, they could, a fortiori, impose the lesser consequence of disarmament. It argues that the Founders had little occasion to consider specific felon-in-possession prohibitions because felons were frequently executed, but that this context supports the permissibility of disarming felons who survive punishment.",
          "Regarding nonviolent felons specifically, the government contends that the historical tradition does not support a constitutional distinction between violent and nonviolent felonies for purposes of firearm disarmament. It argues that felonies, whether violent or nonviolent, reflect serious breaches of the social compact and demonstrate characteristics\u2014such as disregard for law\u2014that legitimately lead Congress to conclude that such individuals should not be trusted with firearms. It maintains that Congress may make categorical judgments without providing individualized hearings to determine dangerousness and that courts are not required (and are ill-suited) to carve out judicial exceptions for nonviolent felons.",
          "On the procedural due process claim, the government argues that Connecticut Department of Public Safety v. Doe is controlling. It asserts that \u00a7 922(g)(1) turns solely on the fact of a prior felony conviction, not on a finding of current dangerousness, and that under Doe, due process does not require an individualized hearing on a fact\u2014such as current dangerousness\u2014that is not material under the statute\u2019s terms. It maintains that any liberty interest Zherka may claim in firearm possession is fully defined and limited by the lawful scope of the Second Amendment as interpreted under Bruen and related cases; because the statute applies categorically to all felons based on their convictions, there is no constitutional requirement for individualized reassessment. The government further notes that Congress created certain exceptions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) for individuals whose convictions have been expunged, set aside, or pardoned, or whose civil rights have been restored, and that these mechanisms, not a freestanding due process requirement for dangerousness hearings, are the means Congress chose for relief from the disability. It contends that Congress\u2019s longstanding decision to defund the \u00a7 925(c) restoration program is a legislative policy choice that does not give rise to a constitutional violation."

Post\u2011Bruen, every circuit to consider \u00a7 922(g)(1) has either upheld it facially or, at minimum, declined to invalidate it as applied to nonviolent felons. The Second Circuit is bound by Heller and McDonald\u2019s description of felon\u2011in\u2011possession prohibitions as \u201cpresumptively lawful,\u201d and by its own precedent (e.g., Bogle) that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a valid restriction on felons\u2019 Second Amendment rights. Bruen and Rahimi did not overrule those pronouncements or call felon disarmament into direct question; Rahimi explicitly reaffirmed that \u2018nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt\u2019 on such longstanding prohibitions. Under Bruen\u2019s text\u2011and\u2011history test, the court can either (1) hold that felons are outside the core class of \u201claw\u2011abiding, responsible citizens\u201d whose rights are protected, or (2) assume the text covers the conduct and find sufficient historical analogues in status\u2011based disarmament and the severe sanctions traditionally imposed on felons. Either route supports constitutionality as applied even to nonviolent financial felonies.

Historical practice includes broad status\u2011based disarmament of groups deemed unreliable or outside the class of \u2018law\u2011abiding, responsible\u2019 citizens, often without individualized dangerousness findings. Nothing in Bruen or Rahimi suggests that Congress must finely calibrate disarmament solely to those convicted of violent offenses or must supply a dangerousness\u2011screening mechanism as a constitutional matter. To the contrary, the Court has repeatedly used \u2018law\u2011abiding, responsible citizens\u2019 to describe the protected core, and has left intact Heller\u2019s statement that felon prohibitions are \u2018presumptively lawful.\u2019 The government\u2019s analogues (status\u2011based disarmament, harsh historical penalties for felonies, and the broad legislative authority to draw categorical lines) comfortably support a uniform felony\u2011based rule. Courts of appeals post\u2011Bruen have overwhelmingly rejected attempts to constitutionalize a violent\/nonviolent distinction for \u00a7 922(g)(1); the Second Circuit is very unlikely to be the first to hold that Congress must provide special exceptions for nonviolent felons.

Doe directly controls: when a statutory disability turns solely on the fact of a prior conviction, due process does not entitle the affected person to an individualized hearing on current dangerousness because that fact is legally irrelevant under the statute. Section 922(g)(1) applies categorically to anyone with a qualifying felony conviction, without making dangerousness an element or criterion; the only operative fact is the conviction itself. Under Doe, the Constitution does not require a hearing on a factor the statute does not make material. Zherka\u2019s attempt to invoke Bruen to make dangerousness \u2018material\u2019 for due process purposes fails because Bruen is a substantive Second Amendment decision, not a procedural due process case; once the court concludes under Bruen that Congress may constitutionally disarm felons as a class, the scope of any liberty interest in firearms is correspondingly limited. There is no freestanding constitutional right to a restoration mechanism or to implementation of \u00a7 925(c); Congress\u2019s decision to defund that program is a policy choice, not a due process violation.

On procedural due process, Connecticut v. Doe squarely holds that no hearing is required where the statutory scheme turns only on the fact of conviction, which is exactly how \u00a7 922(g)(1) operates.

      "factual_background":"David Keane worked for Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (Expeditors US) at its facility in Peabody, Massachusetts, from 1998 to 2018. In 2016, an officer of Expeditors US, whom Keane alleges was acting on behalf of Expeditors Hong Kong Limited (Expeditors HK), approached him about transferring his employment to Hong Kong. According to Keane\u2019s complaint, during negotiations he and Expeditors US reached a mutual oral agreement that the move to Hong Kong would be temporary and that his employment status would remain with Expeditors US.\n\nIn 2018, Keane entered into a written employment agreement relating to his relocation to Hong Kong. That agreement stated that his employment would be with the Expeditors US North Asia Regional Office and was signed 'for and on behalf of Expeditors [US].' Keane moved to Hong Kong and began working there in September 2018 pursuant to this agreement. The appellees, however, contend that the 2018 agreement effectively switched Keane\u2019s employment to Expeditors HK; the opinion notes this is disputed, and for purposes of the jurisdictional analysis Keane\u2019s version is credited.\n\nOn September 25, 2023, Keane entered into a new employment contract under which he continued to work in Hong Kong at the offices of Expeditors HK. This 2023 agreement undisputedly designated Expeditors HK as his employer. An affidavit from Kaiser Lam, Regional Vice President of Expeditors HK, asserted that Expeditors HK is organized under the laws of Hong Kong, is not incorporated in Massachusetts, does not maintain its principal place of business in Massachusetts, is not registered to do business in Massachusetts, has no office, property, or employees in Massachusetts, and has sued and been sued in Hong Kong courts. Lam further stated that after Keane\u2019s relocation in 2018, Expeditors HK maintained and administered Keane\u2019s employment records in Hong Kong; that Expeditors HK maintains its own ledgers and accounting books; prepares its own business plans, payroll, budget, and financial statements; administers and controls its own health plan and related benefits; and controls decisions regarding hiring and firing of its employees.\n\nKeane\u2019s complaint alleges that he was informed that a coworker had made a sexual harassment allegation concerning his conduct toward her at a September 21, 2023 event in Hong Kong hosted by Expeditors HK. Expeditors HK undertook an investigation into the allegation, interviewing Keane and other individuals in or around Hong Kong, and subjected him to a disciplinary proceeding. On December 11, 2023, Expeditors HK terminated Keane\u2019s employment by letter, stating that the sexual harassment allegation had been substantiated, that his actions were a serious violation of Expeditors\u2019 Code of Business Conduct, and that this was the second allegation of sexual harassment made against him.\n\nKeane alleges that the only prior sexual harassment claim involving him dates back to 2014\u20132015, when he was located in Massachusetts and employed by Expeditors US. He also alleges, without providing supporting factual detail, that the CEO of Expeditors US had secretly developed a plan to reduce the company\u2019s workforce by 2,000 employees and personally sanctioned the termination of Keane\u2019s employment. His complaint further alleges that Expeditors HK shares common management with Expeditors US and that Expeditors US exercises direct and substantial control over Expeditors HK\u2019s business activities. He asserts that Expeditors HK is required to implement and follow Expeditors US\u2019s Code of Business Conduct, personnel policies, and business directives.",

His complaint asserted six counts: (1) breach of the 2018 oral and written contracts against Expeditors US; (2) breach of the 2023 employment contract against Expeditors HK; and (3) discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, (4) tortious interference with business relations, and (5) negligent infliction of emotional distress, all asserted against both Expeditors US and Expeditors HK. All claims arose out of, or were connected to, the termination of his employment in Hong Kong.\n\nThe defendants moved to dismiss all of Keane\u2019s claims against both Expeditors HK and Expeditors US for lack of personal jurisdiction and under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. They also moved to dismiss the federal law claim (the Title VII claim) against both defendants for improper venue. Defendants argued, among other points, that the district court should reject Keane\u2019s attempt to establish jurisdiction over Expeditors HK based on conclusory alter-ego assertions that Expeditors HK was an alter ego of Expeditors US. Both parties submitted supporting affidavits on the jurisdictional issues.\n\nThe district court ruled on the motion to dismiss under the prima facie standard for personal jurisdiction. It dismissed all claims against Expeditors HK for lack of personal jurisdiction. It also dismissed the non-contract claims against Expeditors US for lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court dismissed the contract-based claims against Expeditors US under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. In doing so, the district court rejected Keane\u2019s argument that Expeditors HK was subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts as the alter ego of Expeditors US, explaining that Keane had offered no evidence beyond overlapping leadership to rebut the evidence that Expeditors US and Expeditors HK maintained corporate formalities as distinct entities.",

In the course of the appeal, it is acknowledged that all of Keane\u2019s claims, including those against Expeditors US, are premised on his allegation that he was unlawfully terminated by Expeditors HK and that his ability to prevail depends on establishing that the termination by Expeditors HK was wrongful and that Expeditors HK\u2019s actions can be attributed to Expeditors US."

Under due process and Massachusetts (or analogous First Circuit) precedent, overlapping officers\/directors, adherence to a parent\u2019s global policies, and ordinary parent\u2013subsidiary coordination are insufficient to establish that the foreign subsidiary\u2019s in\u2011forum contacts can be imputed to it or to create specific jurisdiction.

Under Massachusetts veil\u2011piercing and alter\u2011ego law, the corporate form may be disregarded only upon a strong showing that the parent directed and controlled the subsidiary and used it for an improper purpose, considering factors like undercapitalization, nonobservance of corporate formalities, and pervasive control. Common management alone is routinely held inadequate. Here, Keane points to: (a) overlapping high\u2011level leadership (the CEO and a Senior Vice President of Expeditors US also serving as directors of Expeditors HK) and (b) Expeditors HK\u2019s obligation to implement Expeditors US\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and policies. He supplies no nonconclusory facts of thin capitalization, failure to maintain separate books, mingling of funds, disregard of corporate formalities, or use of the subsidiary as a mere shell. The Lam affidavit affirmatively shows separate books, records, payroll, benefits, and decision\u2011making by Expeditors HK. Keane\u2019s allegation that the Expeditors US CEO planned a workforce reduction and \u2018personally sanctioned\u2019 his termination is entirely unsupported by specific facts connecting that plan to the Hong Kong investigation or decision beyond speculation, and is therefore treated as conclusory under the prima facie standard. On this record, Massachusetts law does not permit piercing the veil or treating Expeditors HK as the alter ego of Expeditors US. For employment\u2011status purposes (e.g., under Title VII), Keane likewise fails to allege that Expeditors US controlled the manner and means of his work in Hong Kong after 2018\/2023; the undisputed 2023 contract identifies Expeditors HK as his employer, and the day\u2011to\u2011day supervision, investigation, and termination were conducted by Expeditors HK in Hong Kong. Because all of Keane\u2019s substantive claims against Expeditors US depend on attributing Expeditors HK\u2019s termination decision to Expeditors US, the lack of a legally cognizable basis to impute those acts is dispositive. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Keane failed to establish an adequate alter\u2011ego or control theory is affirmed."

Given the appellate court\u2019s agreement that Expeditors HK is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts and that its actions cannot be imputed to Expeditors US under veil\u2011piercing or similar theories, Keane cannot state viable contract claims in Massachusetts that depend on the alleged wrongfulness of Expeditors HK\u2019s termination. That allows the court to affirm the dismissal of the contract claims without needing to reach (or to second\u2011guess in detail) the forum non conveniens balancing; at most, it might treat the forum non conveniens discussion as alternative reasoning. Even if the panel briefly reviews the forum non conveniens ruling, the relevant private and public interest factors\u2014locus of operative facts (Hong Kong), location of witnesses and evidence (Hong Kong), and local interest in a Hong Kong employment dispute\u2014strongly favor Hong Kong, which is an adequate alternative forum where Expeditors HK has been sued before.

Keane\u2019s Title VII claim is based on the investigation and termination in Hong Kong following the September 2023 incident at a Hong Kong event. The alleged unlawful employment practices (investigation, discipline, and discharge) occurred in Hong Kong, and the Lam affidavit states that the employment records concerning these practices are maintained and administered in Hong Kong. Keane worked, and would have continued to work but for his termination, in Hong Kong. None of the first three statutory venue bases points to Massachusetts. As to the fourth fallback basis (respondent\u2019s principal office), even if Expeditors US\u2019s principal office is in Washington State, that does not make Massachusetts a proper venue. Nor, given the failure of his alter\u2011ego theory, can Keane bootstrap venue through a theory that Expeditors HK should be treated as if present in Massachusetts.

All of Keane\u2019s claims ultimately depend on treating Expeditors HK\u2019s Hong Kong\u2011based termination decision as wrongful and then attributing that decision to Expeditors US or otherwise using it to anchor jurisdiction and venue in Massachusetts. The record on personal jurisdiction and corporate separateness is strongly one\u2011sided: Expeditors HK is a classic foreign subsidiary with no Massachusetts presence, its actions occurred abroad, and it keeps its own books and makes its own employment decisions. Keane\u2019s contrary assertions are largely conclusory (e.g., workforce\u2011reduction plot, personal involvement of the U.S. CEO) and lack concrete factual support. Under the prima facie standard, such conclusory allegations are disregarded. Overlapping directors and adherence to the parent\u2019s policies do not meet the high threshold for disregarding the corporate form or imputing contacts. Consequently, (1) there is no specific personal jurisdiction over Expeditors HK, (2) there is no adequate legal basis to impute Expeditors HK\u2019s termination decision to Expeditors US or to treat Expeditors US as Keane\u2019s employer in Hong Kong, (3) the contract claims against Expeditors US, which presuppose a wrongful termination by Expeditors HK, necessarily fail or, alternatively, are properly dismissed in favor of a Hong Kong forum, and (4) venue in Massachusetts for the Title VII claim is improper because all relevant practices and records are centered in Hong Kong and there is no statutory hook to Massachusetts. Given controlling precedents on personal jurisdiction, veil\u2011piercing, and Title VII venue, the district court\u2019s dismissals fall squarely within accepted bounds, so the appellate court is likely to affirm on all issues."

      "factual_background":"Annette McEachin worked as a human resources manager at Perceptron, Inc. In February 2017, approximately two years into that employment, she was seriously injured in a car accident. She left her job and, within months, submitted a long-term disability claim to Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company, citing recurrent headaches and neck and back pain resulting from the car accident. In June 2017, Reliance approved her for long-term disability benefits.\n\nAt the end of 2017, McEachin was involved in another car accident, which worsened her condition. As a result of the two accidents, she underwent three major spinal surgeries between 2018 and 2021, attended numerous physical therapy sessions, received injections for migraines, and took prescription pain medications. During this period, her mental health also deteriorated. She was treated for depression, anxiety, and sleep disruptions. In 2019, her son committed suicide, which led to post-traumatic stress disorder and grief, further affecting her mental health.\n\nUnder McEachin\u2019s group long-term disability insurance policy issued by Reliance, an insured is entitled to monthly benefits for \"Total Disability\" until retirement age. The policy defines \"Total Disability\" as a condition in which, as a result of injury or sickness, the insured cannot perform the material duties of her regular occupation during the elimination period and thereafter. To receive benefits, the claimant must be totally disabled due to a covered sickness or injury, be under the regular care of a physician, complete the elimination period, and submit satisfactory proof of total disability.\n\nThe policy also contains a limitation for \"mental or nervous disorders.\" It provides that monthly benefits for total disability \"caused by or contributed to\" by mental or nervous disorders are not payable beyond an aggregate lifetime maximum of 24 months, unless the insured is confined in a hospital or institution at the end of that period, in which case benefits continue while so confined (subject to the overall maximum duration of benefits).\n\nFor over three years, Reliance paid McEachin long-term disability benefits. During that time, she periodically submitted updated medical information as required by the policy. In October 2020, Reliance terminated her benefits. McEachin administratively appealed and submitted additional medical documentation. Based on the updated medical records, Reliance concluded that, from a physical perspective, McEachin remained unable to perform the material duties of her job, but that there were no cognizable mental-health barriers to her working. Reliance reinstated her long-term disability benefits.\n\nIn April 2021, Reliance again stopped paying McEachin\u2019s benefits. McEachin appealed this second termination and submitted documentation from her medical providers indicating that she continued to suffer from depression, migraines, and chronic pain and remained totally disabled. Reliance obtained an independent medical review, which concluded that, from a physical standpoint, McEachin could perform her prior job. Reliance cited medical evidence showing significant improvement in her migraines, significant relief of chronic back and leg pain with physical therapy and injections, and improvement in strength and function.\n\nReliance acknowledged that McEachin\u2019s psychiatric conditions still rendered her unable to work full time. It determined, however, that any continuing entitlement to benefits was limited by the policy\u2019s 24\u2011month cap applicable to total disability \"caused by or contributed to\" by mental or nervous disorders. Reliance noted that McEachin had exhibited psychiatric symptoms since at least May 2017 and concluded that the 24\u2011month mental-health limitation period had already expired. Because Reliance determined that her physical impairments alone no longer rendered her totally disabled, it terminated her benefits on the ground that she was not entitled to additional payments once the 24\u2011month mental-health period had run.\n\nMedical records around April 2021 indicated that the frequency and severity of McEachin\u2019s migraines had declined, that physical therapy had helped her regain full strength in her extremities, and that MRI and x\u2011ray imaging showed positive results. After her second surgery, she reported feeling \"so much better\" and could walk without a limp. A file reviewer opined that, as of April 2021, McEachin had the capacity to work on a full-time, consistent basis with certain restrictions and limitations, such as avoiding walking and standing more than two hours in an eight-hour workday, and concluded she would not be precluded from performing her own occupation. The record also reflected that, by that time, she had resumed some physical activities, including a rafting trip several months earlier.\n\nMcEachin had a further spinal surgery scheduled for October 2021. Records noted that this surgery was not emergent and that functioning at a sedentary level would not increase her risk of further injury prior to the surgery. Later medical evidence, including an August report from her orthopedic surgeon, addressed her condition after April 2021. On appeal, she sought to rely on some of this later evidence both to contest her physical capacity as of April 1, 2021, and to argue that any period of renewed physical disability during the 24\u2011month mental-health window should affect how the policy\u2019s 24\u2011month limitation was applied.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"After Reliance terminated her long-term disability benefits in April 2021 and denied her internal appeal, and after she exhausted her administrative remedies, Annette McEachin filed an ERISA civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company. She challenged Reliance\u2019s termination of her long-term disability benefits, contending that she remained totally disabled under the terms of the policy due to both physical and mental conditions. The case proceeded under ERISA\u2019s framework for review of benefit denials under an employee welfare benefit plan.",
        "district_court_decision":"Both parties moved for summary judgment. A magistrate judge recommended denying McEachin\u2019s motion and granting Reliance\u2019s motion in full. The district court agreed with Reliance that, as of April 2021, McEachin\u2019s physical conditions no longer rendered her totally disabled under the policy\u2019s definition of total disability. However, the district court also determined that McEachin\u2019s ongoing mental-health conditions constituted a separate basis for total disability and that, under the policy\u2019s mental-disorder limitation provision, she was entitled to an additional 24 months of benefits starting in April 2021, despite Reliance\u2019s position that the 24\u2011month period had already expired based on earlier mental-health symptoms.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Reliance appealed the district court\u2019s ruling that, notwithstanding its finding that McEachin was not totally disabled due to physical conditions as of April 2021, her mental-health conditions entitled her to 24 months of additional benefits beginning April 2021. McEachin cross\u2011appealed the district court\u2019s determination that her physical impairments did not render her totally disabled as of April 1, 2021, and further argued that physical disability arising or documented during the ensuing 24\u2011month mental-health period should toll or interrupt the running of the 24\u2011month mental-health limitation and potentially extend her eligibility for benefits beyond April 2023."

          "legal_standard":"Interpretation of an ERISA-governed insurance policy is governed by federal common law of ERISA and applicable state insurance law. Where a plan purports to grant discretionary authority to the administrator, abuse-of-discretion review can apply, but in Michigan, administrative rules (Mich. Admin. Code R. 500.2202(b)) bar the use of discretionary clauses in insurance policies. Therefore, courts in such cases review the administrator\u2019s benefit determination de novo. Under prior Sixth Circuit precedent, such as Okuno v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co., for policies containing a mental-health limitation for disabilities \"caused by or contributed to\" by mental or nervous disorders, the limitation applies only if, but for the claimant\u2019s mental-health condition, she would not be totally disabled\u2014that is, her physical impairments alone must be insufficient to establish total disability before the mental-health limitation is triggered.

However, the policy language here provides that benefits are owed for as long as the insured remains totally disabled, and separate periods of disability may be recognized if supported by the record. The question on this issue centers on how to apply the policy\u2019s 24\u2011month mental-health limitation where the claimant remains continuously totally disabled, but the relative contribution of mental and physical conditions to that total disability may change over time, and whether periods of renewed physical total disability within the 24\u2011month mental-health window suspend or toll the running of that limitation."

          "Reliance argues that the policy\u2019s mental-health limitation applies whenever a mental or nervous disorder either causes or contributes to the insured\u2019s total disability. It contends that the ordinary meaning of \"cause\" and \"contribute\" requires giving independent effect to each term; thus, even if McEachin\u2019s physical conditions initially justified benefits, her concurrent mental-health conditions also contributed to her disability from the beginning, such that the 24\u2011month limitation period began running at least as early as 2017 when she first exhibited and received treatment for mental-health symptoms.",
          "Reliance maintains that the district court misapplied Sixth Circuit precedent, particularly Okuno v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co., by effectively resetting the 24\u2011month mental-health limitation period in April 2021. In its view, Okuno involved a scenario where physical impairments were themselves independently disabling throughout the relevant period, whereas in McEachin\u2019s case her physical impairments had improved to the point of not being independently disabling by April 2021, so the mental-health limitation should have been deemed to have already run based on the earlier combined disability.",
          "Reliance asserts that the record as of April 2021 shows significant improvement in McEachin\u2019s physical condition, including reduced migraines, improved strength and function, favorable imaging, and activities inconsistent with total physical disability (such as rafting). Its independent medical reviewer concluded that she could work full time in her own occupation at a sedentary level with restrictions, and Reliance argues that this evidence supports its determination that her ongoing total disability, if any, was due solely to mental-health conditions subject to the 24\u2011month cap.",
          "Reliance relies in part on the Social Security Administration\u2019s disability determination, which identified depression and anxiety as components of McEachin\u2019s disability, to support its position that her mental-health conditions contributed to her overall disability from an early point and to argue that her claim properly falls under the policy\u2019s mental-health limitation.",
          "Reliance cites prior case law, including the unpublished Eastin v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance decision, to support its interpretation that where mental and physical impairments combine to produce total disability from the outset, the mental-health limitation applies even if physical impairments are also present, and that the presence of mental-health factors is sufficient to trigger the 24\u2011month limitation under the \"caused by or contributed to\" language."
        ],
        "appellee_arguments":[
          "McEachin argues that under the policy language and Sixth Circuit precedent, including Okuno, the mental-health limitation does not apply so long as her physical impairments alone are sufficient to render her totally disabled. She maintains that from the onset of her disability in 2017 until at least April 2021, her physical injuries and resulting pain, surgeries, and functional limitations independently met the policy\u2019s definition of total disability, and that the mere presence of mental-health conditions during that time could not properly start the 24\u2011month mental-health clock.",
          "She contends that Reliance\u2019s own conduct supports this view: when Reliance reinstated her benefits in October 2020 after a prior termination, it expressly stated that she could not perform her job \"from a physical perspective\" and that, from a mental-health perspective, there were no cognizable work barriers, indicating that Reliance itself treated the disability during that period as physically based.",
          "On her cross-appeal, McEachin argues that the district court erred in finding that her physical impairments were not independently disabling as of April 1, 2021. She points to ongoing pain, the need for additional surgery, and subsequent medical evidence, including statements from her orthopedic surgeon and other providers, which she contends demonstrate that her spinal issues, migraines, and related symptoms continued to preclude full-time work in her own occupation even at a sedentary level.",
          "She further argues that, even if she was not totally disabled by physical impairments on April 1, 2021, the policy\u2019s structure and the continuous nature of her disability permit her to rely on later evidence to show that at certain times between April 2021 and April 2023, her physical condition again independently rendered her totally disabled. In her view, during any such periods, the 24\u2011month mental-health limitation should be tolled or suspended because the total disability would then rest on physical, not mental, impairments.",
          "McEachin also takes the position that, as a matter of policy interpretation and fairness under ERISA, an insurer should not be allowed to run the mental-health limitation continuously once mental-health symptoms appear, regardless of the evolving relative contributions of physical and mental conditions, where the policy promises ongoing benefits for total disability and does not expressly preclude the possibility of shifting bases of disability (from physical to mental and back) over time."

          "prediction":"REVERSE",
          "reasoning":"The question is purely one of plan interpretation under ERISA, reviewed de novo because Michigan\u2019s ban on discretionary clauses disables deferential review. The policy pays for total disability, but limits to 24 months any total disability \u201ccaused by or contributed to\u201d by a mental or nervous disorder. Under Okuno and similar Sixth Circuit authority, the limitation applies only if, absent the mental disorder, the claimant would not be totally disabled\u2014i.e., where mental impairment is a but\u2011for cause of total disability. Here, the district court treated April 1, 2021 as the start of a new, separate 24\u2011month mental\u2011disorder period, even though it also held that as of that same date McEachin\u2019s physical impairments no longer independently rendered her disabled. That combination of findings necessarily means that, as of April 1, any continuing total disability was at least in part dependent on mental\u2011health conditions; under Okuno, that is exactly when the limitation is triggered. The undisputed record also shows that mental\u2011health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD) had been present and contributing to her overall condition years earlier. Once the court concluded that physical impairments alone were not totally disabling on April 1, 2021, it could not restart or reset a fresh 24\u2011month mental\u2011health period at that date. Rather, Reliance met its burden to show that the mental\u2011health limitation had already been running from the earlier period when mental and physical conditions combined to produce disability, and that the 24 months had expired by April 2021. The district court\u2019s grant of an additional 24 months from April 2021 misapplied Okuno\u2019s but\u2011for framework and the \u201ccaused by or contributed to\u201d language. Accordingly, the appellate court is likely to reverse the award of an extra 24\u2011month mental\u2011health period beginning April 2021 and hold that Reliance did not owe further benefits on that basis."

        "issue_3":{
          "standard_of_review":"de novo",
          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"The tolling question is also one of contract interpretation under ERISA and is reviewed de novo. McEachin seeks to use post\u2013April 1, 2021 medical evidence to argue that (a) she later again became physically totally disabled within the 24\u2011month mental\u2011health window, and (b) any such period should suspend or restart the running of the 24\u2011month mental\u2011health limitation. Sixth Circuit ERISA precedent allows later evidence only insofar as it illuminates the claimant\u2019s condition at the time of the challenged denial; it cannot create a new disability period for that denial. More importantly, there is nothing in the policy text providing that the 24\u2011month cap for disabilities \u201ccaused by or contributed to\u201d by mental or nervous disorders is tolled, interrupted, or reset if at some later point physical conditions become independently disabling. The limitation is an aggregate lifetime maximum tied to the nature of the disability (i.e., involving mental or nervous disorders), not a series of restartable segments. So long as the claimant\u2019s total disability during those months is caused or contributed to by a mental or nervous disorder, those months count against the 24\u2011month cap, regardless of whether physical impairments also exist or later become independently disabling. Allowing tolling whenever physical symptoms wax and wane would effectively nullify the limitation, contrary to its plain language. Applying standard ERISA principles, the appellate court is likely to hold that later\u2011arising or later\u2011documented physical disability within the 24\u2011month period neither retroactively alters the basis of disability found at the time of the April 2021 termination nor pauses the running of the mental\u2011health cap. The district court\u2019s rejection of a tolling or interruption theory is therefore likely to be affirmed."

      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",
      "confidence":0.77,
      "reasoning":"On de novo review, two pivotal holdings of the district court move in different directions. First, the court\u2019s factual and legal conclusion that, as of April 1, 2021, McEachin\u2019s physical condition no longer rendered her totally disabled is supported by the contemporaneous medical evidence: reduced migraine frequency and severity, improved strength and function, favorable imaging, the ability to walk without a limp, participation in activities such as rafting, and an independent medical opinion supporting full\u2011time sedentary work with restrictions. Under Okuno, once physical impairments are not independently disabling, any continuing total disability is at least in part dependent on mental\u2011health conditions. Given the longstanding presence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, Reliance met its burden to show that the mental\u2011health limitation applied and that the 24\u2011month period had already been exhausted by April 2021. The district court\u2019s decision to \u2018restart\u2019 a fresh 24\u2011month period from April 2021 conflicts with the but\u2011for framework in Okuno and the aggregate\u2011limit nature of the policy\u2019s mental\u2011disorder cap. The appellate court is thus likely to reverse the ruling granting an additional 24 months of mental\u2011health\u2011based benefits from April 2021.\n\nOn the cross\u2011appeal issue regarding tolling the mental\u2011health limitation with later physical disability, the policy\u2019s language and Sixth Circuit ERISA doctrine favor Reliance. The 24\u2011month cap is framed as a lifetime aggregate maximum for total disability \u201ccaused by or contributed to\u201d by mental or nervous disorders; it does not contain any textual hook for tolling, interruption, or multiple separate mental\u2011health periods. Sixth Circuit cases caution against using post\u2011denial evidence to create new disability periods for the challenged denial. Even if McEachin\u2019s physical condition worsened again during the 24\u2011month mental\u2011health window, that would not toll or reset the 24\u2011month aggregate cap for months where mental conditions continued to contribute to her disability. The district court\u2019s rejection of McEachin\u2019s tolling theory is consistent with these principles and is likely to be affirmed. The result is a mixed outcome: Reliance prevails in overturning the extra 24\u2011month mental\u2011health award, while the district court\u2019s rejection of McEachin\u2019s tolling\/extension theory is sustained."

Certain Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) individuals were also named as defendants below and are implicated in the appeal."
      },
      "factual_background":"From approximately 1990 to 1999, Patrick Rose, Sr., a Boston Police Department (BPD) officer, sexually abused two children, John and Jane Doe, who lived with him. Rose was married to their mother, Frances Rose, and the abuse occurred while he was employed as a BPD officer. John Doe was abused from about 1990 through 1997, when he was between eight and fourteen years old. Jane Doe was abused from about 1990 through 1999, when she was between five and fourteen years old. Rose also allegedly sexually abused four other child family members from at least 1990 through 2020.\n\nOn November 8, 1995, the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) received a report that Rose had sexually abused John Doe and accepted it for investigation that same day. Later that week, BPD began its own criminal investigation. Lieutenant Marie Donahue and Sergeant Detective John McLean of BPD\u2019s Sexual Assault Unit were assigned. On November 10, 1995, they interviewed John Doe in a police car outside Rose\u2019s home while Rose and Frances stood outside and watched. During this interview, John reported that Rose had sexually abused him. BPD then arrested Rose for Indecent Assault and Battery on a Child Under 14 and prepared an internal incident report. That same day, Rose was served with a restraining order barring him from contact with John, Jane, another child victim in the family, and a fourth minor, and he was placed on administrative duty. On November 11, BPD confiscated his weapons and license to carry a firearm. A few days later, two of John\u2019s minor friends confirmed to Sgt. Det. McLean that Rose had forced John to touch him inappropriately multiple times.\n\nBetween November 13 and 16, 1995, DCF employees conducted their investigation. Lt. Donahue instructed DCF not to visit the Rose home because the allegation involved a Boston police officer, saying she would visit instead to avoid potential harm given that Rose was armed and might react violently. Contrary to investigative protocols, she also instructed DCF not to reinterview John. DCF followed this directive, interviewing Jane\u2014but not John\u2014in the presence of Frances. On November 16, 1995, DCF concluded that evidence supported the allegation that Rose sexually abused John and referred the case to the district attorney.\n\nIn late November 1995, Sgt. Det. McLean filed a criminal complaint in state court charging Rose with Indecent Assault and Battery on a Child Under 14. On December 1, 1995, Rose was arraigned, represented by an attorney associated with the Boston Police Patrolman\u2019s Association (BPPA). The court imposed one year of pretrial probation, until December 1, 1996, and ordered Rose to attend therapy as directed by DCF.\n\nRose did not comply with the court-ordered therapy or the restraining order. According to the complaint, none of the defendants took action in response to those violations. In January 1996, DCF consented to the withdrawal of the restraining order, about two months after it had been entered. In February 1996, Anne Marie Doherty, BPD Superintendent\u2011in\u2011Chief of the Office of Internal Investigations, and LaDonna Hatton, BPD Legal Advisor, approved vacating the restraining order. On May 7, 1996, the Commonwealth dismissed the criminal complaint seven months before Rose\u2019s pretrial probation period was scheduled to end, asserting that Rose had met his pretrial requirements and that the victims were no longer willing to cooperate.\n\nInternally, BPD initiated an administrative investigation. In December 1995, Sergeant Detective Eileen Vanderwood of BPD Internal Affairs Division (IAD) prepared an internal complaint based on the criminal charge. In April 1996, IAD ordered Rose to report for an interview, which took place in early June 1996. Rose invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to provide information. Shortly thereafter, IAD sustained the complaint against him, finding that he violated a BPD rule prohibiting employees from committing criminal acts\u2014a rule that allowed discipline up to and including discharge. No further investigation, disciplinary measures, or final disposition followed this sustained finding.\n\nIn May 1997, after Rose had been on administrative duty for over a year, his BPPA attorney requested that he be reinstated to full duty and submitted affidavits from John and Frances recanting John\u2019s 1995 abuse allegations. In October 1997, the attorney filed a grievance with the City of Boston\u2019s Office of Labor Relations (OLR), claiming BPD lacked just cause to keep Rose on administrative duty. OLR denied the grievance. Despite IAD\u2019s sustained finding and OLR\u2019s conclusion that administrative duty was appropriate, BPD Commissioner Paul Evans reinstated Rose to full duty in May 1998 without sanction. Rose then continued to serve as a police officer until his 2018 retirement and was elected president of the BPPA from 2014 to 2018.\n\nAccording to the Does\u2019 allegations, following John\u2019s 1995 report, Rose continued to sexually abuse John, Jane, and the four other child victims. John\u2019s abuse continued through 1997; Jane\u2019s through 1999. In 2020, when John was in his late thirties, he again reported Rose\u2019s abuse\u2014including abuse of four other victims\u2014to BPD. A Massachusetts grand jury indicted Rose on 33 counts of sexual abuse. In April 2022, Rose pled guilty to 21 counts of child rape and sexual assault and was sentenced to prison. At sentencing, John testified that Rose\u2019s abuse escalated after November 1995 because the City did nothing in response to his report.",

Counts 11\u201315 asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 against Rose, Frances, the BPD defendants, the DCF defendants, the City, the BPPA, and individual BPPA defendants, alleging that defendants conspired to deprive the Does of their civil rights, including by intimidating them and obstructing justice. The remaining 28 counts asserted various state statutory and common-law claims. Most defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

As to the \u00a7 1983 Fourteenth Amendment bodily integrity claims, the court concluded that the BPD and DCF defendants could not be held liable under the state\u2011created danger doctrine because, in the court\u2019s view, the plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged that any defendant\u2019s affirmative conduct created or enhanced the danger posed by Rose or caused the plaintiffs\u2019 harm. It also dismissed the remaining \u00a7 1983 claims, including those against the City, holding that the plaintiffs had not plausibly alleged any underlying constitutional violation by a City employee and therefore could not satisfy the requirements for municipal liability under Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York. The court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claims against Rose and Frances as well, and it rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they had asserted separate Fourteenth Amendment court\u2011access due process claims, finding only bodily\u2011integrity\u2011based due process claims in the pleading.\n\nRegarding the \u00a7 1985 conspiracy claims, the court treated the complaint as invoking \u00a7 1985(2) (obstruction of justice by intimidating a party or witness) and \u00a7 1985(3) (deprivation of equal protection by class\u2011based conspiracy). It ruled that the plaintiffs had not adequately alleged the requisite class-based discriminatory animus or membership in a protected class, nor a plausible conspiracy, and also noted the absence of a sufficiently pleaded underlying constitutional violation. The court dismissed the \u00a7 1985 claims against all defendants, including the BPPA. Because all federal claims were dismissed, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the 28 state-law counts.\n\nAs to the DCF individual defendants, who had not moved to dismiss, the district court dismissed all claims against them sua sponte on the same reasoning applied to the moving defendants.",

          "reasoning":"At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the court accepts the horrific abuse as true but must still find a plausible Fourteenth Amendment violation attributable to affirmative state action that created or enhanced a specific danger. Under DeShaney and the First Circuit\u2019s state\u2011created danger cases (e.g., Irish v. Fowler), merely failing to protect, conduct amounting only to negligence, or routine investigative choices\u2014even if badly executed\u2014do not suffice. Here, most of the challenged conduct by BPD and DCF officials is either (a) protective or neutral in form (arresting Rose, seizing his weapons, initiating DCF and IAD investigations, obtaining a restraining order), or (b) nonfeasance (not enforcing therapy requirements, not pursuing discipline after a sustained IAD finding, acceding to the restraining order\u2019s withdrawal, allowing reinstatement). The two principal alleged \u2018affirmative acts\u2019\u2014interviewing John in the car within view of Rose and Frances, and directing DCF not to re\u2011interview John or visit the home\u2014are plausibly poor practice, but the complaint does not plausibly allege that they increased the danger beyond that posed by Rose himself or that they caused specific incremental episodes of abuse, as opposed to failing to reduce an existing, privately created danger. First Circuit precedent has been cautious in extending state\u2011created danger to child\u2011abuse contexts, and requires a clear affirmative enhancement of risk and conscience\u2011shocking deliberate indifference when officials have time to deliberate. On these facts, a panel is likely to agree with the district court that the complaint, while morally compelling, does not cross the constitutional line into a viable state\u2011created danger claim against the BPD or DCF defendants and that causation and the requisite culpability are not plausibly alleged. The dismissal on this issue is therefore likely to be affirmed."

Even if one were to assume, arguendo, that a constitutional violation had been plausibly alleged, the complaint\u2019s Monell allegations are thin: they essentially describe a sequence of decisions in a single officer\u2019s case (investigation, internal affairs outcome, restraining order withdrawal, reinstatement) and generalize them into a \u2018custom of mishandling complaints.\u2019 First Circuit law generally requires more than one individual series of events to show a widespread custom or practice, particularly at the level of specificity needed to causally link a policy of mishandling citizen complaints to this particular constitutional injury.

      "reasoning":"The most difficult and emotionally charged question is whether the pleaded facts about BPD\u2019s and DCF\u2019s handling of the 1995 report suffice to state a Fourteenth Amendment claim under the First Circuit\u2019s state\u2011created danger doctrine. While a sympathetic panel might read Irish v. Fowler as opening some space for claims based on investigative actions that increase risk, the complaint here still largely describes failure to protect and misjudgments that do not clearly amount to affirmative enhancement of danger or conscience\u2011shocking deliberate indifference. That, combined with the First Circuit\u2019s historically narrow application of state\u2011created danger, makes affirmance on Issue 1 likely. Without an underlying constitutional violation, the Monell claim against the City and the \u00a71985 conspiracy claims are on even weaker footing; the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed \u00a71985 class is not cognizable under existing law, and the complaint does not allege race\u2011 or similarly suspect\u2011based animus. Those dismissals are therefore likely to be affirmed as well. By contrast, the sua sponte dismissal of the DCF defendants, who had not moved to dismiss and against whom plaintiffs received neither notice nor an opportunity to respond or amend, squarely implicates First Circuit precedent cautioning against such dismissals absent obvious futility. Even if, on remand, the same substantive fate awaits the claims against the DCF individuals, the procedural misstep is sufficiently clear that the appellate court is likely to reverse that aspect of the judgment and remand for further proceedings. Hence a mixed result: affirmance of the substantive rulings as to the moving defendants and Monell\/\u00a71985, but reversal of the sua sponte dismissal of the DCF defendants."

      "factual_background":"The dispute concerns a historic property known as the Gershom Hyde House located at 29 Greenwood Street in Newton, Massachusetts. The building was originally constructed in 1744 and had been designated as a historical landmark subject to local regulation by the Newton Historical Commission.\n\nIn 2017, the Newton Historical Commission issued a permit authorizing a developer to restore the Gershom Hyde House. Later, 29 Greenwood, LLC (\"Greenwood\") purchased the property for approximately $1.15 million. The previously issued construction\/restoration permit was transferred to Greenwood with the sale.\n\nAfter taking ownership, Greenwood began restoration work. It alleges that it soon discovered the building was in much worse physical condition than it had anticipated. Greenwood then tore down large portions of the structure in order, it claims, to reconstruct them in the original style, using many original parts.\n\nThe Newton Historical Commission concluded that Greenwood's actions violated the terms of the permit and a local ordinance governing historical landmarks. The Commission issued a stop-work order, requiring Greenwood to halt restoration, and initiated a criminal complaint seeking to impose fines for the alleged violations. Greenwood disagreed with the Commission\u2019s position but complied with the stop-work order. Although state law provided a mechanism to challenge the Commission\u2019s determination that Greenwood had violated its permit, Greenwood did not use that procedure.\n\nIn efforts to move forward with the project, Greenwood submitted a series of revised proposals to the Commission, seeking issuance of a modified permit to allow reconstruction. The Commission denied all of these applications. Greenwood came to believe that the Commission would not allow it to rebuild the house under any circumstances. Concluding that the property\u2019s value in this partially demolished, unreconstructed condition was low, Greenwood initiated litigation alleging that the Commission\u2019s actions effectively took its property without compensation and that the fines being pursued were unlawfully excessive.",

Separately, before filing this Takings-focused action, Greenwood had already initiated an \"original state-court action\" in Massachusetts Superior Court in September 2022, challenging the Commission's rejection of its remedial\/restoration plans under state law and seeking review and relief on the ground that the Commission\u2019s decisions were unlawful, unreasonable, whimsical, capricious, or arbitrary under Massachusetts standards governing historic district and landmark decisions.",
        "district_court_decision":"In the removed federal action, the defendants moved to dismiss. On April 30, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts characterized the dispute as an ordinary zoning- or land-use-type disagreement between a board and a property owner. Relying on precedent indicating that routine delays and disputes in permitting, zoning, and variances generally do not implicate the federal Takings Clause, the district court concluded that Greenwood\u2019s complaint did not state a cognizable federal Takings claim and dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. The dismissal encompassed the federal and related claims Greenwood had brought in that action.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Greenwood appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of its complaint, challenging the determination that its allegations amounted only to an ordinary local land-use or zoning dispute not rising to the level of a constitutional taking, and seeking reinstatement of its federal Takings and related claims.\n\nThe appeal also arises in the context of parallel and ongoing state proceedings: (1) the original state-court action in Middlesex Superior Court, in which Greenwood is challenging the lawfulness of the Commission\u2019s rejection of its remedial plans under state law, and in which the state court denied the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment and set the case for trial (not yet held); and (2) a criminal proceeding initiated in July 2023 upon the Commission\u2019s application, in which a state court issued a criminal complaint against Greenwood seeking fines for alleged violations related to the historic property. Greenwood sought an emergency stay of the criminal proceedings in the original state-court action, but the state court denied that emergency relief while retaining jurisdiction over Greenwood's state-law challenges to the Commission\u2019s conduct."

Under ordinary pleading standards, the current allegations are speculative as to both the imposition and the magnitude of any fines.

The federal Takings theory\u2014and any eventual Eighth Amendment challenge\u2014depend in significant part on antecedent, unsettled state\u2011law questions (e.g., the scope of the Commission\u2019s authority, the interpretation of the ordinance, and whether Greenwood in fact violated its permit). State\u2011court resolutions could moot or substantially narrow the federal issues. Under these circumstances, dismissal on the merits instead of staying or abstaining falls outside the range of reasonable case\u2011management options.

      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",
      "confidence":0.74,
      "reasoning":"The district court\u2019s core legal determination\u2014that the complaint alleges only an ordinary land\u2011use dispute not rising to a takings claim\u2014is vulnerable on de novo review because it effectively weighs the factual severity of the alleged regulatory burden rather than simply asking whether the facts, if true, plausibly cross the threshold for a Fifth Amendment claim. Modern takings and pleading precedents permit as\u2011applied regulatory takings claims based on patterns of denial and obstruction that allegedly deprive the owner of viable use; Greenwood\u2019s allegations of categorical refusal to allow any reconstruction and of leaving the property in a non\u2011usable, partially demolished state are sufficient to plead such a claim. The panel is therefore likely to reverse the dismissal of the Takings claim and hold that it is at least plausibly pled.\n\nAt the same time, the court will be acutely aware of parallel state proceedings directly addressing the lawfulness of the Commission\u2019s actions. Those proceedings present unsettled issues of Massachusetts law whose resolution may moot or significantly reshape the federal constitutional analysis. That is a classic setting for Pullman\u2011type abstention and a stay, not final dismissal. Thus, the court is likely to remand with instructions to reinstate the Takings claim but stay it pending the outcome of the state litigation.\n\nBy contrast, the excessive\u2011fines claim is more clearly premature. No final fine has been imposed; the criminal case is ongoing; the underlying violation is contested; and federal adjudication now would interfere with state criminal enforcement. On these grounds, the appellate court can comfortably affirm dismissal of that claim, likely without prejudice. Taken together, this yields a mixed outcome: reversal as to the dismissal of the Takings claim (with directions to stay under abstention principles) and affirmance as to the dismissal or non\u2011adjudication of the excessive\u2011fines claim."

      },
      "factual_background":"Khalilah Suluki alleges that her mother, Khadijah Suluki, stole her identity and opened multiple credit card accounts in Khalilah\u2019s name without permission, including an account with Credit One Bank. Before college, Khalilah and Khadijah discussed building Khalilah\u2019s credit. Following Khadijah\u2019s advice, Khalilah applied for her first credit card with Discover when she began college, with Khadijah present and assisting. Khadijah also helped Khalilah apply for retail store cards, such as Century 21 and American Eagle, and sent money that Khalilah used to make payments on those cards while at college. Khadijah also opened a separate Credit One account with Khalilah\u2019s sister, Taheerah, to build Taheerah\u2019s credit.\n\nOn November 2, 2017, an online application was submitted to open a Credit One credit card using Khalilah\u2019s name, date of birth, childhood Brooklyn address, Social Security number, and the email address \"ksuluki@yahoo.com.\" The card was first used in December 2017 in Brooklyn and remained open for over 18 months. Account statements show the card was used largely for miscellaneous purchases at retail stores and restaurants in the Brooklyn area, including merchants such as American Eagle, Adidas, and Uniqlo. Minimum or partial payments were made every month from a Chase bank account jointly held by Khalilah and Khadijah. In August 2020, after Khalilah had raised identity theft allegations and disputed the account, the remaining balance on the Credit One card was paid in full.\n\nIn March 2019, while on a family vacation to Puerto Rico for Khalilah\u2019s birthday, Khalilah and her family argued, and upon returning home, Khadijah told Khalilah to leave the family home. In July 2019, Khalilah applied to rent an apartment and was rejected, which prompted her to obtain her credit reports from Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union. Upon reviewing them, she states she discovered that, during the time she was away at college, she had been the victim of identity theft by Khadijah, who had opened various accounts in her name and had maxed out some of her pre-existing accounts. One of the accounts appearing on her reports was the Credit One account.\n\nOn July 6, 2019, Khalilah called Credit One and reported that she had not opened the account and did not know who had done so. During that call, she initially gave a different telephone number than the one on the account, but then identified the number associated with the account as her mother\u2019s phone number. The Credit One representative advised her that the account balance was $562.47 and confirmed that she was reporting the account as fraudulent and that she had not applied for the card. Credit One closed the account pursuant to its normal policy, opened an investigation, and requested that she obtain a police or other law enforcement identity theft report.\n\nKhalilah went to a local police precinct in Coney Island (West 8th Street) to file a report, but officers told her she needed certain paperwork from Credit One; she understood Credit One wanted a police report, and the police wanted documentation from Credit One. After this back-and-forth, she decided not to obtain a police report. By the end of that summer, she had called Credit One \"two, maybe three\" times to report fraud and then retained an attorney.\n\nAfter Khalilah reported the account as fraudulent, Credit One attempted to contact Khadijah and left messages. On July 25, 2019, Khadijah called Credit One and told a representative that the account was not fraudulent. She stated that she and Khalilah opened the account together when Khalilah was in college, with the understanding that Khadijah would make the payments on the card to help build Khalilah\u2019s credit. She asserted there had been no forgery or fraud, that she had been making the monthly payments, and that she would remain responsible for paying off the balance. The representative informed her that the account was already closed and the outstanding balance was $562.47.\n\nOn August 15, 2019, Credit One sent Khalilah a letter requesting additional information and enclosing a form affidavit for her to complete. The letter asked her to provide an \"Identity Theft Report\" filed with law enforcement or a postal inspector. On August 29, 2019, Khalilah returned the completed affidavit but did not supply an identity theft report. In the affidavit, she asserted that she did not apply for the Credit One card and was not aware of the charges. She identified the \"suspect\" as \"Khadijah Suluki\" in one field but then wrote her own name and Social Security number in the space meant for the suspect\u2019s identifying information. The affidavit also instructed her to initial all transactions not authorized by her; she did not do so. \n\nOn November 10, 2019, with apparent assistance from counsel, Khalilah sent dispute letters to Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union. In these letters she asserted that her mother had used her information to open accounts in her name without her agreement, specifically mentioning a Century 21 account and stating that these accounts were opened while she was away at college. She also stated that her mother opened a Credit One account. She did not attach an identity theft report to these letters. On April 28, 2020, she sent a new round of dispute letters to the CRAs, stating that Khadijah had opened Capital One and Credit One accounts and that she herself never made the charges or used the Century 21 account. These letters did not contain new documentary information or an identity theft report.\n\nDuring this period, Credit One continued to receive regular and generally timely payments on the disputed account from the joint Chase account until the balance was paid in full in August 2020.\n\nCredit One maintained internal notes (\"Notes\") on the account reflecting the course of events. According to the Notes, the July 6, 2019 call from Khalilah triggered an investigation, which concluded with a determination that the cardholder (Khalilah) was responsible for the account. The Notes record the July 20, 2019 call in which Khalilah again said she did not open the account, the July 25, 2019 call from Khadijah in which she identified herself as Khalilah\u2019s mother and said she would take responsibility for the account, and Credit One\u2019s further investigative steps, including after receiving the completed affidavit of fraud. The Notes indicate that on or about September 17, 2019, Credit One sent a letter to Khalilah advising her that she was deemed responsible for the account.\n\nIn addition to its internal investigation, Credit One received automated consumer dispute verifications (\"ACDVs\") from the CRAs in connection with Khalilah\u2019s disputes. An ACDV is an automated request used by CRAs to ask furnishers to verify, update, or delete tradeline information in a consumer\u2019s credit file. Consumer disputes submitted to CRAs are transmitted as ACDVs to furnishers. Credit One\u2019s policy is to investigate each ACDV that claims fraud. Credit One received six ACDVs concerning Khalilah\u2019s disputes\u2014four in late November 2019 over about a week and two more in May 2020. When multiple identical ACDVs are received within a 30-day period, Credit One typically conducts a full investigation on the first and applies the result to the identical subsequent disputes.\n\nTwo specific ACDV investigations are described in the record. John Perry, a Credit One fraud specialist, handled the November 29, 2019 dispute notice from Experian. He followed Credit One\u2019s investigative procedures for identity-theft disputes. These procedures require review of the ACDV and its dispute code; any documents attached; Credit One\u2019s internal databases; and external data sources such as Experian and LexisNexis (\"Lexis\"), using both internal and external sources to identify potential links to the person committing the alleged fraudulent activity. Under Credit One policy, at least two strong links are required when holding a consumer responsible, and the links should be relevant to the consumer\u2019s claim. The Notes are also available to investigators.\n\nPerry reviewed the ACDV, which bore dispute code \"103,\" indicating an allegation that the account was opened fraudulently. He then reviewed documents Experian transmitted, which included Khalilah\u2019s dispute letter and copies (described as illegible) of her driver\u2019s license and Social Security card. He compared the Social Security number in the ACDV with Credit One\u2019s records and confirmed a match. He consulted Credit One\u2019s application database, including a \"fraud\" tab showing the Early Warning Services (\"EWS\") score and \"Precise ID Fraud Shield Indicators\"\u2014third\u2011party tools used to assess risk of fraud. Khalilah\u2019s account had an EWS score of zero and only two \"T\" indicators, whereas a higher score and more than three T indicators would prompt an especially thorough investigation.\n\nPerry also reviewed the \"Red Flag\" tab, which tracks whether phone numbers or email addresses associated with one application were used for other Credit One applications and whether those linked accounts show fraud indicators. For Khalilah\u2019s account, the Red Flag tab showed that the phone number and email address were also associated with Taheerah\u2019s Credit One account, but did not show any fraud alerts; Taheerah\u2019s account was open and current. Seeing no red flags in these metrics, Perry reviewed the payment history and observed a consistent pattern of payments and no disputes of individual transactions. He also checked the phone database, noting that the same phone number appeared on the application and was used in connection with payments. Using Lexis, he verified that the address, phone number, and Social Security number on the account were all associated with Khalilah, and that these associations predated the opening of the account. Based on this information, he concluded that the evidence supported treating Khalilah as responsible for the account and responded to Experian that Credit One\u2019s reporting was accurate.\n\nAnother Credit One investigator, Adoria Reaux, conducted a similar investigation of the April 2020 disputes and followed the same basic procedure, independently reviewing internal and external data before again determining that the account should remain reported as belonging to Khalilah.\n\nKhalilah and Khadijah gave conflicting accounts about whether the Credit One account was opened with Khalilah\u2019s knowledge and consent. Khalilah maintains that she did not authorize her mother to open the account and was unaware of it until reviewing her credit reports in 2019. Khadijah told Credit One that she and Khalilah opened the account together in order to build Khalilah\u2019s credit and that she was making payments on the account for that purpose. The record also reflects that both Khalilah and Khadijah were associated with the physical address and phone number used on the account, that the email address used resembled Khalilah\u2019s name, that the payments were made from a joint account in both their names, and that the purchases on the account were broadly consistent with Khalilah\u2019s demographics and location at the time.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On February 9, 2021, Khalilah Suluki filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Capital One Bank, N.A., Comenity Capital Bank, and Credit One Bank, N.A., alleging violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et seq. As relevant to Credit One, she alleged that Credit One violated the FCRA by failing to conduct a reasonable investigation of her disputes that the Credit One account was the product of identity theft, and by providing or continuing to furnish inaccurate information to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). She also alleged that Credit One\u2019s conduct was willful or, alternatively, negligent, making it liable for statutory, punitive, and\/or actual damages and attorney\u2019s fees under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n and 1681o.",
        "district_court_decision":"Credit One answered the complaint on April 8, 2021. Khalilah voluntarily dismissed her claims against Capital One Bank on September 22, 2021, and against Comenity Capital Bank on October 14, 2021, leaving Credit One as the remaining defendant. After discovery, Khalilah moved for summary judgment, arguing that: (1) Credit One\u2019s reporting that the account belonged to her was inaccurate as a matter of law; (2) Credit One failed to properly report the results of its investigation to the CRAs; and (3) Credit One\u2019s investigation of her identity theft claim was unreasonable as a matter of law. Credit One cross-moved for summary judgment, arguing that: (1) its investigation was reasonable as a matter of law; and (2) regardless of the reasonableness of its investigation, it had not acted willfully, and thus could not be liable for willful damages; and that she could not prove negligent noncompliance causing actionable damages. \n\nThe district court denied Khalilah\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its entirety. It held that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the information Credit One furnished about the account\u2019s ownership was accurate, so summary judgment in Khalilah\u2019s favor on that point was inappropriate. The court also rejected her contention that Credit One\u2019s investigation was unreasonable as a matter of law. The district court granted Credit One\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It concluded that, even assuming questions existed about the adequacy of the investigation and the accuracy of the information, no reasonable jury could find that a more thorough or different reasonable investigation would have caused Credit One to conclude that the account was fraudulent or unverifiable, and thus that Khalilah could not establish causation between any alleged investigative deficiency and her claimed harm. Based on that conclusion, the court further determined that Khalilah had not adduced evidence from which a reasonable jury could find a willful or negligent violation of the FCRA sufficient to support damages. The district court also held that, under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(d), Khalilah could not pursue a private claim for any alleged failure by Credit One to flag the tradeline as disputed under \u00a7 1681s-2(a), and Khalilah did not challenge that point on appeal.",

She specifically appeals the determinations that: (1) even assuming deficiencies in Credit One\u2019s investigation, no reasonable investigation would have produced a different outcome regarding whether the account was fraudulent or unverifiable, thereby negating causation; and (2) the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to allow a jury to find that Credit One\u2019s conduct constituted a willful violation of the FCRA or a negligent violation causing compensable damages. She does not appeal the district court\u2019s conclusion that there is no private right of action to enforce \u00a7 1681s\u20112(a)\u2019s duty to note disputes when furnishing information to CRAs."

It maintains that it followed detailed written procedures for identity\u2011theft disputes, including reviewing the ACDVs and their codes, the dispute letters and attachments, internal account and application databases (including fraud and red-flag indicators), payment history, phone and email usage, and external data sources such as Lexis to confirm the associations of the address, phone number, and Social Security number with Khalilah.",
          "It emphasizes that multiple data points linked Khalilah to the account: her name, Social Security number, long-standing association with the address and phone number used, the email address resembling her name, the use of a joint bank account she shared with Khadijah to make regular payments over an extended period, and the fact that there were no disputed transactions. It describes consistent, timely payments as atypical of identity theft cases and notes that the purchases were consistent with Khalilah\u2019s age, gender, and Brooklyn residence.",
          "Credit One contends that it did review Khalilah\u2019s affidavit and other materials, and that even if anything was overlooked, the affidavit itself was internally inconsistent and incomplete (lacking a law enforcement identity theft report, not initialing specific unauthorized transactions, and misidentifying suspect information), such that no reasonable investigation would have produced a different conclusion about account ownership.",
          "On causation, Credit One argues that Khalilah has not identified any additional evidence that a more extensive or different investigation would have uncovered that would have changed the outcome. It stresses that the conflicting statements from Khalilah and Khadijah, the payment history, and the data associations do not compel a finding of fraud by Khadijah and that, therefore, any alleged shortcomings in its investigative method could not be shown to have caused her alleged injuries.",
          "Regarding willfulness, Credit One maintains that its conduct does not rise to reckless or knowing violation of the FCRA. It asserts that it followed structured procedures consistent with industry practices and existing law, and that no appellate or agency guidance condemned its approach, particularly in intra-family identity theft situations. It argues that the Wood district court decision does not constitute authoritative guidance under Safeco and thus cannot transform its investigative approach into a willful FCRA violation.",
          "On negligence and actual damages, Credit One argues that Khalilah failed to establish that any negligent noncompliance with \u00a7 1681s-2(b) caused her specific injuries, as opposed to those injuries stemming from the underlying disputed debt itself or other credit factors. It contends that, absent proof that a reasonable investigation would have revealed inaccuracy or unverifiability and led to different reporting, she cannot recover under \u00a7 1681o."

          "reasoning":"The question is whether, taking the record in the light most favorable to Suluki, a reasonable jury could find that a reasonable \u00a71681s\u20112(b) investigation would likely have produced a different outcome (fraud or unverifiable account), thereby establishing causation. The record shows numerous strong links tying the account to Suluki: her correct SSN; childhood address long associated with her; phone and email associated with her (and also with her sister\u2019s verified Credit One account); consistent, timely payments from a joint bank account in her and her mother\u2019s names for more than 18 months; use in the Brooklyn area consistent with her residence and demographics; and no prior disputes of specific transactions. The only contrary evidence is her later assertion of identity theft and a defective affidavit lacking a police report and failing to identify specific unauthorized charges, contrasted with the mother\u2019s admission that the account was opened to build Suluki\u2019s credit with the mother\u2019s help. In light of these undisputed objective links and internally inconsistent theft claim, the panel is likely to agree that Suluki has not identified any concrete additional investigative step that could reasonably be expected to change Credit One\u2019s conclusion. Under Second Circuit and other circuits\u2019 \u00a71681s\u20112(b) causation precedents, this failure is fatal at summary judgment. Thus the district court\u2019s conclusion\u2014that even assuming arguendo some investigative deficiency, no reasonable jury could find that a proper investigation would have revealed fraud or unverifiability\u2014is likely to be affirmed."

Under Safeco, an interpretation or practice is not willful if it is not objectively unreasonable in light of statutory text and authoritative guidance. Here, there is no binding appellate or agency authority declaring Credit One\u2019s kind of multi\u2011factor identity\u2011theft investigation\u2014reliance on accurate identifiers, payment history, fraud\u2011scoring tools, and external databases\u2014per se inadequate, particularly in an intra\u2011family dispute. The bank did not simply match a name and SSN; it followed a documented procedure, used internal and external tools, and documented reasons for treating the account as the consumer\u2019s. One out\u2011of\u2011circuit or district\u2011court decision (such as Wood) criticizing aspects of earlier Credit One procedures is not \u201cauthoritative guidance\u201d sufficient to make continued use of structured investigations objectively unreasonable under Safeco.

Even assuming a jury could find Credit One\u2019s investigation negligent, Suluki must still show that a reasonable investigation would probably have led Credit One to conclude the account was fraudulent or unverifiable and thus to stop reporting it as hers. For the reasons underlying Issue 1, the objective links and conflicting statements make it speculative that any additional steps (beyond what Credit One did) would have resulted in a different outcome. Without a non\u2011speculative showing that a proper investigation would have altered the tradeline reporting, harms such as credit denials or emotional distress are not attributable to any FCRA noncompliance as opposed to the existence of the debt or other negative items. Under Second Circuit causation doctrine in FCRA negligence cases, this evidentiary gap justifies summary judgment, and the district court\u2019s determination that she cannot recover negligence\u2011based damages is likely to be affirmed."

      "reasoning":"All appealed issues arise from the grant of summary judgment, reviewed de novo. The record is strongly weighted toward Credit One on the causation element: there is substantial, undisputed objective evidence connecting Suluki to the account, and she has not identified specific, realistic investigative steps that would likely have uncovered evidence compelling a contrary finding of fraud or unverifiability. Appellate courts in FCRA furnisher cases commonly affirm where the plaintiff cannot bridge this causation gap, even while assuming arguendo some investigatory shortcomings. Given that premise, both her negligence and willfulness theories founder: without showing that a reasonable investigation would have changed the reporting, she cannot establish actual damages for negligence, and the existence of structured, multi\u2011factor investigatory procedures precludes a finding that Credit One acted in objectively unreasonable disregard of clearly established law. The district court\u2019s reasoning fits comfortably within prevailing interpretations of \u00a71681s\u20112(b), Safeco\u2019s willfulness framework, and causation requirements under \u00a7\u00a71681n and 1681o, making an across\u2011the\u2011board affirmance the most likely appellate disposition."

      },
      "factual_background":"According to the operative complaint, Broc T. Waltermeyer is a federal prisoner who was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Berlin, New Hampshire, from May 2018 through July 2019. After July 2019, he was transferred to another federal correctional facility, FCC Coleman Low, where he remained incarcerated at the time of the appeal.\n\nDuring his incarceration at FCI Berlin, Waltermeyer suffered from chronic knee pain. In September 2018, he requested diagnostic imaging of his knee. The prison physician at FCI Berlin, defendant Dr. Diane Kistler, honored his request, sought and received approval for an MRI, and the MRI was performed a little over two months later. Waltermeyer attached the MRI results to his original pleading, and those results are treated as part of the operative complaint.\n\nThe MRI report reflects that Dr. Kistler reviewed the results. Handwritten notes on the report state, among other things: \"no surgery needed,\" \"physical therapy,\" and \"ultimate solution: knee total replacement.\" The notes also set out an \"interim solution\" consisting of: (1) chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine supplements; (2) knee bracing; (3) no sports or weightlifting; (4) pendulum exercises twice a day, 50 repetitions; and (5) medication for pain (the note reads \"on . . . lam [sic] for pain\"). According to the complaint, Dr. Kistler told Waltermeyer that an outside specialist had recommended deferring knee replacement surgery until he was older.\n\nHaving reviewed the MRI results and outside recommendations, Dr. Kistler declined to order knee replacement surgery at that time. Instead, she pursued non\u2011surgical treatment options. The complaint acknowledges that these non-surgical alternatives and accommodations were provided. Specifically, Waltermeyer received bi\u2011annual cortisone injections (though he wished to receive them monthly), pain medication, special shoes, knee braces, access to a low bunk, and a cane. He nonetheless asserts that he continued to experience pain. He alleges that when he complained of his pain, Dr. Kistler frequently responded with statements such as \"you just got[ta] deal with the pain\" or \"[you] just ha[ve] to get use[d] [to] the pain.\"\n\nWaltermeyer\u2019s position, as reflected in his pleadings, is that, despite some treatment, he was denied the specific treatment he believed medically necessary\u2014knee replacement surgery. He contends that the benefits of surgical knee replacement outweighed the risks, regardless of his age or other conditions, and characterizes the refusal to authorize surgery as constitutionally deficient medical care comparable to that alleged in Carlson v. Green. The complaint does not allege that the medical facilities at FCI Berlin were grossly inadequate overall, nor does it allege that medical staff administered contraindicated drugs or knowingly used inoperative medical devices. It focuses instead on the choice of conservative, non-surgical management and the timing and nature of treatments for his knee pain.\n\nIn addition to his knee condition, Waltermeyer initially raised claims relating to alleged inadequate treatment for Hepatitis C and a lipoma, but he later received further treatment for those conditions and dropped those claims.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On March 6, 2019, while still housed at FCI Berlin, Waltermeyer filed a pro se civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire against FCI Berlin physician Dr. Diane Kistler and Warden Robert Hazlewood. He also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. As relevant to this appeal, he asserted a damages claim under the Eighth Amendment, invoking Bivens-type authority, alleging that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs by failing to provide the knee surgery he sought and instead offering only conservative treatment. In the same action, he initially asserted claims concerning Hepatitis C and a lipoma and named additional unnamed defendants, but he later abandoned the Hepatitis C and lipoma claims after receiving further treatment, and the district court dismissed the unnamed defendants. Those other claims and parties are not at issue on appeal.",
        "district_court_decision":"The defendants moved to dismiss and opposed the motion for a preliminary injunction. A magistrate judge recommended denial of the preliminary injunction as moot because Waltermeyer had been transferred from FCI Berlin to another federal facility, FCC Coleman Low, and the named defendants\u2014officials at FCI Berlin\u2014no longer had responsibility for his medical care. The district court adopted that recommendation and denied the preliminary injunction on mootness grounds.\n\nFollowing Waltermeyer\u2019s transfer, he amended his complaint to seek only money damages, dropping requests for injunctive relief. In light of the amended pleadings and attached Bureau of Prisons records, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint. In its published decision, the court concluded that Waltermeyer could not maintain his Bivens\u2011type Eighth Amendment damages claim because an alternative administrative remedy existed for his complaint about medical care, and therefore a judicially implied damages remedy was unavailable.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Waltermeyer filed a timely appeal to the First Circuit, challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Eighth Amendment damages claim. On appeal, he contests the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claim is barred on the ground that an alternative administrative remedy precludes recognition of a Bivens\u2011type damages action. He also contends that his claim does not arise in a \"new context\" under the Supreme Court\u2019s Bivens jurisprudence and should be treated as within the existing Eighth Amendment context recognized in Carlson v.

Here, the complaint itself shows that the prison doctor ordered an MRI, followed a specialist\u2019s recommendation to defer surgery, and provided extensive conservative treatment (injections, medication, braces, cane, low bunk, etc.). The alleged wrong is essentially disagreement with medical judgment and timing, not denial of care or grossly inadequate facilities.

      "reasoning":"The core of the appeal is whether the Eighth Amendment medical\u2011care claim can proceed as a Bivens damages action. Under current Supreme Court precedent, lower courts are instructed to be extremely reluctant to extend Bivens beyond the specific scenarios in Bivens, Davis, and Carlson. While Carlson remains good law, Egbert and Ziglar emphasize that even claims under the same constitutional provision, and even in the same general setting (federal prison), will usually be treated as presenting a new context if the factual pattern and kind of official conduct differ in any meaningful way. Here, the complaint affirmatively shows that Waltermeyer did receive ongoing medical treatment; his claim focuses on the denial of a particular treatment (knee replacement surgery) and his disagreement with the doctor\u2019s medical judgment, which materially differs from the extreme systemic medical neglect and life\u2011threatening misconduct in Carlson. That difference is sufficient for a new context finding. Once in the new\u2011context box, Egbert makes the special\u2011factors inquiry essentially one\u2011sided: any plausible separation\u2011of\u2011powers concern or existing remedial scheme requires the court to refuse to extend Bivens. The availability of the BOP\u2019s Administrative Remedy Program and the risk of inserting courts into routine prison medical decision\u2011making both qualify as special factors counseling hesitation. Accordingly, the First Circuit is likely to affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Bivens claim on the ground that no damages remedy is available, without reaching or resolving whether the alleged conduct would amount to deliberate indifference on the merits. The preliminary\u2011injunction issue is effectively moot and not pressed; the only live question is the availability of a Bivens remedy, and on that point the district court\u2019s judgment is almost certain to be affirmed in full."

The attacks were allegedly committed, planned, or authorized by a network referred to as the \u201cSyndicate,\u201d described as a complex joint venture of terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan led by al-Qaeda and including the Taliban and the Haqqani Network. Al-Qaeda was designated a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in 1999 and the Haqqani Network in 2012.\n\nPlaintiffs seek to hold three banking groups liable for allegedly aiding and abetting these attacks: SCB, Deutsche Bank, and Danske Bank. The core theory is that these banks knowingly provided banking and financial services to non\u2011terrorist entities and individuals that were, in various ways, closely connected to the Syndicate or to terrorist financing schemes, thereby indirectly supplying crucial financial resources and material support that facilitated the terrorist attacks.\n\n1. SCB and Pakistani fertilizer companies\n\nSCB allegedly provided financial services to two related Pakistani fertilizer producers, Fatima Fertilizer Company Limited and Pakarab Fertilizers Limited (the Companies), which had a near\u2011monopoly in Pakistan on calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) fertilizer. The Companies legally produced CAN and other fertilizers marketed to Pakistani farmers. \n\nBeginning around 2008, the Syndicate increasingly used ammonium nitrate bombs derived from CAN fertilizer. By 2009, ammonium nitrate fertilizer bombs had reportedly become the deadliest weapons used by Syndicate terrorists against Americans. In 2010, the Afghan government banned possession, production, and importation of CAN, but smuggling of CAN from Pakistan into Afghanistan remained widespread. A 2011 Associated Press article reported that militants and others smuggled CAN across the border and identified the Companies as producers of the fertilizer used in bombs killing Americans. U.S. military leadership concluded that about one percent of the Companies\u2019 CAN output was diverted to insurgents, and that this relatively small portion nevertheless accounted for the majority of IEDs and a very high percentage of U.S. casualties in Afghanistan.\n\nU.S. officials attempted to persuade the Companies to implement measures to prevent diversion of CAN to terrorists, including adding a color or odor to CAN for detection at the Afghan\u2013Pakistani border. The Companies declined. Reports and lawmakers suggested that elements of Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service might be influencing the Companies\u2019 refusal and using the fertilizer pipeline to support groups like the Haqqani Network.\n\nThe U.S. military then turned to pressure actors within the Companies\u2019 supply and financial chain. In 2012, U.S. military personnel began identifying corporations and banks believed to be facilitating the CAN pipeline and contacted them to encourage changes in practice. SCB, one of the Companies\u2019 major bankers since at least 2009, provided foreign exchange, export finance, and letter\u2011of\u2011credit services to the Companies. In a January 2013 New York meeting, Lieutenant General Mike Barbero and others allegedly informed senior SCB executives that: (1) CAN produced by the Companies was involved in approximately 80% of American bomb casualties in Afghanistan; (2) the Companies had repeatedly refused to cooperate with U.S. efforts to curtail the flow of CAN into Afghanistan; and (3) SCB\u2019s financial services were, according to the military, irreplaceable for enabling the Companies to maintain large\u2011scale fertilizer production and supply, which in turn sustained the CAN\u2011based IED campaign. The military urged SCB to stop providing services to the Companies on the ground that doing so could save American lives. Plaintiffs allege SCB nevertheless continued its banking relationship with the Companies.\n\n2. Money laundering schemes allegedly linked to the Syndicate\n\nPlaintiffs allege that SCB, Deutsche Bank, and Danske Bank participated in, or facilitated, large\u2011scale money laundering operations that, in turn, were used by or benefitted the Syndicate. They contend that all three banks prioritized profits, operated in high\u2011risk terrorist\u2011finance jurisdictions (including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia), and had deficient anti\u2011money\u2011laundering and counter\u2011terrorist\u2011financing controls, which allowed criminal money laundering that provided the Syndicate with regular, predictable cash flows in U.S. dollars.\n\n2(a). SCB and Altaf Khanani organization\n\nFrom 2008 through 2016, SCB provided U.S. dollar services to two Emirati entities: Al Zarooni Exchange and Mazaka General Trading. Plaintiffs allege that these entities were fronts for Altaf Khanani, an internationally known money launderer for Syndicate\u2011linked groups. Khanani allegedly used SCB accounts for Al Zarooni and Mazaka to conduct USD\u2011denominated transactions and repatriate the funds to accounts controlled by al\u2011Qaeda, the Haqqani Network, and other Syndicate members. Media reports in the early 2000s had linked Khanani and his currency exchange firm to terrorist financing. In 2008, Khanani was charged in Pakistan with laundering billions of dollars annually; he allegedly avoided conviction through a bribe, moved to Dubai, and continued laundering until his 2015 arrest by U.S. authorities. Plaintiffs allege his network continued operating after his 2016 conviction.\n\nAccording to the complaint, during a 2012\u20132013 terrorism\u2011related audit, a senior SCB Dubai compliance employee learned that SCB Dubai, using SCB New York as a correspondent, processed U.S. dollar transactions for known Khanani fronts and that Khanani was suspected of laundering funds for anti\u2011American terrorist groups. A whistleblower allegedly identified many SCB transactions for Al Zarooni after 2008, and SCB purportedly retaliated against personnel who raised terrorism\u2011related concerns. Plaintiffs estimate that SCB facilitated at least $5.35 million in terrorist financing through Khanani\u2011linked transactions between 2009 and 2016.\n\nPlaintiffs further note that in 2012 SCB entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia and a consent order with New York regulators concerning services to Iranian terrorist fronts, and in 2014 admitted to deficiencies in its New York branch\u2019s anti\u2011money\u2011laundering surveillance.\n\n2(b). Deutsche Bank and the \u201cRussian Laundromat\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs allege Deutsche Bank set up and operated an extensive money laundering system dubbed the \u201cRussian Laundromat.\u201d In 2011, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head equities trader in Moscow allegedly met with two well\u2011known money launderers tied to Russian organized crime to design a mirror\u2011trading scheme that allowed conversion of rubles into U.S. dollars and cross\u2011border transfer without scrutiny. The scheme involved coordinated purchase and sale of the same Russian securities in rubles and dollars through different companies under common control.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Russian Mafia, including organizations they characterize as narco\u2011terrorist cartels, used this Laundromat to convert rubles obtained from purchasing opium from al\u2011Qaeda and the Taliban into U.S. dollars, providing a key source of Syndicate terrorist finance. They further contend Deutsche Bank used the Laundromat to execute trades for Khanani\u2019s fronts (Al Zarooni and Mazaka), ultimately enabling tens of millions of dollars to reach the Syndicate. Only large global banks, they allege, could process the bulk seven\u2011 and eight\u2011figure U.S. dollar transfers common in the Syndicate\u2019s opium trade.\n\nA Cypriot bank reportedly found transaction patterns with Deutsche Bank suspicious in 2014 and asked Deutsche Bank London for information. The Moscow equities head allegedly replied that the counterparty had passed Deutsche Bank\u2019s know\u2011your\u2011customer procedures and that there was no reason for concern, which plaintiffs characterize as a misrepresentation made to protect the mirror\u2011trading scheme. He later publicly stated that Deutsche Bank\u2019s compliance department must have known of the mirror trades because he obtained approvals from senior managers in London.\n\n2(c). Danske Bank and the \u201cGlobal Laundromat\u201d\n\nDanske Bank\u2019s Estonian branch allegedly ran another large\u2011scale money laundering scheme called the \u201cGlobal Laundromat,\u201d conducting more than $233 billion in suspicious transactions from 2007 to 2016. In 2022, Danske Bank pled guilty in the United States to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and agreed to a large forfeiture related to its Estonian operations.\n\nWhistleblowers and internal auditors reportedly raised concerns about these operations. In 2013, an Estonia branch employee reported that Danske Bank continued dealing with a customer it knew had committed crimes, and in 2014 internal audit found that branch staff had concealed identities of suspicious clients from authorities. Plaintiffs allege that the branch\u2019s high profitability and the volume of U.S. dollar transactions should have raised red flags.\n\nThey link this to the Syndicate via a customer of the Estonian branch\u2014allegedly with \u201chidden owners\u201d\u2014that exchanged millions with Mazaka. A German news report cited in the complaint states that $720,000 flowed into Mazaka\u2019s Danske Bank account.\n\n3. VAT fraud schemes and alleged terrorist financing\n\nPlaintiffs also allege that SCB, Deutsche Bank, and Danske Bank were involved in or facilitated value\u2011added tax (VAT) fraud schemes in Europe that generated funds for the Syndicate. VAT is a sales tax paid at each stage of distribution; fraud schemes can involve chains of sham businesses and fake invoices to obtain improper VAT refunds, sometimes referred to as carousel fraud. Public reports since around 2006 have linked such fraud to terrorist financing.\n\nThe theory is that the Syndicate created VAT fraud \u201ccells\u201d in Europe to obtain fraudulent tax refunds. The proceeds were laundered through international banks to convert Euros into U.S. dollars, which the Syndicate allegedly preferred for financing its operations.\n\n3(a). The Samir Azizi scheme (SCB and Deutsche Bank)\n\nOne scheme was allegedly run by Samir Azizi, a young Afghan national described as a Syndicate operative. Azizi bought cell phones in the United States and shipped them to Afghanistan through Europe and Dubai, claiming sham VAT refunds at intermediate steps. Plaintiffs allege that from about 2009 until Azizi\u2019s arrest in 2015, Deutsche Bank accounts were used in his scheme and SCB transferred funds on the scheme\u2019s behalf, facilitating purchases and routing millions of dollars likely to the Syndicate. Plaintiffs assert that Azizi told law enforcement, after his arrest, that SCB had made available a company vital to his VAT scheme and that Deutsche Bank had been a willing financial partner. The complaint does not allege that either bank was prosecuted for its role.\n\nDeutsche Bank employees also allegedly traded carbon emissions certificates in a manner intertwined with Azizi\u2019s and other VAT fraud schemes. The fraud exploited differences in VAT treatment in cross\u2011border emissions trading; Deutsche Bank purportedly bought certificates from front companies, exported and re\u2011introduced them into the system, using a program enabling very rapid transfers and multilayered account movements. A Deutsche Bank compliance employee later identified the carbon market as showing characteristics of sales tax fraud, and German authorities conducted searches of Deutsche Bank\u2019s offices in 2010 and 2012 on suspicion of aiding and abetting VAT fraud, leading to charges against some employees. The complaint does not allege charges against Deutsche Bank itself.\n\n3(b). The Imran Yakub Ahmed scheme (Deutsche Bank)\n\nPlaintiffs allege that British\u2011Pakistani citizen Imran Yakub Ahmed ran major VAT fraud schemes that raised over a billion Euros. From 2005 to 2010, Deutsche Bank purportedly facilitated transactions for Ahmed, resulting in at least $10 million in financing repatriated to the Syndicate. Ahmed was convicted by an Italian court in 2017 for conspiracy to steal VAT. The complaint does not allege criminal charges against Deutsche Bank for its role.\n\n3(c). Swefin and Danish VAT fraud (Danske Bank)\n\nPlaintiffs allege that in 2009, a Danske Bank branch in Denmark allowed accounts controlled by a Danish company, Swefin, to conduct VAT fraud exceeding $100 million, and that the same account was used in 2010 for a similar scheme targeting Spanish tax authorities. They further claim that Denmark was a hotspot for VAT\u2011based terrorist financing, with published reports estimating that VAT fraud in Denmark accounted for approximately $12 million in terrorist finance.\n\n4. Alleged overall \u201cTaliban\u2013al\u2011Qaeda Campaign\u201d\n\nBeyond specific attacks, plaintiffs characterize the Syndicate\u2019s activities as a broader \u201cTaliban\u2011al\u2011Qaeda Campaign,\u201d described as an enterprise of terrorist organizations engaged in a long\u2011running pattern of racketeering activities designed to expel Americans from Afghanistan through violent acts. They allege that the banks\u2019 various financial services and transactions\u2014fertilizer\u2011related, money laundering, and VAT fraud\u2014collectively supported this broader campaign by supplying funds and resources, even where the immediate recipients of the banks\u2019 services were not themselves designated terrorist organizations.",

          "Regarding SCB and the fertilizer companies, plaintiffs contend that SCB\u2019s services\u2014foreign exchange, export finance, and letters of credit\u2014were critical to the Companies\u2019 ability to produce and sell CAN fertilizer at low cost and in large quantities, and that CAN was the primary explosive ingredient in IEDs responsible for the vast majority of U.S. casualties. They emphasize that after the January 2013 meeting with Lieutenant General Barbero, SCB had explicit notice that its services were enabling the continuation of a fertilizer supply chain closely linked to terrorist bombings, yet it chose to continue the relationship, thereby acting with at least reckless disregard tantamount to knowing and substantial assistance.",
          "With respect to money laundering, plaintiffs maintain that SCB, Deutsche Bank, and Danske Bank deliberately cultivated or tolerated high\u2011risk customers and regions, ignored red flags, and facilitated massive money laundering operations (Khanani\u2019s network, the Russian Laundromat, and the Global Laundromat) that turned criminal proceeds, including from the Syndicate\u2019s opium trade and other illicit activities, into U.S. dollars. They argue that, given longstanding public reporting and law\u2011enforcement scrutiny linking these money launderers and methods to terrorist financing, the banks knew or were willfully blind to the likelihood that their conduct was helping finance the Syndicate\u2019s terrorist operations, including the attacks against plaintiffs.",
          "On VAT fraud, plaintiffs assert that SCB and Deutsche Bank enabled Azizi\u2019s VAT fraud scheme by providing accounts, executing trades, and facilitating cross\u2011border transfers; Deutsche Bank did the same for Ahmed; and Danske Bank allowed Swefin to run large VAT frauds through its accounts. They argue the banks either knew or should have known, based on customer profiles (e.g., Azizi\u2019s youth and lack of visible means of support), the nature of the transactions (high\u2011volume phone purchases routed to Afghanistan, patterns typical of carousel fraud), internal compliance warnings, and publicly known links between VAT fraud and terrorist finance, that these schemes were part of Syndicate\u2011connected fundraising.",
          "Plaintiffs contend that JASTA and Halberstam do not require that the banks\u2019 assistance be directed to terrorist organizations or cells in their own names; assisting intermediaries that are closely tied to terrorist financing (such as well\u2011known money launderers and VAT fraudsters) suffices because JASTA allows liability for indirect aid and abetment. They argue that the district court improperly demanded a level of directness or specificity not required at the pleading stage.",
          "They further argue that their second cause of action based on aiding and abetting the broader \u2018Taliban\u2013al\u2011Qaeda Campaign\u2019 is consistent with JASTA, because the statute allows recovery for injuries arising from acts of international terrorism that form part of a larger pattern of racketeering. According to plaintiffs, defendants\u2019 pervasive and systemic assistance\u2014across fertilizer financing, money laundering, and VAT fraud\u2014constitutes aid to a campaign of terrorist violence, and Twitter leaves room for liability when a defendant pervasively and culpably plays a role in a broad scheme of wrongdoing.",

They argue that SCB did not bank any designated terrorist organization, did not participate in or facilitate the smuggling or bombmaking, and that continuing to provide routine services after government requests to reconsider those services amounts, at most, to nonfeasance, not the sort of affirmative, culpable conduct required under JASTA.",
          "Regarding money laundering, defendants maintain that plaintiffs impermissibly attempt to impose liability on the banks based on generalized allegations that some criminals and money launderers with possible ties to terrorism used the banks\u2019 services and that money is fungible. Defendants argue that this \u2018fungibility theory\u2019 is foreclosed by precedent (Linde, Honickman), which requires that aiding\u2011and\u2011abetting liability not be conflated with material\u2011support liability, and that plaintiffs fail to plead nonconclusory facts showing that the banks knew or intended that laundered funds would be used by the Syndicate for terrorist attacks.",

For SCB and the fertilizer companies, SCB provided ordinary banking services to lawful, non\u2011designated corporate customers, one percent of whose lawful product was allegedly diverted by third parties; SCB is not alleged to have banked the Syndicate, to have participated in smuggling or bombmaking, or to have directed its services toward terrorist activity. Even taking the Barbero meeting as true, at most it shows notice that diversion existed and that ceasing services might reduce risk\u2014nonfeasance, not \u2018knowing and substantial assistance\u2019 to particular attacks. For the money\u2011laundering and VAT\u2011fraud theories, plaintiffs rely on long and inferential causal chains: banks served entities involved in criminal schemes; some participants had alleged links to Syndicate\u2011related actors; some proceeds might have flowed to the Syndicate; and the Syndicate committed the attacks. That is precisely the attenuated, fungibility\u2011of\u2011money theory Twitter and Second Circuit cases reject. The complaint does not tie any defendant\u2019s specific services to any particular attack or to any particular operational cell, nor does it allege a pervasive, targeted, terrorism\u2011oriented financial relationship comparable to Kaplan or Honickman.

Much of the \u2018knowledge\u2019 is inferred from later public reports. VAT fraud: the banks are alleged to have seen indicators of tax fraud, not terrorism; connections to the Syndicate are entirely inferential, and there is no allegation of contemporaneous awareness that enabling VAT schemes meant playing a role in a terrorist campaign. Under Twitter and Second Circuit precedent, such allegations at most show reckless or negligent banking in high\u2011risk environments, not the required general awareness of participating in terrorist activities. The district court\u2019s conclusion that general awareness was not adequately pled is therefore affirmed."

The complaint\u2019s core money\u2011laundering and VAT\u2011fraud theories hinge on the idea that because funds are fungible, and because the Syndicate used laundered dollars and VAT\u2011fraud proceeds, the banks\u2019 processing of large volumes of suspicious transactions for criminal intermediaries necessarily constituted knowing and substantial assistance to the attacks. Linde and Honickman, reinforced by Twitter, make clear that JASTA aiding\u2011and\u2011abetting liability cannot be based solely on such fungibility reasoning or on provision of routine banking services to bad actors absent plausible allegations that the bank intended to, or knew it was, furthering terrorist activity. Here, the complaint does not allege that the banks directed funds to the Syndicate, that they structured their services to promote terrorist operations, or that they had contemporaneous notice that specific laundered or fraud proceeds were destined for the Syndicate\u2019s attacks. The attenuated chains (e.g., Russian Mafia buying opium from al\u2011Qaeda, then using Deutsche Bank mirror trades years later) are too remote and speculative to satisfy JASTA\u2019s causation and mental\u2011state requirements.

Twitter v. Taamneh, together with Second Circuit ATA precedents like Linde, Siegel, Honickman, and Kaplan, emphasize that JASTA requires \u2018truly culpable\u2019 participation in terrorist acts, not merely negligent or reckless banking for bad actors whose funds may, in part, support terrorism. The fertilizer allegations show at most nonfeasance toward lawful non\u2011FTO customers; the money\u2011laundering and VAT\u2011fraud allegations show knowledge of criminal or regulatory risk, not of participation in the Syndicate\u2019s violent campaign. The separate \u2018Taliban\u2013al\u2011Qaeda Campaign\u2019 theory conflicts with JASTA\u2019s focus on specific acts of international terrorism and is inadequately tied to discrete attacks.

      "factual_background":"On May 14, 2022, an 18-year-old white man drove to a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, intending to kill as many Black people as possible. He shot and killed ten Black victims and injured several others. In the subsequent investigation, the New York Attorney General issued an investigative report concluding that social media played a significant role in the attack. Investigators found that extremist memes and online content helped mainstream white supremacist extremism and influenced the shooter. His manifesto incorporated memes, in\u2011jokes, and slang associated with extremist websites and message boards, and investigators determined that he obtained advice online about how to carry out his attack, including information on acquiring weapons. During the attack, the shooter livestreamed the events on the Twitch platform. The livestream lasted about 24 minutes; the first 22 minutes showed him driving to the supermarket and the last two minutes depicted the beginning of the shooting. Twitch shut down the stream roughly two minutes after the violence began, following at least one user report. Between twenty and twenty\u2011eight Twitch users viewed some portion of the livestream while it was active. Despite Twitch\u2019s quick shutdown, graphic images and videos from the livestream spread on a fringe social media site in the days after the shooting.\n\nIn response to the Buffalo shooting and the perceived role of online platforms, the New York Legislature enacted New York General Business Law \u00a7 394\u2011ccc, known as the Hateful Conduct Law, effective December 3, 2022. The law applies to \"social media networks,\" defined as for\u2011profit service providers that operate internet platforms designed to enable users to share content with other users or to make such content available to the public. The law imposes two primary substantive requirements on covered entities:\n\n1. Policy Disclosure Requirement: Each social media network must have a clear and concise policy, readily available and accessible on its website and application, that includes how the network will respond to and address reports of incidents of hateful conduct on its platform.\n\n2. Report Mechanism Requirement: Each social media network conducting business in New York must provide and maintain a clear and easily accessible mechanism for individual users to report incidents of hateful conduct. The mechanism must be easily accessed from both the network\u2019s application and website and must allow the network to provide a direct response to any individual reporting hateful conduct, informing that person how the matter is being handled.\n\nThe statute defines \"hateful conduct\" as the use of a social media network to vilify, humiliate, or incite violence against a group or class of persons based on race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. The Attorney General is empowered to investigate and enforce the law and may seek civil penalties of up to $1,000 per day against a social media network that knowingly fails to comply. A savings clause states that the statute shall not be construed to impose obligations that adversely affect free speech rights under the First Amendment or to increase liability of a social media network for anything other than failing to provide a reporting mechanism and a response to such reports.\n\nThe plaintiffs are distinct online publishers or platforms. Eugene Volokh is a law professor who operates The Volokh Conspiracy, a legal blog oriented toward a free \"marketplace of ideas.\" The blog\u2019s posts and open forums garner dozens or hundreds of public comments; readers can respond to posts and to each other, and the State does not dispute that the site qualifies as a \"social media network\" under the statute due to its interactive, public commenting features. Volokh represents that some comments on his site express controversial views on topics related to the protected categories listed in \u00a7 394\u2011ccc(1)(a). He exercises full editorial control and contends that creating and maintaining the policies required by the statute would be burdensome and contrary to the blog\u2019s ethos and mission.\n\nRumble Canada Inc. operates \"Rumble,\" an online video\u2011sharing service similar to YouTube, where users upload videos, comment on videos, and reply to other comments, all visible to the public. Rumble describes its mission as protecting a free and open internet and being \"immune to cancel culture.\" Its existing terms prohibit content that is grossly offensive, including racism, antisemitism, and hatred, and bar content that supports or incites violence or unlawful acts or supports groups that do so. However, Rumble\u2019s complaint states that it does not prohibit content merely because it may \"vilify\" or \"humiliate\" others. Rumble has an email address for user complaints and attempts to respond but does not promise to inform complainants of any action taken.\n\nLocals Technology Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Rumble, operates \"Locals,\" a service that allows creators to upload content for paid or unpaid subscribers. Subscribers may comment and reply to comments. Locals describes itself as pro\u2011free\u2011speech and committed to fostering a safe, respectful community dedicated to free exchange of ideas. Its guidelines prohibit content that threatens violence against individuals or groups but otherwise allow users to \"independently police content.\" Locals maintains an email address for complaints but states that there is no requirement that it respond to those complaints.\n\nPlaintiffs assert that developing specific policies addressing \"hateful conduct\" as defined in the statute and implementing a dedicated reporting and response mechanism would be time\u2011consuming and burdensome, would conflict with their free\u2011speech\u2011oriented missions, and would affect how they curate or moderate user content, including controversial but protected speech.",

On December 6, 2022, they moved for a preliminary injunction. The complaint asserted five causes of action: (1) facial and as\u2011applied First Amendment challenges alleging that \u00a7 394\u2011ccc is an unconstitutional content\u2011 and viewpoint\u2011based regulation of speech; (2) facial and as\u2011applied First Amendment challenges alleging unconstitutional compelled speech; (3) facial and as\u2011applied First Amendment overbreadth challenges; (4) facial and as\u2011applied Fourteenth Amendment challenges alleging the law is void for vagueness; and (5) a claim that \u00a7 394\u2011ccc is preempted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230.",

It found that the statute compelled social media networks to engage in speech intertwined with protected speech and that the law was not narrowly tailored to a compelling interest. The district court also held that plaintiffs had shown a substantial likelihood of success on their facial First Amendment vagueness and overbreadth challenges, reasoning that the law\u2019s focus on \"hateful conduct\" could significantly chill social media users\u2019 protected speech and that key statutory terms such as \"vilify\" and \"humiliate\" were ambiguous. The court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 statutory preemption claim under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230, finding that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on that claim.

      "key_arguments":{
        "appellant_arguments":[
          "The Attorney General argues that the Policy Disclosure Requirement is properly viewed as a commercial disclosure regulation subject to Zauderer rather than strict scrutiny. In her view, the statute does not require platforms to adopt or even reference the statutory definition of 'hateful conduct' in their policies. Instead, it merely obliges them to disclose, in clear and concise terms, whatever their existing moderation practices are, including how they generally respond to user complaints. This, she contends, is a requirement to provide truthful, factual, and uncontroversial information about the terms on which services are available, reasonably related to a legitimate state interest in informing consumers and preventing deception.",
          "On the Policy Disclosure Requirement, the Attorney General maintains that social media networks retain full discretion over what moderation policies to adopt, including the option of having no formal policy and relying on case\u2011by\u2011case editorial judgment. She argues that a platform could lawfully comply with \u00a7 394\u2011ccc by disclosing a policy stating that it will respond to complaints in its own discretion, without committing to remove or treat any particular category of content, and without expressly tracking the statute\u2019s 'hateful conduct' definition.",
          "Regarding the Report Mechanism Requirement, the Attorney General contends that this provision regulates conduct rather than speech by requiring a technical mechanism for users to submit complaints. She asserts that the statute only requires that the mechanism allow the platform to respond but does not mandate that the platform actually provide a response or handle reports in any particular manner. She emphasizes the statute\u2019s savings clause, which states that the law should not be construed to add or increase liability for anything other than failure to provide a complaint mechanism and a response, and argues that the Attorney General cannot lawfully penalize platforms based on how they moderate specific content or on subjective disagreements with their moderation decisions.",
          "The Attorney General disputes the district court\u2019s facial vagueness and overbreadth analysis, arguing that the law does not impose penalties on social media users or require platforms to remove or punish users\u2019 speech deemed 'hateful conduct.' She contends that if the law is interpreted as a neutral disclosure and reporting requirement, it does not directly regulate or chill user speech, and any indirect effects on user behavior are too attenuated to support a facial invalidation. She also argues that any ambiguity in terms like 'vilify' and 'humiliate' is irrelevant if platforms are not required to adopt those terms in their policies.",
          "Alternatively, the Attorney General suggests that if Zauderer does not apply, the Policy Disclosure Requirement should still be analyzed as a regulation of commercial speech under intermediate scrutiny because it concerns the terms and conditions under which platforms offer services to users. She maintains that the law advances substantial governmental interests\u2014such as informing consumers about platforms\u2019 moderation practices and facilitating reports of dangerous content to reduce the risk of violence\u2014and is not overly restrictive. She does not contend that the statute satisfies strict scrutiny if interpreted as compelling platforms to align with the State\u2019s definition of 'hateful conduct.'",
          "The Attorney General challenges the breadth of the district court\u2019s injunction and argues that the court misapplied the preliminary\u2011injunction standard by treating the statute as necessarily compelling adoption of the 'hateful conduct' definition, rather than first considering whether a narrower, constitutionally permissible construction is available under New York law and the statute\u2019s own savings clause."
        ],
        "appellee_arguments":[
          "The plaintiffs argue that the most natural reading of \u00a7 394\u2011ccc is that it requires social media networks to develop and publish moderation policies that specifically address 'hateful conduct' as defined by the statute, and to create reporting mechanisms designed specifically for that category of content. They contend that the law thus compels them to adopt and publicly embrace the State\u2019s condemnation of online speech that 'vilif[ies]' or 'humiliate[s]' protected classes, not just unprotected incitement or threats, and to structure their moderation practices around those statutory categories.",
          "They maintain that the Policy Disclosure Requirement compels speech and is content\u2011 and viewpoint\u2011based. In their view, the requirement obliges them to speak about a controversial category of expressive content\u2014so\u2011called 'hateful conduct'\u2014and to do so using the State\u2019s framing, thereby forcing them to take a public position on what speech should be reported and potentially acted on. As platforms that seek to foster open debate and minimal moderation (particularly on politically and socially sensitive topics involving race, religion, gender, and other listed characteristics), they argue that having to craft and publish policies keyed to the statutory definition of 'hateful conduct' alters their editorial judgments and compels them to endorse the government\u2019s viewpoint about disfavored speech.",
          "With respect to the Report Mechanism Requirement, plaintiffs argue that the statute requires a dedicated mechanism for reporting 'hateful conduct' as the statute defines it, and that it obliges platforms to provide a direct response to those reports specifying how the matter is being handled. They contend that this compels them to highlight and legitimize the State\u2019s categories of disfavored expression and to engage in a government\u2011mandated dialogue with users about those categories, thereby compelling speech and altering their editorial practices.",
          "Plaintiffs assert that, even if framed as a disclosure rule, the law does not fit within Zauderer because the mandated disclosures concern controversial, value\u2011laden views about 'hate speech' and the appropriateness of moderating such content, rather than purely factual and uncontroversial information like prices or calorie counts. They argue that being forced to disclose how they will \"respond and address\" reports of 'hateful conduct' demands more than neutral, factual information; it requires an articulation of policies on contested issues of public concern, which is fully protected, noncommercial speech.",
          "They further argue that the law is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague on its face. In their view, terms like 'vilify' and 'humiliate' are elastic and subjective, which, coupled with the statute\u2019s focus on speech targeting protected classes, will cause users to self\u2011censor lawful but controversial expression for fear that it will be labeled 'hateful conduct' and flagged for special attention. Plaintiffs contend that, even though the statute does not directly penalize users or mandate content removal, its targeting of 'hateful conduct' for special reporting and policy treatment will reasonably lead users to fear government\u2011backed consequences, resulting in a substantial chilling effect on protected speech.",
          "Plaintiffs also argue that compliance will be burdensome and contrary to their missions. Volokh contends that drafting and maintaining the required policies, and creating processes to handle and respond to complaints framed in terms of 'hateful conduct,' would consume significant time and resources and would undermine the blog\u2019s commitment to open discourse. Rumble and Locals similarly argue that the statute would force them to change their moderation infrastructures and communications with users, interfering with their chosen editorial stance of allowing robust speech that may be offensive or controversial but is nonetheless protected, and requiring them to align their practices more closely with the State\u2019s disapproval of certain viewpoints.",
          "They maintain that, under the preliminary\u2011injunction standard, they have demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of their First Amendment claims\u2014both as\u2011applied and facial\u2014given the statute\u2019s focus on controversial speech categories, the compelled public articulation of policies about that speech, and the ambiguity and breadth of the 'hateful conduct' definition.

That reading fits the text (which focuses on requiring a \u2018policy\u2019 describing how they will respond to reports) and is reinforced by the savings clause disavowing any change to platforms\u2019 liability for user content. Under that construction, the law compels disclosure of how services are offered and moderated\u2014factual information about terms of service\u2014rather than compelling adoption of the State\u2019s viewpoint about hate speech. That kind of compelled disclosure is typically analyzed under Zauderer or at most intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny. The district court treated the statute as forcing platforms to embrace the State\u2019s definition of \u2018hateful conduct\u2019 and as a direct content-\/viewpoint-based speech mandate.

The provision requires that platforms offer a mechanism for users to submit complaints and that the mechanism allow the platform to respond; it does not require that the platform punish, remove, or even disapprove of the complained\u2011of content. Framed this way, it is primarily a technical and procedural requirement governing how a service is operated (a conduit for user reports), with at most an incidental effect on speech. The Attorney General stresses that no particular substantive response is mandated and that the only enforceable obligation is the existence of a mechanism and the capacity for response. That makes this far closer to regulation of conduct or, at worst, a disclosure about how complaints are processed, not a compelled, viewpoint\u2011laden dialogue. The district court\u2019s treatment of the mechanism as compelled speech rests on the same expansive reading the Attorney General disclaims. An appellate court is likely to hold that plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success in challenging this provision as unconstitutional compelled speech and will therefore reverse the injunction as to the reporting mechanism."

          "reasoning":"Facial vagueness and overbreadth are reviewed de novo. Those doctrines are especially disfavored where a narrowing construction can avoid constitutional problems. Under the State\u2019s interpretation, platforms are not required to adopt the statute\u2019s definition or to make moderation decisions by reference to \u2018vilify\u2019 or \u2018humiliate\u2019; they simply must state how they handle complaints about content users perceive in those terms. The civil penalty attaches only to failure to provide a policy and a mechanism, not to classifying or suppressing user speech. Because the statute neither criminalizes user speech nor directs platforms to remove such speech, the direct impact on user expression is attenuated. Ambiguity in the statutory definition of \u2018hateful conduct\u2019 thus becomes far less central: even if those adjectives are somewhat elastic, the law does not turn those terms into operative triggers for speech bans or civil liability for content decisions. The district court\u2019s facial overbreadth and vagueness holdings depended on reading the law as effectively regulating, and discouraging, \u2018hateful\u2019 user speech itself. An appellate court is likely to find that plaintiffs have not shown that the statute, as properly construed, prohibits or chills a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its narrow disclosure\/reporting function, nor that its terms are so indefinite as to bar enforcement. Accordingly, the facial vagueness and overbreadth rulings are likely reversed."

          "reasoning":"If the statute is construed narrowly so that it requires only neutral disclosure of existing moderation practices and a general user\u2011complaint mechanism\u2014without compelling platforms to adopt the statutory definition or to take a position on hate speech\u2014then the applicable standard is Zauderer. Under Zauderer, the State may require disclosure of factual, uncontroversial information about the terms on which services are offered, reasonably related to a legitimate interest, so long as the requirement is not unjustified or unduly burdensome. Here, the interest in informing users how platforms handle potentially harmful content and in facilitating reports is substantial and non\u2011ideological. The disclosures are about how the service operates, not about endorsing any norm; a platform may, for example, say that it accepts reports and ordinarily does nothing beyond logging them. That is factual information about service terms. The record does not show that creating or posting such descriptions, or adding a complaint link and the capability to respond, is so onerous as to be \u2018unduly burdensome\u2019 under Zauderer. To the extent the district court rejected application of Zauderer and concluded that plaintiffs were likely to prevail even under this narrower reading, that legal conclusion is unlikely to stand. The more plausible appellate resolution is to hold that, under a limiting construction, the statute fits within Zauderer and is likely valid. However, this point operates more as an alternative ground to reverse the preliminary injunction; to the extent the appellate court expressly reaches it, it would reject the district court\u2019s contrary view. Thus, on the specific question whether the provisions qualify under Zauderer and are justified and not unduly burdensome, the appellate court effectively affirms their validity and rejects plaintiffs\u2019 challenge."

The district court\u2019s likelihood\u2011of\u2011success analysis was premised on reading the statute as compelling platforms to adopt and implement the State\u2019s definition of \u2018hateful conduct\u2019 and on treating the law as a content\u2011 and viewpoint\u2011based regulation of speech triggering strict scrutiny, along with broad facial vagueness and overbreadth rulings. For the reasons above, an appellate court is likely to reject that legal framework, accept the narrower construction advanced by the Attorney General and supported by the savings clause, and conclude that plaintiffs have not clearly shown a likelihood of success on their primary constitutional theories. In First Amendment cases, likelihood of success is the dominant factor; where plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits, irreparable harm and public interest cannot justify a sweeping injunction against enforcement of a state statute. Consequently, the district court\u2019s decision to enjoin enforcement in its entirety will likely be deemed an abuse of discretion, and the preliminary injunction will be vacated or substantially narrowed."

      "overall_outcome":"REVERSE",
      "confidence":0.78,
      "reasoning":"The appeal turns on how broadly the statute is read and thus what level of First Amendment scrutiny applies. The Attorney General offers a narrowing interpretation under which the statute does not force platforms to adopt the statutory \u2018hateful conduct\u2019 definition, does not require any particular moderation decisions, and merely mandates (1) a public description of how platforms handle user complaints about certain content and (2) a mechanism through which complaints can be submitted and to which the platform is capable of responding. That construction is plausible in light of the text and the savings clause. Federal appellate courts generally prefer such limiting constructions where available to avoid striking down state statutes on facial First Amendment grounds. Under that framework, the Policy Disclosure Requirement is analyzed as a compelled commercial disclosure about service terms, and the Report Mechanism Requirement as regulation of conduct or, at most, a similar procedural requirement. Both are likely sustainable under Zauderer or intermediate scrutiny, and the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the requirements compel controversial, viewpoint\u2011laden speech become significantly weaker once it is clear that platforms may maintain permissive policies and need not echo the State\u2019s value judgments. Because the district court\u2019s broad preliminary injunction depends on a more expansive, viewpoint\u2011forcing interpretation, and because facial overbreadth and vagueness are disfavored where narrower readings exist, the appellate court is likely to conclude that plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. That means the district court abused its discretion in granting a sweeping preliminary injunction. The most probable appellate outcome is therefore to reverse the order granting the preliminary injunction and allow enforcement of the statute, possibly with guidance clarifying its limited reach under the First Amendment."

      },
      "factual_background":"Centura Health Corporation is a not\u2011for\u2011profit regional healthcare system headquartered in Colorado. St. Catherine Hospital (SCH) in Garden City, Kansas, is a Centura member hospital, and Centura manages SCH\u2019s clinical practices and personnel matters. Dr. Matthew Byrnes is a Kansas\u2011licensed physician (licensed by the Kansas Board of Healing Arts, KBHA). He worked at SCH as a general surgeon and intensivist from 2012 until February 12, 2020, and also served as SCH\u2019s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) from 2013 to June 2019. Centura and SCH jointly employed him.\n\nA number of SCH and Centura personnel played roles in the events: Dr. William Freund (President of SCH\u2019s Medical Executive Committee, MEC); Dr. Bryan Stucky (MEC Vice President and later President); Dr. Toni Green\u2011Cheatwood (Centura Colorado Kansas Group Vice President and Physician Executive); Peter Sabey (Centura General Counsel); Dr. Scott Lichtenberger (Centura President); Tom Gessel (Colorado Kansas Group President); Scott Taylor (SCH CEO); and Nancy Killion (Centura Director of Quality). Another SCH physician, Dr. Kurt Kessler, is central to the dispute, as are several other physicians (Drs. Julie Freeman, Gretchen Dunford, Zeferino Arroyo, James Zauche, Lionel Gottschalk, Joanne Rink, and others).\n\nIn April 2019, Drs. Freund, Kessler, Freeman, Dunford, and Arroyo met with CEO Scott Taylor and asked him to fire Dr. Byrnes. They based this request on their personal interactions with Dr. Byrnes and his interactions in the community. The record reflects that any concerns about patient care raised at that time were not substantiated by evidence. In June 2019, CEO Taylor removed Dr. Byrnes from the CMO position because his combined compensation for his three SCH roles might exceed regulatory compensation caps; Taylor testified this was not due to patient care issues.\n\nOn August 31, 2019, Dr. Byrnes submitted a written complaint about Dr. Kessler to Dr. Freund and Director of Quality Killion. He raised concerns about Dr. Kessler\u2019s clinical practices (such as a type of operation and failure to wear gloves during sensitive exams) and alleged that Dr. Kessler made sexually explicit comments and engaged in inappropriate touching of nurses. Dr. Byrnes stated he was relaying reports from at least two nurses who said they feared retaliation and therefore had not complained themselves. Dr. Freund showed Dr. Kessler the complaint and told him that Dr. Byrnes had filed it. Dr. Kessler later complained angrily to Killion and tried to speak with the HR director about the complaint in a manner the HR director considered \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nDr. Freund and the HR director each spoke with one nurse about Dr. Kessler. The nurse told Dr. Freund that Dr. Kessler had touched her in a way she characterized as \u201cweird and inappropriate.\u201d She did not recall the details of her conversation with HR, but the HR director reported that the nurse had said nothing inappropriate happened and that she was not uncomfortable. Dr. Freund substantiated allegations that Dr. Kessler had poor hand hygiene and located one nurse\u2019s note disagreeing with Dr. Kessler\u2019s patient care. Dr. Freund then met with the MEC and shared Dr. Byrnes\u2019s complaint, telling the MEC that he had investigated. There is a factual dispute over whether he described some or all of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s allegations as false. After the meeting, one MEC member, Dr. Dunford, emailed Dr. Green\u2011Cheatwood that all the allegations in Dr. Byrnes\u2019s complaint had been found false. Dr. Freund later forwarded Dr. Byrnes\u2019s complaint to Dr. Green\u2011Cheatwood.\n\nIn October 2019, Drs. Freund, Green\u2011Cheatwood, and Stucky told Dr. Byrnes that no merit had been found to any part of his complaint about Dr. Kessler and that it was dismissed in its entirety. Dr. Byrnes objected to the adequacy of the investigation and reiterated his concerns about Dr. Kessler. In November 2019, the MEC again discussed Dr. Byrnes\u2019s allegations and his insistence that he believed them to be true. Dr. Dunford expressed to Killion that Dr. Byrnes seemed very disturbed to write such a letter about a colleague.\n\nAlso in November 2019, SCH reappointed Dr. Byrnes to its medical staff. Under applicable bylaws, the department chair, MEC, and SCH Board consider factors including current competence, ability to safely and competently perform requested clinical privileges, commitment to quality care, ongoing professional practice evaluations and peer review, and verified complaints from patients or staff. As Chief of Surgery, Dr. Dunford certified, based on her review of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s education, training, experience, and current clinical competence, that he was qualified for staff membership and clinical privileges. The MEC and SCH Board approved his reappointment. CEO Taylor testified SCH would not have entered a new employment contract with Dr. Byrnes if it had concerns about his medical care.\n\nIn December 2019, Dr. Freund informed General Counsel Sabey that Dr. Byrnes had made what Freund characterized as false allegations against an SCH medical staff member. Freund signed an MEC letter to Dr. Byrnes requesting that he undergo a psychological evaluation; the letter said the MEC unanimously agreed this was in the hospital\u2019s and medical staff\u2019s best interest. On January 19, 2020, Dr. Byrnes emailed Dr. Stucky (now MEC President) asserting that Freund\u2019s letter was tantamount to retaliation against a whistleblower. He reiterated his complaints about Dr. Kessler, defended their validity, and stated he had obtained or was obtaining letters from medical and nursing personnel to support his allegations. He demanded that the MEC retract the evaluation request. Dr. Stucky forwarded this letter to Sabey. Two days later, Stucky emailed Dr. Byrnes that the MEC would retract the psychological evaluation request.\n\nOn January 27, 2020, SCH received a KBHA subpoena regarding an anonymous complaint against Dr. Byrnes. The complaint alleged multiple alarming adverse outcomes including patient deaths; that Dr. Byrnes pressured CEO Taylor to disband the hospital peer review committee; that he had an unusually high number of nicked bowels during surgery; that he abandoned eight ICU cases; that he transferred out patients he had dangerously mismanaged; and that there were well\u2011known incidents of sexual relations in hospital treatment rooms with nurses. It further stated that the medical staff had told the CEO that Dr. Byrnes was unsafe and needed an assessment due to erratic behavior and dangerous violations of the standard of care. According to CEO Taylor and others, there was a general perception at SCH that Dr. Kessler had filed this anonymous complaint in retaliation for Dr. Byrnes\u2019s earlier complaint.\n\nOn January 30, 2020, Dr. Byrnes called Dr. Green\u2011Cheatwood to report receipt of the KBHA complaint and subpoena. He asserted that Dr. Kessler had filed it in retaliation, denied the substantive allegations, and cited his mortality statistics, experience, and litigation history to refute claims of unsafe practice. He said much of the medical staff would support him and refute the allegations.\n\nThat same day, Green\u2011Cheatwood emailed Sabey summarizing the eight\u2011minute call, and Sabey initiated an internal investigation. On February 6, 2020, Green\u2011Cheatwood and Sabey traveled to SCH and, in one day, interviewed CEO Taylor, CFO Amanda Vaughan, Killion, Drs. Babigumira, Arroyo, Freeman, Dunford, Stucky, Freund, Kessler, and Zauche. Dr. Freeman said she had seen Dr. Byrnes purchasing to\u2011go beer when she thought he was on ICU call, though she did not know if he had arranged coverage. Dr. Dunford said communication with Dr. Byrnes about coverage was imperfect, but that their patients were always covered and no patient care issues resulted. Drs. Kessler and Freund said that as CMO, Dr. Byrnes had disbanded SCH\u2019s peer review committee. Although SCH procedures and HR best practices call for interviewing the subject of an investigation, Green\u2011Cheatwood and Sabey did not notify or interview Dr. Byrnes, nor did they interview nurses. Green\u2011Cheatwood later explained that Dr. Byrnes was out of town and represented by counsel, though the record shows they coordinated schedules with other physicians and interviewed Dr. Kessler in his lawyer\u2019s presence.\n\nOn February 10, 2020, Green\u2011Cheatwood and Sabey telephoned Centura President Lichtenberger and Group President Gessel, reported their investigation results, and recommended firing Dr. Byrnes. Lichtenberger stated he based his decision on their report. Gessel did not recall the details of the decision but believed Green\u2011Cheatwood and Sabey supported termination. On February 12, 2020, Green\u2011Cheatwood and Dr. Zauche informed Dr. Byrnes in person that he was terminated and provided him a letter from Lichtenberger stating he was terminated without cause. Dr. Byrnes\u2019s employment agreement allowed either party to terminate the agreement for any reason or no reason on 90 days\u2019 notice.\n\nOn May 1, 2020, Dr. Byrnes filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) challenging his termination. The Defendants responded that they terminated him due to concerns about his patient care and his having halted the peer review process while CMO, asserting he had inappropriately shut down normal peer review that would have identified deficiencies and led to loss of his clinical privileges.\n\nThe KBHA conducted its own investigation into the anonymous complaint about Dr. Byrnes, allowed him to respond to the allegations, and on September 21, 2021, closed the complaint without taking action. Separately, on January 29, 2020, before his firing, Dr. Green\u2011Cheatwood proposed a new case review process under which SCH cases that met certain criteria would be sent to other Centura facilities with robust peer review committees. Initially, this proposal contemplated reviewing SCH charts from the prior two years for all physicians. After Dr. Byrnes\u2019s January 30 call, however, she proposed that Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases from the prior five years be reviewed using somewhat different selection criteria.\n\nUnder this process, Quality Improvement Coordinator O\u2019re Berry at St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital (a Centura facility in Colorado) screened SCH charts based on criteria such as complications, returns to surgery, and mortalities, then sent flagged cases to Dr. Stucky, who decided which to submit for outside peer review, relying on Green\u2011Cheatwood\u2019s recommendations for surgical cases. Outside peer review committees at two Centura hospitals, including a committee at St. Anthony\u2019s led by Dr. Rebecca Vogel, reviewed the cases, applied Kansas\u2019s four\u2011level standard\u2011of\u2011care (SOC) rubric (SOC 1\u20134), and assigned ratings. SOC 3 and SOC 4 determinations are reportable to the KBHA under Kansas regulations. St. Anthony\u2019s peer review process was designed to be anonymous, but Green\u2011Cheatwood asked Dr. Vogel to perform a personal, non\u2011anonymous review of at least one Dr. Byrnes case, identifying him by name.\n\nAfter the committees returned their SOC assessments and comments to SCH, SCH\u2014principally through Dr. Stucky and relevant quality\/risk committees\u2014reviewed the adverse findings and determined what action to take. The general approach was that mandatory\u2011report cases (SOC 3 or 4) would be reported to the KBHA, while in some instances SCH might pursue remediation or collegial intervention with the physician instead of reporting.\n\nSCH ultimately reported four of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases to the KBHA: one case on September 28, 2020, and three cases on January 12, 2021. The first was a 2015 thyroidectomy in which an outside peer reviewer noted \u201cminor improvement opportunities\u201d for Dr. Byrnes. The record, viewed in Dr. Byrnes\u2019s favor, permits an inference that this case was not a mandatory\u2011report SOC 3 or 4 matter, that no explicit SOC rating was documented, and that the nerve damage sustained was a known complication rather than an unambiguous \u201cinjury\u201d in regulatory terms. Dr. Byrnes\u2019s co\u2011surgeon on that case, Dr. Joanne Rink, was not reported to the KBHA.\n\nWhen Dr. Stucky referred Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases for review, he also referred multiple cases involving another surgeon, Dr. Lionel Gottschalk. The St. Anthony\u2019s committee identified three Gottschalk cases as having \u201csignificant\u201d improvement opportunities that Dr. Vogel stated could be SOC 3 or SOC 4 and therefore reportable. SCH, however, allowed Dr. Gottschalk to respond to those adverse findings, and after his response the internal SCH committee re\u2011rated these cases as SOC 2, which are not mandatorily reportable. The record is disputed as to whether any of Gottschalk\u2019s SOC 2 cases were ultimately reported; taking the evidence favorably to Dr. Byrnes, the jury could find that none of those SOC 2 cases were reported.\n\nBerry also initially screened some cases involving Dr. Rink, another former SCH surgeon, but the record does not clearly show whether any of her cases were sent for external peer review. It is undisputed that none of Dr. Rink\u2019s cases, including the 2015 thyroidectomy performed with Dr. Byrnes, were reported to the KBHA. In January 2021, SCH reported four physicians to the KBHA\u2014Drs. Byrnes (three cases), Kessler (one), Morren (one), and Strandmark (one). SCH\u2019s Director of Quality and Patient Safety testified that the initial report for Dr. Strandmark was a mistake and should have been made regarding a different physician, Dr. Gottschalk; SCH then corrected the error and resubmitted the report naming Gottschalk. The record does not clarify the SOC level for that reported Gottschalk case.\n\nThe KBHA opened investigations into the four Byrnes cases reported by SCH and, on August 3, 2022, closed all of them. For three of the cases, KBHA reviewers recommended that Dr. Byrnes\u2019s treatment adhered to the applicable standard of care; the fourth was closed without action.\n\nThroughout this period, SCH and Centura personnel understood that reporting a physician to the KBHA was a serious matter because the KBHA regulates medical licensure in Kansas and has authority to revoke, suspend, or limit a physician\u2019s license. The reporting of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases occurred months after his termination and after his EEOC charge had been filed.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Dr. Byrnes filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. He brought federal retaliation claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against St. Catherine Hospital and Centura Health Corporation, alleging (1) that his employment was terminated in retaliation for his reporting alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Kessler, and (2) that the Defendants unfairly subjected his cases to peer review and reported four of them to the Kansas Board of Healing Arts in retaliation for the same protected activity. He also asserted federal claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (later not pursued on appeal) and various related state\u2011law claims.",
        "district_court_decision":"The Defendants moved for summary judgment. On the Title VII termination\u2011based retaliation claim, the district court applied the McDonnell Douglas burden\u2011shifting framework. It held that Dr. Byrnes had engaged in protected activity and suffered a materially adverse action (termination), but that the causal connection element required him to show that the decisionmakers who terminated him (Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel) knew of his protected activity, or alternatively to proceed under a 'cat\u2019s paw' theory by showing that biased subordinates caused an adverse decision. The court assumed without deciding that Dr. Byrnes could show the first cat\u2019s\u2011paw element (biased subordinate action), and found sufficient evidence on intent and proximate cause to move to McDonnell Douglas step two. It then concluded that Defendants had articulated four legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for terminating Dr. Byrnes: alleged abandonment of ICU patients, poor documentation of patient status, potentially poor clinical judgment, and his having stopped some peer review components as CMO. At the pretext stage, the court rejected Dr. Byrnes\u2019s arguments that Defendants\u2019 reasons were inconsistent or uncorroborated, that temporal proximity between his renewed sexual\u2011harassment complaints and his termination indicated pretext, that the investigation into his conduct was biased or unfair, and that Defendants deviated from normal policies. The court determined he had not shown a genuine dispute of material fact as to pretext and granted summary judgment to Defendants on the termination retaliation claim.\n\nOn the Title VII claim based on Defendants\u2019 reporting of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases to the KBHA, the district court again applied McDonnell Douglas, finding that Dr. Byrnes\u2019s protected activity and the report to the licensing board were undisputed, but that he failed to establish the causal\u2011connection element of his prima facie case. The court concluded that the outside peer review committees, which it found had no knowledge of his protected activity, were the relevant decisionmakers, and it rejected Dr. Byrnes\u2019s theory that Drs. Stucky and Green\u2011Cheatwood were the actual decisionmakers or biased subordinates under a cat\u2019s paw theory. It also found insufficient his reliance on Dr. Green\u2011Cheatwood\u2019s disclosure of his identity to one peer review chair to establish causation. Because it found he had not shown causation at step one, the court did not proceed to steps two or three of McDonnell Douglas on this claim and granted summary judgment to Defendants on the report\u2011to\u2011KBHA retaliation claim.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Dr. Byrnes\u2019s federal Title VII and ADA claims. Having dismissed all claims over which it had original federal jurisdiction, the court then declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Dr. Byrnes\u2019s remaining state\u2011law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).",
        "what_is_appealed":"Dr. Byrnes timely appealed. On appeal he challenges (1) the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants on his Title VII retaliation claim arising from his termination; (2) the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his Title VII retaliation claim based on Defendants\u2019 peer review and reporting of four of his cases to the Kansas Board of Healing Arts; and (3) the district court\u2019s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over his state\u2011law claims following dismissal of his federal claims."

A plaintiff may prove retaliation using either direct evidence of retaliatory motive or the McDonnell Douglas burden\u2011shifting framework. Under McDonnell Douglas, the plaintiff must first make a prima facie case of retaliation by showing (1) protected opposition to discrimination, (2) a materially adverse action, and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action, see Bekkem v. Wilkie, 915 F.3d 1258, 1267 (10th Cir. 2019. If the plaintiff does so, the employer must articulate a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its decision. The burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show a genuine dispute of material fact that the employer\u2019s reason is pretextual. For Title VII retaliation claims, the adverse action standard is whether the action would dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination, and the causation standard is but\u2011for causation. Under cat\u2019s paw theory, an employer may be liable if a biased subordinate performs a deliberate act motivated by retaliatory animus that is intended to cause and is a but\u2011for cause of the materially adverse action, even if the final decisionmaker is ostensibly unbiased, see EEOC v. BCI Coca\u2011Cola Bottling Co. of L.A., 450 F.3d 476 (10th Cir. 2006); Thomas v. Berry Plastics Corp., 803 F.3d 510, 516 n.8 (10th Cir. 2015)."

He contends that his termination approximately three weeks after his January 19, 2020 whistleblower letter, and within months of his initial August 31, 2019 complaint, supports a causal connection. He argues that, under a cat\u2019s paw theory, Dr. Green\u2011Cheatwood and General Counsel Sabey harbored retaliatory animus because they knew of his protected complaints, treated them as false, and then conducted a one\u2011sided investigation into the anonymous KBHA complaint that excluded him and favored information detrimental to him while ignoring or failing to develop contrary evidence.\",      \"He further argues that Green\u2011Cheatwood and Sabey intended their investigative actions and their recommendation to result in his termination, and that their report was the but\u2011for cause of the termination because Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel relied exclusively or uncritically on their account without conducting an independent investigation or speaking with him. He emphasizes that best practices and SCH procedures called for interviewing the subject of the investigation and relevant nurses; nonetheless, they interviewed only physicians (including alleged antagonists) and did not pursue leads that could exculpate him or clarify disputed factual matters, such as coverage arrangements while he was out of town.\",      \"On pretext, Dr. Byrnes contends that Defendants\u2019 articulated reasons for his firing\u2014patient abandonment, poor documentation, poor clinical judgment, and halting peer review\u2014are inconsistent across various decisionmakers and uncorroborated when the record is viewed in his favor. He highlights undisputed evidence that he was reappointed to the medical staff and granted a new contract in November 2019 with positive competence assessments, which he argues undercuts later claims of unsafe practice. He also argues that prior complaints about his care emerged only after, and in reaction to, his protected activity, and that the April 2019 meeting did not establish substantiated quality\u2011of\u2011care issues.\",      \"Dr. Byrnes also claims temporal proximity between his most recent protected activity (the January 19 whistleblower letter) and his February 12 termination as supporting an inference of retaliation when combined with the allegedly unfair investigation. He maintains that deviations from standard investigative procedures (failure to interview him or nurses, reliance on hearsay or ambiguous statements, and assumption about his role in peer review) further evidence pretext.\",      \"On the report\u2011to\u2011KBHA retaliation claim, Dr. Byrnes argues that SCH\u2014through Drs. Stucky and Green\u2011Cheatwood and SCH\u2019s risk\/quality committees\u2014rather than the outside peer review committees, actually took the adverse action of reporting his cases to the KBHA. He notes that Stucky selected which cases to send for outside review, participated in internal committees reviewing adverse findings, and decided which cases to report versus handle through remediation. He contends that both Stucky and Green\u2011Cheatwood knew of his protected activity and continued to harbor concerns about his complaint against Dr. Kessler.\",      \"He further asserts that Defendants adopted and applied peer review and reporting processes to him in a retaliatory way, including: expanding the temporal scope and criteria of the review only for his cases (five years vs. two years for others); asking for a personalized, non\u2011anonymous review of at least one of his cases and revealing his identity to the outside reviewer; and selecting his cases for reporting even where the SOC status and injury elements were ambiguous. He relies on comparative evidence, arguing that similarly situated physicians\u2014Drs. Gottschalk and Rink\u2014were treated more favorably. Gottschalk allegedly received internal downgrades of several cases initially flagged as reportable SOC 3\/4 and was allowed to respond before SCH decided not to report the cases. Rink, his co\u2011surgeon on the 2015 thyroidectomy, was not reported at all on that case. By contrast, Dr. Byrnes was not invited to respond to adverse peer review findings, and SCH reported at least one of his cases (the 2015 thyroidectomy) even though it was arguably not mandatorily reportable.\",      \"Dr. Byrnes maintains that this differential treatment and the reporting of a non\u2011mandatory case show that Defendants\u2019 explanation\u2014that they reported only SOC 3 and 4 cases as required by law\u2014is pretextual and that retaliatory motive more likely explains why his cases were treated more harshly than those of colleagues who had not engaged in protected activity.\",      \"With respect to supplemental jurisdiction, Dr. Byrnes argues that because his federal Title VII claims should not have been dismissed at summary judgment, it was improper for the district court to rely on the dismissal of those claims as the basis for declining supplemental jurisdiction over his state\u2011law causes of action.\"    ],    \"appellee_arguments\": [      \"On the termination retaliation claim, St. Catherine Hospital and Centura Health argue that Dr. Byrnes cannot establish the required causal connection between his protected activity and his termination. They assert that the final decisionmakers\u2014Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel\u2014did not know about Dr. Byrnes\u2019s sexual\u2011harassment complaint against Dr. Kessler or his subsequent whistleblower communications, and that the record fails to show the knowledge element necessary for retaliation. They further contend that Dr. Byrnes\u2019s reliance on a cat\u2019s paw theory is misplaced because there is insufficient evidence that any subordinate involved in the investigation acted with retaliatory animus or that any such animus was a but\u2011for cause of the termination.\",      \"Defendants maintain that they conducted a reasonable internal investigation into serious patient\u2011care and professional\u2011conduct allegations arising from the anonymous KBHA complaint and that they were entitled to rely on that investigation. They note that Dr. Byrnes had an opportunity during his January 30, 2020 call with Dr. Green\u2011Cheatwood to deny the allegations and present his own data and explanations, and argue that he was therefore not deprived of a chance to be heard. They contend that there was no requirement to interview him again or to interview nurses as part of the internal inquiry, that HR 'best practices' are not legally mandated, and that focusing interviews on physicians made sense because they were best positioned to identify clinical issues.\",      \"On pretext, Defendants assert that their reasons for terminating Dr. Byrnes are consistent: multiple witnesses raised concerns about his patient care before his August 2019 complaint about Dr. Kessler; there was evidence he abandoned patients, failed to document adequately, exercised poor judgment, and altered or halted components of the peer review process as CMO. They argue that different spokespersons may have emphasized different reasons, but that does not amount to inconsistency or dishonesty. They also argue that temporal proximity alone is insufficient to demonstrate pretext and that the timeline is explained by the occurrence of the anonymous KBHA complaint and subsequent investigation, rather than by his protected activity.\",      \"Regarding the report\u2011to\u2011KBHA claim, Defendants argue that Dr. Byrnes cannot establish the causation element of his prima facie case. They contend that the adverse reporting decisions were made by independent outside peer review committees applying Kansas\u2019s SOC standards, and that these committees operated without knowledge of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s protected activity. They characterize Drs. Stucky and Green\u2011Cheatwood as merely influencing which cases were submitted for review, not as the ultimate decisionmakers regarding SOC levels or reportability, and argue that such influence is insufficient to establish causation or cat\u2019s paw liability because the external committees independently determined which cases constituted SOC 3 or 4.\",      \"Defendants further assert that the peer review and reporting process for Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases followed an objective, mandatory reporting regime under Kansas regulations. They state that all four of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases that were reported had been classified as SOC 3 or SOC 4 by the external reviewers, triggering mandatory reporting obligations to the KBHA. They dispute that internal differences in how other physicians\u2019 cases were handled demonstrate retaliation, explaining that peer review outcomes and SOC ratings can legitimately differ depending on the facts of each case and the remedial options available, including whether the physician remains on staff. They emphasize that Dr. Gottschalk\u2019s cases were ultimately rated SOC 2 after further review, and that they corrected one reporting error by reassigning a report initially made in Dr. Strandmark\u2019s name to Dr. Gottschalk, demonstrating good\u2011faith efforts to comply with reporting rules.\",      \"Defendants maintain that there is no evidence they singled out Dr. Byrnes for harsher treatment because of his sexual\u2011harassment complaints or EEOC charge; instead, any differences in the handling of cases were due to clinical judgments, employment status, and regulatory obligations. They argue that revealing Dr. Byrnes\u2019s identity to Dr. Vogel for a 'personal' review did not taint the committee process or establish a retaliatory motive.\",      \"On supplemental jurisdiction, Defendants contend that once the district court properly granted summary judgment on all federal claims, it acted within its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state\u2011law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).\"    ]  } }```Note: The JSON above preserves only the factual, procedural, issue, standard, and argument descriptions as required, and omits any statement of how the appellate court resolved these issues.```"

          "reasoning":"Summary judgment on the termination\u2011based retaliation claim is reviewed de novo. Viewing the record favorably to Dr. Byrnes, there is substantial evidence from which a jury could find both cat\u2019s\u2011paw causation and pretext. Green\u2011Cheatwood and Sabey knew of his sexual\u2011harassment complaints (including the January 19 whistleblower email expressly accusing retaliation), characterized his allegations as false, and then conducted a rushed, one\u2011sided investigation of the anonymous KBHA complaint that excluded him and all nurses, focused on physicians including those antagonistic to him, and deviated from usual procedures that called for interviewing the subject. They then recommended termination, and Lichtenberger expressly relied on their report without any independent inquiry. That is classic cat\u2019s\u2011paw evidence of intent and but\u2011for causation sufficient to get to a jury. \n\nAt the pretext stage, a factfinder could reasonably doubt Defendants\u2019 four articulated reasons: (1) SCH had just reappointed him and entered a new contract in November 2019 based on affirmatively positive competence findings, undermining claims of longstanding unsafe practice; (2) the April 2019 \u201cconcerns\u201d were largely interpersonal and were not substantiated quality\u2011of\u2011care problems; (3) there is record support that his role in allegedly \u2018stopping\u2019 peer review was mischaracterized; and (4) the investigation into the anonymous complaint was narrow and selectively corroborated only negative views. Temporal proximity\u2014less than a month between his January 19 whistleblower letter and February 12 termination\u2014combined with the suspect investigation and procedural deviations is enough for a reasonable jury to infer retaliation. Under de novo review, these disputes should preclude summary judgment. Accordingly, the panel is likely to reverse as to the termination\u2011based Title VII retaliation claim."

          "reasoning":"Summary judgment on the report\u2011to\u2011KBHA retaliation claim is also reviewed de novo. The district court resolved the case at the prima facie stage, treating the external peer\u2011review committees as the exclusive decisionmakers and concluding they lacked knowledge of the protected activity. But the adverse action under Title VII here is not the technical SOC score; it is SCH\u2019s ultimate choice to report (or not report) specific cases to the KBHA and how it structured and applied the review process. The undisputed facts show that SCH, through Stucky, Green\u2011Cheatwood, and its internal committees, (a) selected Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases for a broadened, five\u2011year review with different criteria than the initially proposed two\u2011year, all\u2011physician review, (b) controlled which flagged cases went forward, (c) decided what weight to give the external SOC ratings, and (d) made the final decisions about whether to report or instead handle matters through remediation or collegial intervention. Those internal actors concededly knew of his protected activity. That suffices for the knowledge and \u2018decisionmaker\u2019 elements at the prima facie stage; the outside committees were, at most, advisors. \n\nAdditionally, there is substantial circumstantial evidence from which a jury could infer retaliatory motive and pretext: (1) he was the only physician whose review window was expanded to five years and whose selection criteria were altered after his protected January 30 call; (2) Green\u2011Cheatwood asked Dr. Vogel for a special non\u2011anonymous review of at least one of his cases, identifying him by name contrary to the anonymous design of the process; (3) SCH reported a thyroidectomy case that, viewed favorably to Byrnes, was not clearly a mandatory SOC\u20113\/4 \u2018injury\u2019 and involved a co\u2011surgeon (Rink) whom SCH did not report; and (4) similarly situated physicians, particularly Gottschalk, had multiple adverse cases initially described as potentially SOC 3\/4 but, after being given a chance to respond, had them internally downgraded to SOC 2 and, inferably, not reported. Byrnes was not afforded a similar opportunity to respond to adverse findings. \n\nThese disparities, tied directly to actors aware of his protected activity, could lead a reasonable jury to infer that SCH\u2019s stated explanation\u2014that it simply followed mandatory reporting rules\u2014was not the whole story. At a minimum, the causation element of the prima facie case is satisfied, and there is enough evidence of differential treatment and irregularities to require a step\u2011three pretext analysis by a jury, not resolution as a matter of law. The district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment on this claim, and reversal is likely."

The court\u2019s discretion to decline jurisdiction arose only because it had dismissed all federal claims. If, as predicted, the appellate court reverses the grants of summary judgment on one or both Title VII retaliation claims, then the predicate for invoking \u00a7 1367(c)(3) no longer exists. In that posture, the judgment dismissing the state\u2011law claims for lack of supplemental jurisdiction cannot stand and must be vacated or reversed so the state claims may proceed alongside the reinstated federal claims.

      "reasoning":"The record contains multiple indicators that summary judgment was premature on both Title VII retaliation theories. For the termination claim, strong temporal proximity, evidence that key subordinates with knowledge of and hostility toward Byrnes\u2019s protected activity shaped a skewed investigation, and the hospital\u2019s own recent positive reappointment and contract renewal together create a classic jury\u2011question on cat\u2019s\u2011paw causation and pretext. For the KBHA\u2011reporting claim, the district court\u2019s characterization of the outside peer\u2011review committees as the sole decisionmakers understates SCH\u2019s control and discretion: Stucky and Green\u2011Cheatwood decided which cases to send, how broadly to review Byrnes\u2019s history, and whether to report versus remediate, and they apparently treated Byrnes less favorably than similarly situated colleagues. These are precisely the kinds of factual disputes about intent, comparative treatment, and the meaning of procedural deviations that courts of appeals frequently find inappropriate for resolution on summary judgment in retaliation cases. Once at least one federal claim is reinstated, the \u00a7 1367(c)(3) ground for declining supplemental jurisdiction disappears, so the state\u2011law claims return as well. Accordingly, the likely overall outcome is reversal and remand for trial (or further proceedings) on both federal claims and reinstatement of supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims."

      "factual_background":"In the early morning hours of February 22, 2021, shortly after 1:00 a.m., Brandon Velez was driving from a convenience store back to his apartment in Manchester, New Hampshire. While on patrol in a marked cruiser, Manchester police officers Rachael Eutzy and Erik Slocum observed that Velez\u2019s vehicle had a broken headlight. They made a U-turn and followed him, noticing as they did so that his vehicle also had a broken taillight. As they followed, Velez accelerated, turned left, and then made another left. The officers viewed these maneuvers as an attempt to elude them. Shortly thereafter, Velez pulled into his usual parking spot near where the officers had first seen him and turned off the engine. Velez denies any attempt to evade the officers and asserts that he did not see the cruiser\u2019s blue lights\u2014activated while he was turning off the main road\u2014until after he was already parked.\n\nOfficer Slocum later stated in an affidavit that the address where Velez parked was associated in the past with drugs and prostitution. After Velez parked, Officers Eutzy and Slocum exited their cruiser and approached his vehicle. Velez was seated in the driver\u2019s seat with both hands raised. According to Velez, he had not rolled down his window because it was not functioning.\n\nOfficer Eutzy, in full department uniform with badge and insignia, approached the driver\u2019s side and greeted Velez with, \u201cHey, how we doing?\u201d She then opened the driver\u2019s side door. Velez objected, asking why she was opening his door and stating that he lived there and that the action was disrespectful. When he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to open my door just like that,\u201d Eutzy\u2019s tone became stern, and she instructed him to stop talking. Velez replied, \u201cOkay, hold up,\u201d and reached into his left pocket to retrieve what turned out to be a cell phone. Immediately, Eutzy ordered him to remove his hands from his pockets and told him to \u201chop out\u201d of the vehicle.\n\nVelez did not comply. He responded, \u201cNo. No. You can\u2019t, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d At that point, Eutzy grabbed his arm and began pulling him out of the car. Velez resisted and began shouting, asking why the officers were doing this and emphasizing that they had not told him why he had been pulled over.\n\nBy then, Slocum had moved to the driver\u2019s side. He grabbed Velez around the neck area and told him to \u201cget out of the fucking car.\u201d Velez continued to resist. A physical struggle ensued, during which Slocum told Velez to get out of the car and advised him that he was under arrest. Velez resisted leaving the car, shouted for help, and appeared to brace himself against the car frame as the officers continued pulling on him. Slocum then struck Velez twice in the abdomen and twice in the head and deployed a Taser against him twice. After the second Taser deployment, the officers succeeded in pulling Velez from the car and taking him to the ground, where they attempted to handcuff him.\n\nA third officer arrived while Velez was on the ground. Eutzy ordered Velez to stop fighting, and the third officer told him to get on his stomach, using an insult. Velez responded that he was not fighting and repeatedly shouted that he could not breathe. The officers handcuffed his hands behind his back and brought him to a standing position. At this point, a total of seven officers were present at the scene. Slocum asked Velez his name, and the group of officers escorted him to a police car.\n\nVelez was taken to the police station and charged with two misdemeanors and a traffic violation. He ultimately pleaded guilty to the traffic violation, and the misdemeanor charges were dropped. Velez alleges he sustained injuries from the force used during the removal from the car, the strikes, Taser deployments, and the takedown and handcuffing.",

        "claims_brought":"On December 9, 2022, Velez filed suit in New Hampshire state court against the City of Manchester and several of its police officers, including Officers Eutzy, Slocum, and another on-scene officer, Casey Seigle. He asserted multiple federal and state common-law claims. The federal claims included, among others, a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for wrongful arrest (lack of probable cause), a \u00a7 1983 claim for retaliatory arrest allegedly based on his verbal protests and attempt to use a cell phone, and a \u00a7 1983 claim for excessive force under the Fourth Amendment. He also brought related state-law claims, including false imprisonment under New Hampshire law, and a common-law assault-and-battery claim based on the force used. In addition, he asserted claims against the City premised on municipal liability theories, including alleged failure to train officers adequately with respect to the use of force and to officers\u2019 response to First Amendment\u2013protected conduct, as well as analogous negligence-based failure-to-train claims under New Hampshire law.",

In doing so, the court concluded that the officers had probable cause to arrest Velez, which defeated his wrongful-arrest claim under \u00a7 1983 and his state-law false-imprisonment claim; that the existence of probable cause also undermined his retaliatory-arrest theory; that no reasonable jury could find that the officers\u2019 use of force was excessive under the Fourth Amendment or unreasonable under state assault-and-battery law; and that Velez had not met the requirements to impose municipal liability or failure-to-train liability on the City under either federal or state law.",

A single incident is ordinarily insufficient to establish a policy or custom, absent additional evidence of a widespread practice. Under New Hampshire law, a failure-to-train claim sounds in negligence and turns on whether officers were incompetent, inexperienced, or unskilled in a way that posed a known or foreseeable risk of harm to the public, and whether the municipality knew or should have known of that risk based on prior information and training history."

          "On probable cause and wrongful arrest\/false imprisonment, Velez argues that when Officer Eutzy first grabbed his arm, he had not yet physically resisted, so there was no basis to conclude he was committing the misdemeanor of resisting arrest or detention under RSA 642:2. He contends that his initial conduct amounted only to verbal objection and a nonthreatening movement to retrieve his phone, which should not qualify as resisting. He maintains that treating the officers\u2019 immediate physical use of force to effect what he characterizes as an arrest as creating probable cause for resisting would improperly bootstrap the officers\u2019 own actions into justification for the arrest.",
          "On retaliatory arrest, Velez contends that his verbal protests about the officer opening his car door and his attempt to retrieve his phone were protected by the First Amendment, and that the officers\u2019 rapid resort to force and the arrest were motivated, at least in substantial part, by his protests and attempt to document the encounter. He asserts that he was arrested because he asserted his rights and questioned the officers\u2019 conduct, and that his conduct did not otherwise provide a legitimate basis for arrest.",
          "On excessive force and assault and battery, Velez maintains that the force used by the officers, particularly by Slocum, was disproportionate to the circumstances. He emphasizes that the underlying offense prompting the stop was a minor traffic equipment violation; that he was seated in a parked, turned-off vehicle; that he posed no immediate threat, had no weapon, and made no threats; and that his resistance, if any, was limited to bracing himself in the vehicle and not complying with orders. He argues that the escalation from verbal commands to grabbing, to neck yanking, multiple body and head strikes, and two Taser deployments within less than a minute was unreasonable and contrary to the requirement to use the least force necessary.",
          "On qualified immunity, Velez contends that existing case law, including Raiche v. Pietroski and Alexis v. McDonald's Restaurants of Massachusetts, clearly established that using significant force (violent tackling, forceful pulling, and dragging) against nonviolent, minimally resisting or non-resisting individuals in low-level offense situations is unconstitutional. He argues that those precedents, together with the general Graham v. Connor standards, made it clear that applying multiple strikes and Taser deployments to a person in his position (seated, unarmed, and not attempting to flee) was obviously excessive, such that a reasonable officer would understand that this conduct violated clearly established Fourth Amendment rights.",
          "On municipal liability, Velez argues that the City\u2019s failure to train its officers on the appropriate use of force and on handling citizens who verbally object or attempt to record police encounters reflects deliberate indifference to constitutional rights. He points to the coordinated actions of multiple officers during his arrest, the alleged failure of supervisors to intervene or correct the force used, the absence of any meaningful post-incident investigation, and apparent supervisory approval of the officers\u2019 conduct as evidence of a de facto custom or policy tolerating or encouraging excessive force. He asserts that the City should have foreseen the risk that inadequately trained or supervised officers would respond unlawfully to minor resistance or protected speech.",
          "On the state-law failure-to-train theory, Velez contends that the City knew or should have known of the risk that officers who were inadequately trained in de-escalation and the lawful limits of force could cause injuries like those he suffered. He argues that the City\u2019s training and oversight were insufficient to prevent foreseeable harm from officers\u2019 overuse of force during routine traffic stops."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "On probable cause and the wrongful-arrest\/false-imprisonment claims, the defendants argue that Velez\u2019s physical resistance to being removed from the car after lawful orders to exit provided probable cause to believe he was committing the misdemeanor offense of resisting arrest or detention under RSA 642:2. They maintain that officers had the legal authority, for officer safety reasons, to order Velez to step out of the vehicle during a lawful traffic stop, and that when he refused and physically braced himself, he \"knowingly or purposely physically interfere[d]\" with an officer seeking to effect a detention, satisfying the statute. They contend that this objective basis for arrest defeats both the wrongful-arrest and false-imprisonment claims.",
          "On retaliatory arrest, the defendants assert that the existence of probable cause for resisting detention is independently fatal to the First Amendment retaliation claim under Nieves v. Bartlett. They further argue that the record, including body camera footage, shows that the arrest resulted from Velez\u2019s physical noncompliance and bracing against being removed from the car, not from his verbal objections or any attempt to record. They emphasize that Velez did not actually activate a recording device, did not announce that he was recording, and that none of the officers referenced recording or expressed hostility to being recorded.",
          "On excessive force and assault and battery, the defendants argue that the force used was objectively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. They point to Velez\u2019s refusal to comply with clear commands to exit the vehicle, his reaching into his pocket despite direction to keep his hands visible, his resistance to being pulled from the car, his bracing himself against the vehicle frame, and his shouting for help while officers attempted to gain control. They argue that punches and Taser deployments are recognized as legitimate law enforcement tools to overcome resistance and ensure officer safety, and that, given their perception of potential danger in a nighttime encounter at an address associated with criminal activity, their response fell within the range of reasonable force.",
          "On qualified immunity, the defendants argue that even if some aspects of the force used could be deemed excessive in hindsight, the law at the time did not clearly establish that the specific combination and degree of force used in response to Velez\u2019s resistance in a confined vehicle space was unconstitutional. They distinguish Raiche and Alexis on the grounds that those cases involved plaintiffs who were not resisting and were subjected to sudden, severe force without prior commands, whereas Velez was given commands, verbally refused, and physically resisted. They contend that reasonable officers could disagree about the appropriate level of force in these circumstances, entitling them to qualified immunity.",
          "On municipal liability under \u00a7 1983, the defendants argue that Manchester police officers receive use-of-force training at the New Hampshire Police Academy and additional training from the Manchester Police Department, including annual training and periodic review of the use-of-force policy. They maintain that Velez identifies no specific deficiency in the City\u2019s training materials or practices. They emphasize that he relies solely on a single incident\u2014his own arrest\u2014which is ordinarily insufficient to prove a municipal custom or deliberate indifference. They also argue that his reliance on the coordinated nature of the officers\u2019 actions and supervisory review does not show a pre-existing unconstitutional policy or a pattern of similar violations, and that his theory would improperly bypass the requirement to show a municipal policy or custom.",
          "On the state-law failure-to-train claim, the defendants argue that, under New Hampshire negligence standards, Velez has produced no evidence that the City had reason to foresee a risk of incompetence or inexperience in the use of force by Officers Eutzy or Slocum. They note that the uncontested evidence shows that these officers received annual training on the use-of-force continuum and that no prior incidents or complaints suggested that they posed a known risk of unwitting harm. Accordingly, they contend that the City cannot be held liable under a negligence-based failure-to-train theory."

Under RSA 642:2, it is a misdemeanor to knowingly or purposely physically interfere with an officer effecting an arrest or detention, even if the underlying arrest is unlawful, and verbal protest alone is excluded. Once Velez refused a lawful exit order and physically resisted efforts to remove him, a prudent officer could reasonably believe that he was committing resisting arrest\/detention. The \u2018bootstrapping\u2019 argument fails because the officers had authority to order him out during a traffic stop, and probable cause may arise from resistance to that lawful detention. Given the objective facts, the district court\u2019s conclusion that probable cause existed for at least resisting detention, defeating both the \u00a7 1983 wrongful-arrest and state false-imprisonment claims, is likely to be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"Under Nieves v. Bartlett, the existence of probable cause generally defeats a First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claim. Because probable cause for resisting detention existed once Velez physically interfered with being removed from the vehicle, he cannot satisfy the no-probable-cause element. The record as described (including body-camera footage) shows the officers reacting to noncompliance and physical resistance rather than to protected speech or recording: they gave commands, reacted when he reached into his pocket, and escalated force after his refusal and bracing. There is no indication that the officers referenced recording or expressed hostility to his protests. Without the Nieves narrow exception (e.g., a pattern of enforcing a law only when protected speech is involved), which is not shown here, the district court\u2019s rejection of the retaliatory-arrest claim will be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"Excessive-force analysis under Graham looks to offense severity, immediacy of threat, and resistance. The initial precipitating violation is minor (equipment infraction), weighing against heavy force. But the totality also includes a nighttime stop, an address associated with criminal activity, Velez\u2019s refusal to obey an exit order, his reaching into a pocket despite instructions, his physical resistance and bracing, and the confined vehicle space. Within that context, First Circuit precedent often upholds the use of significant but non-lethal force (strikes, taser) to overcome active resistance and secure control. The described sequence\u2014commands, attempts to pull him out, then strikes and taser deployments when he continued to resist\u2014is likely to be viewed as within the range of objectively reasonable responses to an actively resisting, noncompliant suspect in a potentially risky setting. Given similar First Circuit cases distinguishing force against non-resisting vs. resisting subjects, the appellate court will likely agree that no reasonable jury could find the force objectively unreasonable on this record. Because New Hampshire assault-and-battery claims track the same reasonableness standard here, summary judgment on the state claim stands or falls with the Fourth Amendment claim and is likely to be affirmed as well."

          "reasoning":"The district court granted summary judgment by finding no constitutional violation, and therefore did not need to reach qualified immunity. Appellate courts may affirm on that ground without separately analyzing immunity. Even if the panel were to assume a constitutional violation for argument\u2019s sake and reach qualified immunity, the officers would likely be protected: existing First Circuit cases such as Raiche and Alexis involved plaintiffs who were essentially compliant and suddenly subjected to severe force, not suspects actively resisting exit and bracing in a vehicle. There is no clearly established precedent in this circuit holding that using strikes and a taser to remove and subdue an actively resisting, noncompliant driver in a dark, confined context is unconstitutional. At a minimum, reasonable officers could disagree, which means qualified immunity would attach. Thus, whether framed as no violation or as immunity, the judgment in favor of the officers on the excessive-force claim would be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"Monell failure-to-train liability requires a municipal policy or custom and deliberate indifference, typically shown through a pattern of similar violations or clear notice of an obvious need for different training. Velez relies essentially on a single episode\u2014his own arrest\u2014plus general assertions about coordinated officer conduct and lack of discipline. He identifies no specific deficiency in the City\u2019s training program and no history of similar complaints or incidents that would have put policymakers on notice. The undisputed evidence shows that officers attended the state police academy and received regular use-of-force training and policy review. Under both federal Monell standards and New Hampshire negligence-based failure-to-train principles, this record does not establish deliberate indifference or foreseeability of incompetence in the officers\u2019 use of force. Consequently, the district court\u2019s rejection of the \u00a7 1983 municipal-liability and parallel state-law failure-to-train claims is properly affirmed."

      "reasoning":"All appealed issues arise from a summary judgment record anchored by video and largely undisputed facts showing a lawful traffic stop; a lawful command to exit; noncompliance; and active physical resistance. Under New Hampshire\u2019s resisting statute, those facts support probable cause, defeating the wrongful-arrest, false-imprisonment, and retaliatory-arrest claims. The same factual matrix (nighttime, association of location with criminal activity, confined space, resistance, and bracing) makes it likely the First Circuit would agree that the level and sequence of force were within the Graham range of objective reasonableness. In any event, even assuming some excess, the law was not clearly established at a sufficiently specific level to preclude qualified immunity. Finally, the plaintiff\u2019s municipal-liability theories rest on a single incident and do not identify a concrete training deficiency, pattern of similar abuses, or prior notice to the City, which is insufficient under Monell and analogous state negligence standards. Taken together, these considerations support affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment on all issues."

      },
      "factual_background":"In 1960, Fidel Castro\u2019s communist regime in Cuba seized several privately owned Cuban banks and absorbed their assets into Banco Nacional de Cuba (BNC), Cuba\u2019s centralized primary financial institution. Among the seized banks were Banco Pujol and Banco Nu\u00f1ez, which in 1958 controlled assets valued at approximately $25.1 million and $105.1 million respectively. Many former owners and their families fled Cuba and later became United States nationals, maintaining claims to these confiscated assets.\n\nIn 1996, Congress enacted the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, commonly known as the Helms\u2011Burton Act, codified at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6021\u20136091. Title III of the Act creates a private cause of action for U.S. nationals who hold claims to property confiscated by the Cuban government on or after January 1, 1959, allowing them to sue any person who \"traffics\" in that confiscated property. The Act defines \"traffics\" broadly, to include, when done knowingly and intentionally and without authorization from the U.S. national who holds the claim to the property: (i) selling, transferring, distributing, dispensing, brokering, managing, or otherwise disposing of confiscated property, or purchasing, leasing, receiving, possessing, obtaining control of, managing, using, or otherwise acquiring or holding an interest in such property; (ii) engaging in a commercial activity using or otherwise benefiting from confiscated property; or (iii) causing, directing, participating in, or profiting from such trafficking by another person, or engaging in such trafficking through another person. The Act expressly identifies its purposes as strengthening international sanctions against the Castro government, encouraging a transition to democracy in Cuba, protecting U.S. national security against Cuban threats and theft of U.S. property, and protecting U.S. nationals against confiscatory takings and wrongful trafficking in confiscated property.\n\nThe Act contains several temporal and remedial limitations. Section 6084 provides that an action under \u00a7 6082 may not be brought more than two years after the trafficking giving rise to the action \"has ceased to occur.\" Separately, \u00a7 6085(c) authorizes the President to \"suspend the right to bring an action\" under Title III for six\u2011month periods, renewable upon specified findings and reports to Congress, and \u00a7 6085(d) permits the President to rescind any such suspension. From the Act\u2019s effective date in 1996 until May 2019, successive Presidents continuously exercised this suspension authority, so the private right of action (Title III) remained dormant for approximately 23 years.\n\nIn May 2019, President Trump allowed the suspension to lapse and Title III to take effect. Thereafter, numerous Title III suits were filed nationwide, including the actions at issue in this consolidated appeal.\n\nThe plaintiffs here are successors\u2011in\u2011interest to the confiscated assets of Banco Pujol and Banco Nu\u00f1ez. They allege that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (SocGen) and BNP Paribas (Paribas), both large French multinational banks, wrongfully trafficked in the confiscated banking assets by providing financing, credit facilities, and access to hard currency to BNC and other Cuban entities, thereby using and benefiting from the plaintiffs\u2019 confiscated property without authorization or compensation.\n\nAlleged conduct through 2010:\n\n\u2022 BNP Paribas \u2013 Plaintiffs allege that from at least 2000 to 2010, Paribas offered U.S.-dollar financing to Cuban entities primarily through eight credit facilities operated with the involvement of BNC and other Cuban banks. Through these facilities, Paribas allegedly processed more than $1.747 billion in U.S.-dollar transactions, commonly routed through Paribas\u2019s New York branch. One facility allegedly financed a Cuban entity\u2019s purchase of oil in U.S. dollars from the Netherlands via bank\u2011to\u2011bank transfers typically involving New York. Paribas allegedly gave Cuban banks access to U.S. dollars by opening U.S.-dollar accounts for them. Paribas later admitted to much of this conduct in a June 27, 2014 guilty plea in the United States to conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions laws.\n\n\u2022 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 Plaintiffs allege that between 2000 and 2010, SocGen operated at least twenty U.S.-dollar\u2011denominated credit facilities for or involving Cuban entities, six of which involved loans directly or indirectly to BNC. Through these facilities, SocGen allegedly processed at least 2,500 transactions valued at approximately $13 billion, all via New York\u2011based financial institutions. As part of one facility, SocGen, in conjunction with another French bank alleged to be Paribas, purportedly provided a $40 million revolving line of credit to finance importation of crude oil from the Netherlands by a Cuban government\u2011owned corporation. SocGen admitted similar conduct in a 2018 deferred\u2011prosecution agreement in which it consented to the filing of an information charging it with conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions laws.\n\nAccording to plaintiffs, these credit facilities, U.S.-dollar accounts, and related transactions with BNC and other Cuban banks involved or depended on the confiscated assets and banking infrastructure of Banco Pujol and Banco Nu\u00f1ez, thereby constituting trafficking in the plaintiffs\u2019 confiscated property and generating substantial profits for the banks while excluding plaintiffs from any benefit.\n\nAlleged conduct after 2010 and through at least 2018\u20132020:\n\nPlaintiffs assert that after Paribas\u2019s 2014 guilty plea and SocGen\u2019s 2018 deferred\u2011prosecution agreement, the banks continued trafficking in their confiscated property, though in ways intended to avoid direct U.S.-dollar exposure. They allege that the banks continued to provide BNC and other Cuban entities with credit facilities similar to the pre\u20112010 ones, except that the newer facilities excluded U.S.-dollar transactions to avoid U.S. law. Following demand letters sent by plaintiffs in 2019 and 2020, plaintiffs allege that neither defendant represented that it would cease extending credit facilities to BNC, providing BNC with access to U.S. dollars, or otherwise trafficking in confiscated property.\n\nAs to Paribas specifically, plaintiffs allege that, according to a former Paribas compliance officer, Paribas routinely provided parcels of U.S. currency to BNC in Switzerland, including in 2020. Plaintiffs claim that through such deliveries of cash, BNC continued to access international markets and conduct transactions it otherwise could not have conducted. Plaintiffs further allege that Paribas: (1) provided banking services to a German company that made payments into a BNC account until at least 2020, enabling the purchase of fuel from a Cuban government\u2011owned airline; (2) provided a loan, still being repaid in early 2020, to a French company that sold locomotives and rolling stock to a Cuban entity; and (3) through a subsidiary, invested in Melbana Energy between 2018 and 2020, which in turn entered contracts with a Cuban state\u2011affiliated steelmaker. The operative Pujol complaint additionally alleges that until at least December 2018, Paribas provided banking services to RaFin, S.A., an investment firm controlled by the Cuban military. Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that BNC was involved in at least some of these transactions because BNC is the primary financial institution through which foreign companies conduct business in or with Cuba.\n\nAs to SocGen, plaintiffs allege, based on a SocGen employee who had helped create SocGen\u2019s \"Cover Procedures\" used to conceal U.S.-dollar\u2011denominated transactions with BNC, that SocGen continued to profit from providing Cuban entities access to foreign currency until at least September 2019. Plaintiffs allege, again on information and belief, that BNC was involved in these transactions because it is the primary financial institution for foreign companies doing business in or with Cuba. They infer that SocGen thereby continued to give BNC access to U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies that BNC and Cuba otherwise could not have accessed, and that SocGen profited from these activities.\n\nOverall, plaintiffs contend that both banks knowingly and intentionally engaged in commercial activities that used or benefited from the confiscated assets and banking business of Banco Pujol and Banco Nu\u00f1ez, without the authorization of the U.S. nationals who are successors\u2011in\u2011interest to those banks, and that their trafficking activities continued into the period immediately preceding suit.",

        "claims_brought":"The plaintiffs brought private civil damages actions under Title III of the Helms\u2011Burton Act, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6082(a)(1)(A), alleging that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and BNP Paribas trafficked in property confiscated by the Cuban government (the assets and business of Banco Pujol and Banco Nu\u00f1ez) in violation of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6023(13)(A). Plaintiffs sought to recover for alleged trafficking over multiple years, including both pre\u20112010 and post\u20112010 conduct, and invoked pre\u2011suit demand provisions under \u00a7 6082(a)(3)(D) for potential increased liability. No other substantive causes of action beyond Helms\u2011Burton Title III claims are described in the excerpt.",
        "district_court_decision":"Pujol Actions:\n\n\u2022 Filing and initial claims \u2013 On November 9, 2020, the Pujol plaintiffs (successors to Banco Pujol) filed their original complaint in the Southern District of New York (Judge Jesse M. Furman) against SocGen and Paribas (Pujol I). A related second action (Pujol II) by a subset of the Pujol plaintiffs against the same defendants was later filed and consolidated procedurally with Pujol I, with Pujol II stayed pending resolution of Pujol I.\n\n\u2022 First dismissal \u2013 The Pujol plaintiffs amended once. On November 24, 2021, Judge Furman dismissed the once\u2011amended complaint without prejudice. The court held that plaintiffs had Article III standing but that their Helms\u2011Burton claims, which were then based only on conduct through 2010, were untimely under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6084. The court construed \u00a7 6084 as a statute of repose that could not be equitably tolled and found no applicable statutory tolling provisions in the Act.\n\n\u2022 Second Amended Complaint \u2013 Plaintiffs then filed a Second Amended Complaint adding allegations of SocGen\u2019s and Paribas\u2019s conduct from 2018 and later, in an effort to plead timely trafficking within two years of filing. SocGen and Paribas again moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n\u2022 Second dismissal as to SocGen \u2013 On January 23, 2023, Judge Furman granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to SocGen. The court found the new, post\u20112010 allegations concerning SocGen\u2019s dealings with Cuban entities to be conclusory and insufficient to plausibly plead trafficking under the Helms\u2011Burton Act, thus failing to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n\u2022 Proceedings as to Paribas \u2013 The district court likewise viewed the new allegations against Paribas (other than the cash\u2011parcel allegation) as conclusory, but ordered further briefing on two issues: (1) whether the allegation that Paribas delivered parcels of U.S. currency to BNC in Switzerland in or around 2020 satisfied the statutory definition of \"trafficking\" and (2) whether the court could exercise personal jurisdiction over Paribas in connection with that allegation.\n\n\u2022 Final dismissal as to Paribas \u2013 On February 16, 2023, the district court dismissed the claims against Paribas with prejudice. The court held that the cash\u2011parcel allegation did not plausibly satisfy the Helms\u2011Burton Act\u2019s statutory definition of \"trafficking\" and therefore failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). In light of its merits ruling, the court did not reach the personal jurisdiction question. On March 15, 2023, the court dismissed the stayed Pujol II action with prejudice based on the dismissal of the operative complaint in Pujol I.\n\nSucesores Action:\n\n\u2022 Filing and transfer \u2013 The Sucesores plaintiffs (successors to Banco Nu\u00f1ez) first served a demand letter on SocGen on June 10, 2019 and then filed suit in the Southern District of Florida (Judge Darrin P. Gayles) against SocGen and other defendants (since voluntarily dismissed). SocGen moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and the case was consensually transferred to the Southern District of New York on February 4, 2020 (Judge Kimba M. Wood initially, later reassigned to Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil).\n\n\u2022 Demand to Paribas and Second Amended Complaint \u2013 On February 19, 2020, the Sucesores plaintiffs sent a demand letter to Paribas. On September 11, 2020, they filed a Second Amended Complaint naming both SocGen and Paribas as defendants, alleging trafficking based on conduct through 2010.\n\n\u2022 First dismissal \u2013 On December 22, 2021, the district court dismissed the Second Amended Complaint without prejudice. The court held, among other things, that the plaintiffs had standing but that they had not plausibly pleaded that SocGen and Paribas acted \"knowingly and intentionally,\" as required by the statutory definition of \"traffics\" in 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 6023(13)(A).\n\n\u2022 Third Amended Complaint and final dismissal \u2013 Plaintiffs then filed a Third Amended Complaint (the operative Sucesores TAC), adding allegations materially identical to the new post\u20112010 allegations in the Pujol Second Amended Complaint, aimed at curing scienter and timeliness deficiencies. On March 30, 2023, Judge Vyskocil dismissed the Third Amended Complaint with prejudice under Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6). The court held that: (a) with the exception of the allegation that Paribas delivered parcels of U.S. currency to BNC in Switzerland, the new allegations also failed to plausibly plead that defendants did business with BNC after they were put on notice of alleged trafficking; (b) all claims predicated on SocGen conduct before July 2017 and Paribas conduct before September 2018 were untimely under \u00a7 6084, construed as a statute of repose; and (c) the court lacked personal jurisdiction over Paribas in New York regarding any claim arising from the cash\u2011parcel allegation.\n\nIn both the Pujol and Sucesores cases, the district courts recognized plaintiffs\u2019 Article III standing, applied \u00a7 6084 to bar claims based on earlier conduct as untimely, and held that remaining, ostensibly timely allegations, including the cash\u2011parcel allegation, did not adequately plead trafficking, and in Sucesores, that there was no personal jurisdiction over Paribas for the cash\u2011parcel claim.",

Tolling and effect of presidential suspensions \u2013 Plaintiffs appeal the conclusion that \u00a7 6084 is not subject to equitable tolling and that the presidential suspensions of Title III between 1996 and 2019 under \u00a7 6085(c) did not toll or extend the two\u2011year period under \u00a7 6084.\n\n3. Sufficiency of the pleadings (trafficking) \u2013 Plaintiffs appeal the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals for failure to state a claim, including the district courts\u2019 findings that: (a) the added post\u20112010 allegations in the Second Amended Pujol complaint and Third Amended Sucesores complaint were conclusory and did not plausibly allege that SocGen and Paribas continued to traffic in plaintiffs\u2019 confiscated property within the repose period; (b) the allegation that Paribas delivered parcels of U.S. currency to BNC in Switzerland did not plausibly satisfy the Act\u2019s definition of \"trafficking\"; and (c) in Sucesores, plaintiffs failed adequately to plead that defendants acted \"knowingly and intentionally\" as required by \u00a7 6023(13)(A).\n\n4. Personal jurisdiction \u2013 In the Sucesores action, plaintiffs appeal the Rule 12(b)(2) dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction over Paribas in New York with respect to claims arising from the cash\u2011parcel allegation.\n\n5. Standing \u2013 Although the district courts found standing, the appellate opinion identifies as an issue for decision whether plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring Helms\u2011Burton Act claims, and the standing rulings form part of the issues presented and addressed on appeal."

          "Standing: Plaintiffs contend they suffered a concrete, particularized injury because defendants allegedly used, exploited, and derived profit from their confiscated bank assets without permission or compensation, depriving them of the economic benefits of their property. They analogize this harm to unjust enrichment, a historically cognizable cause of action, and argue that SocGen\u2019s and Paribas\u2019s alleged trafficking is fairly traceable to plaintiffs\u2019 inability to benefit from the property. They assert that monetary damages under the Helms\u2011Burton Act would redress this injury.",
          "Nature of \u00a7 6084: Plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 6084 should be construed as a statute of limitations, not a statute of repose. They emphasize that the statute is part of a remedial scheme aimed at deterring ongoing trafficking and compensating victims, and that the operative language can be read as incorporating a continuing\u2011violation concept given that \"trafficking\" is defined to include ongoing and participatory conduct (such as profiting through another person\u2019s trafficking and engaging in commercial activities benefiting from confiscated property). They contend that the two\u2011year period should be subject to equitable tolling, particularly because presidential suspensions made it impossible to sue until 2019.",
          "Tolling by presidential suspensions: Even if \u00a7 6084 is deemed a statute of repose, plaintiffs argue that presidential suspensions under \u00a7 6085(c) legislatively tolled the two\u2011year period. They rely on the statutory terms \"suspend\" and \"rescind,\" arguing that \"suspend the right to bring an action\" naturally implies a temporary interruption of both the right and associated deadlines, such that time during suspensions should not count toward the two\u2011year limit. They argue that \"rescind\" suggests restoring the status quo ante, i.e., that when a suspension is lifted, any previously existing ability to sue is revived with the clock picking up where it left off. They further rely on contemporaneous executive statements (e.g., President Clinton\u2019s 1996 statement that liability would be established \"irreversibly\" during the suspension period and suits could be brought immediately after the suspension is lifted) to show that all branches understood the suspensions as preserving, rather than extinguishing, potential Title III liability during the suspension years.",
          "Timeliness and continuing trafficking: Plaintiffs argue that, even under a strict reading of \u00a7 6084, their claims are timely because they plausibly alleged that SocGen\u2019s and Paribas\u2019s trafficking did not \"cease\" more than two years before suit but continued at least into 2018\u20132020. They contend that the post\u20112010 allegations, including continued credit facilities (albeit in non\u2011U.S. currencies), continued provision of access to foreign currency, and continued involvement with BNC\u2011linked transactions, show a continuing course of trafficking that extended into the repose period. Thus, the two\u2011year period should run from cessation of these later activities, making their 2019 and 2020 filings timely.",
          "Plausibility of trafficking allegations: Plaintiffs argue that the district courts misapplied the pleading standard by discounting their factual allegations as conclusory. They emphasize that they pled specific historical conduct acknowledged in Paribas\u2019s guilty plea and SocGen\u2019s deferred\u2011prosecution agreement, including U.S.-dollar credit facilities and BNC\u2019s central role in Cuba\u2019s financial system. They argue that it is reasonable to infer that similar non\u2011U.S.-dollar facilities continued and that BNC remained involved, particularly given its status as Cuba\u2019s primary financial institution and information from insider employees and compliance officers. They assert that pleading \"upon information and belief\" is appropriate here because many transactional details lie within the banks\u2019 exclusive control.",
          "Cash\u2011parcel allegation against Paribas: Plaintiffs maintain that Paribas\u2019s alleged deliveries of parcels of U.S. currency to BNC in Switzerland in 2020 constitute \"trafficking\" under \u00a7 6023(13)(A). They contend that providing cash to BNC is a commercial activity that enables BNC to use confiscated bank assets and infrastructure, and that Paribas benefits from and profits from BNC\u2019s use of those assets. They argue that the Act\u2019s broad definition of trafficking is intended to capture indirect and facilitative conduct, including causing or profiting from another\u2019s use of confiscated property, and that detailed allegations about what BNC did with the currency are not required at the pleading stage.",
          "Scienter: In response to earlier rulings that they had not adequately pled that defendants acted \"knowingly and intentionally,\" plaintiffs argue that the banks\u2019 admitted sanctions\u2011evading schemes, guilty pleas and deferred\u2011prosecution agreements, and the use of \"cover procedures\" to conceal transactions with BNC support a strong inference that the banks knew they were dealing with BNC and Cuban state entities and intentionally designed structures to facilitate such dealings. They assert that these factual allegations cure any scienter deficiency.",
          "Personal jurisdiction (Sucesores): In Sucesores, plaintiffs argue that the New York court has personal jurisdiction over Paribas because Paribas historically routed relevant U.S.-dollar transactions through New York financial institutions and maintained a New York branch, and because its alleged conduct is sufficiently connected to New York to satisfy both New York\u2019s long\u2011arm statute and due process. They contend that the cash\u2011parcel transactions and continued dealings with BNC and Cuban entities are part of a broader course of dealing that involved and targeted U.S. financial markets, including New York, thereby establishing the necessary contacts and nexus to the claims."

They contended that alleging a bare statutory violation is insufficient for Article III standing absent a traditionally recognized concrete harm.",
          "Nature of \u00a7 6084: Defendants argue that the plain language of \u00a7 6084, which runs from when \"the trafficking giving rise to the action has ceased to occur\" and provides that an action \"may not be brought\" more than two years thereafter, fits the Supreme Court\u2019s description of a statute of repose. They emphasize that the time period runs from the defendant\u2019s last culpable act (cessation of trafficking), not from claim accrual or discovery, and that the mandatory \"may not be brought\" language admits of no equitable exceptions. Accordingly, \u00a7 6084 sets a fixed outer boundary on liability and is not subject to equitable tolling, even if plaintiffs were unable to sue while presidential suspensions were in place.",
          "No tolling from presidential suspensions: Defendants argue that presidential suspensions under \u00a7 6085(c) affect only plaintiffs\u2019 right to sue (Title III\u2019s private cause of action) and do not modify or toll the separate repose provision in \u00a7 6084. They note that \u00a7\u00a7 6085(c)\u2013(d) are silent about the repose period and therefore cannot be read to extend it. They further argue that interpreting suspensions as tolling repose would effectively rewrite the statute, contradict the notion that statutes of repose are not subject to equitable considerations, and undermine Congress\u2019s purpose of providing certainty and finality to potential defendants after a defined period. Defendants also contend that executive statements, such as President Clinton\u2019s 1996 statement, cannot alter the statute\u2019s meaning.",
          "Timeliness and cessation of trafficking: Defendants argue that, under \u00a7 6084 as a statute of repose, any trafficking activity between 2000 and 2010 indisputably ceased more than two years before they were first named in the complaints (between 2019 and 2020). Therefore, any claims based on that historical conduct are time\u2011barred. They contend that plaintiffs\u2019 attempts to characterize trafficking as continuing into the repose period are unsupported by non\u2011conclusory facts. The pre\u20112010 conduct, even if wrongful, cannot support liability once the two\u2011year repose period has expired.",
          "Plausibility and specificity: Defendants argue that the later\u2011period allegations (post\u20112010) are too vague and conclusory to meet the plausibility standard. They emphasize that plaintiffs do not identify specific post\u20112010 transactions with BNC, continuation or renewal of the earlier credit facilities, or concrete facts connecting alleged dealings with Cuban or third\u2011country entities to BNC or to the plaintiffs\u2019 confiscated property. They contend that plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on \"upon information and belief\" and on BNC\u2019s status as Cuba\u2019s \"primary\" financial institution is insufficient to plausibly allege that BNC actually participated in the alleged transactions or that defendants used or benefited from the specific confiscated assets at issue.\n\n      SocGen specifically argues that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that it \"continued\" to provide access to foreign currency to Cuban entities rely solely on a whistleblower\u2019s generalized statements and speculative inferences that BNC must be involved, without concrete factual support. Paribas argues similarly regarding alleged dealings with German and French companies, Melbana Energy, and RaFin, asserting that plaintiffs fail to allege any particular transaction involving BNC or the confiscated assets, and that the necessary facts are not uniquely within defendants\u2019 control given plaintiffs\u2019 purported access to insider sources.",
          "Cash\u2011parcel allegation: Paribas argues that the allegation that it delivered parcels of U.S. currency to BNC in Switzerland does not meet the statutory definition of \"trafficking\" because plaintiffs do not allege that the cash itself was confiscated property, nor do they allege facts showing that Paribas engaged in commercial activity \"using or otherwise benefiting from\" plaintiffs\u2019 confiscated property. Paribas contends that the complaint does not specify what BNC did with the cash, whether BNC used confiscated property in connection with such deliveries, or whether Paribas profited from trafficking by BNC involving the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Without such factual detail, Paribas argues, plaintiffs fail to plausibly allege any of the statutory prongs of trafficking under \u00a7 6023(13)(A).",
          "Scienter: Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that any post\u20112010 dealings were undertaken \"knowingly and intentionally\" as trafficking in confiscated property as required by \u00a7 6023(13)(A). They contend that plaintiffs impermissibly infer scienter from past sanctions\u2011related wrongdoing, without factual allegations that defendants knew they were dealing with the specific confiscated assets of Banco Pujol or Banco Nu\u00f1ez or that they intended to exploit those assets. Defendants argue that knowledge of dealing with Cuban entities subject to sanctions is not equivalent to knowledge of trafficking in particular confiscated property for Helms\u2011Burton purposes.",
          "Personal jurisdiction (Sucesores): In Sucesores, Paribas argues that New York courts lack personal jurisdiction over it for claims arising from the alleged 2020 cash\u2011parcel deliveries because those deliveries allegedly occurred in Switzerland and involved BNC and Cuban commerce, not New York. Paribas contends that these alleged acts neither occurred in New York nor were directed at New York, and therefore do not satisfy New York\u2019s long\u2011arm statute or due process requirements. It argues that its historical use of New York correspondent accounts for pre\u20112010 U.S.-dollar transactions is unrelated to the specific cash\u2011parcel claim and cannot support specific jurisdiction for that claim."

The cash\u2011parcel allegation, standing alone, is especially attenuated: the cash is not alleged to be confiscated property, and there is no non\u2011speculative allegation tying Paribas\u2019s deliveries to the use of the specific confiscated bank assets for Paribas\u2019s benefit. That failure in pleading the statutory elements, plus the lack of New York\u2011related conduct for the Swiss cash\u2011parcel theory in Sucesores, supports affirmance on both the merits and jurisdictional grounds.\n\nWhile Article III standing is likely to be recognized\u2014because the statute protects a concrete property interest and the alleged unjust enrichment is sufficiently concrete and redressable\u2014that recognition does not save plaintiffs\u2019 claims from dismissal on timeliness and sufficiency grounds. Because every challenged aspect of the district courts\u2019 rulings is likely to be upheld, the overall result on appeal is an affirmance of the judgments in favor of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and BNP Paribas."

      },
      "factual_background":"From 2000 to 2001, Jesus Santiago committed several state and federal felonies in New York and Virginia.\n\n1. New York state charges and plea\n- In January 2000, Santiago shot someone in the leg with a handgun in Brooklyn, New York.\n- He was indicted in Kings County Supreme Court on two counts of assault, two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, and one count of criminal possession of a loaded firearm.\n- He was released on bond pending trial but fled New York.\n\n2. Federal conviction in Virginia\n- About a year and a half later, Santiago was arrested in Virginia on separate federal charges.\n- He was indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.\n- In November 2001, he pled guilty to possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and was sentenced to 37 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release.\n- Conditions of his federal supervised release included regularly reporting to his federal probation officer and submitting to drug testing.\n\n3. Return to New York and state plea\/sentencing\n- While incarcerated federally in December 2001, Santiago wrote to the New York state court seeking to resolve his pending Brooklyn charges.\n- In January 2002, he was transferred from federal custody in Virginia to New York state custody.\n- On May 3, 2002, while still serving his federal sentence, Santiago pled guilty in Kings County Supreme Court before Justice Sheldon Greenberg to one count of criminal possession of a weapon.\n- During the plea, Justice Greenberg explained that, in exchange for the plea, the court promised: (1) the minimum determinate prison term for a Class C violent felony of three and a half years, to run concurrently with his federal sentence from January 2, 2002; and (2) a five-year term of post-release supervision (PRS) as mandated for a Class C felony.\n- Santiago affirmed multiple times on the record that he understood and agreed to this plea arrangement, including the five-year PRS term. The Kings County District Attorney\u2019s Office also agreed.\n- Santiago asked to be sentenced immediately, but Justice Greenberg said he could not do so until receipt of the presentence report and scheduled sentencing for two weeks later.\n- On May 14, 2002, because Justice Greenberg was unavailable after a car accident, Justice Gustin Reichbach conducted the sentencing hearing.\n- The minutes or transcript of that sentencing could not later be located. The parties later stipulated that Santiago received a three-and-a-half-year prison term at that hearing and that there was no mention of post-release supervision.\n- After sentencing, a court clerk completed a \"Sentence and Order of Commitment\" form, recording the 3.5-year concurrent prison term starting January 2, 2002. The form had no place to record PRS, and no PRS term was written in.\n\n4. DOCS custody and calculation of sentence\n- In April 2004, Santiago was released from federal custody and transferred to the New York State Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) to serve the balance of his concurrent state sentence.\n- DOCS calculated his remaining state prison term to expire on May 29, 2005.\n- DOCS assumed that the sentencing court had imposed the statutory PRS term, because New York law (as amended in 1998 for violent felonies) made a period of PRS mandatory following determinate sentences for such offenses. DOCS therefore treated Santiago as subject to a mandatory five-year PRS period following his prison term.\n\n5. Conditional release and overlapping supervision\n- On November 5, 2004, Santiago was conditionally released from state prison approximately seven months early.\n- Under New York law, a conditionally released inmate\u2019s remaining prison time is held in abeyance, and a violation of supervision conditions can result in reincarceration with no credit for time spent in violation until reincarcerated or restored to supervision.\n- As a result, about seven months of Santiago\u2019s imprisonment term was held in abeyance while he served what DOCS understood to be a mandatory PRS term.\n- During this period, Santiago was simultaneously serving his state PRS and his federal supervised release from the 2001 federal conviction.\n- Both the state PRS and federal supervised release required him to report to a probation officer, submit to drug testing, and remain in New York State.\n- Within about a year, Santiago moved to Virginia in violation of both his state PRS and federal supervised release conditions.\n\n6. Virginia arrests and federal violation\n- On October 30, 2005, Virginia local authorities arrested Santiago on charges relating to brandishing a firearm and possession of marijuana. He was released from local custody on November 17, 2005. It appears neither federal nor New York authorities were notified of this arrest or release at the time.\n- In October 2006, federal authorities again arrested Santiago in Virginia for violating his federal supervised release terms.\n- The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found he had violated federal supervised release conditions and sentenced him to eight months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 30 additional months of supervised release.\n\n7. 2007\u20132008 New York reincarceration on PRS violation\n- After serving that new federal term, Santiago was transferred to New York on June 12, 2007.\n- New York officials charged him with violating his state PRS by absconding to Virginia and committing new crimes in 2005 and 2006.\n- An administrative law judge for the state Division of Parole sustained these charges and ordered Santiago returned to DOCS custody to be incarcerated until February 2, 2008.\n- Because February 2, 2008, fell on a Saturday, Santiago was released from state prison on February 1, 2008.\n- After release, he remained subject to both federal supervised release and state PRS, whose conditions again prohibited leaving New York.\n- By approximately February 6, 2008, only a few days after his release, Santiago had departed New York and returned to Virginia in violation of both federal and state supervision conditions.\n\n8. Additional Virginia convictions and federal violation (post\u20112008)\n- About two months later, Virginia authorities arrested Santiago on the outstanding 2005 charges for brandishing a firearm and marijuana possession.\n- He pled guilty in Virginia state court to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment with eight years suspended, conditioned on one year of supervised probation.\n- While serving that Virginia sentence, in June 2008 Santiago appeared again in the Eastern District of Virginia on charges that he violated the federal supervised release that had begun when he left New York in February 2008.\n- The federal court found he violated those terms and sentenced him to seven months\u2019 imprisonment and two additional years of supervised release.\n\n9. Earley and subsequent New York legislative\/judicial developments\n- In 2006, the Second Circuit decided Earley v. Murray, holding that a New York state court imposing a determinate prison sentence must orally pronounce any PRS term in the defendant\u2019s presence, and that a PRS term not pronounced in court is a nullity, even if required by statute.\n- Earley indicated that when DOCS discovered a missing oral pronouncement of a mandatory PRS term, its proper course was to inform the state and allow the state to seek correction through judicial proceedings, not to administratively add or enforce PRS.\n- Earley\u2019s reasoning affected thousands of New York sentences where PRS may not have been orally imposed. At that time, however, only courts, prosecutors, or defendants could initiate resentencing; DOCS and the Division of Parole (DOP) had no statutory authority to refer cases on their own.\n- Many state officials and offices did not promptly act to adjust affected sentences. Some district attorneys, including in Kings County, resisted efforts to strike or correct administratively imposed PRS and challenged Earley-based relief.\n- New York state courts sometimes held that DOP was obligated to enforce PRS despite Earley and often declined to transfer matters to the sentencing courts for resentencing when DOCS or DOP requested it. A declaratory judgment action filed by DOCS and DOP seeking a systematic procedure for resentencing was not granted the requested injunctive relief.\n- In April 2008, the New York Court of Appeals decided People v. Sparber and Garner v. DOCS, holding that state statutes required the sentencing judge to orally pronounce PRS in open court and that the remedy for a failure to do so was to vacate the sentence and remit for resentencing.\n- In June 2008, the New York legislature enacted a statute (N.Y. Corr. Law \u00a7 601-d) authorizing DOCS and DOP to refer defendants with potentially unpronounced PRS terms back to sentencing courts for resentencing. Under this procedure, DOCS\/DOP would notify the court and the defendant; the court would determine if PRS had in fact been pronounced, and if not, schedule a resentencing where the court could impose a corrected sentence with or without PRS, consistent with N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 70.85.\n\n10. 2010 return to New York and resentencing\n- In September 2010, Santiago was released from federal prison in Virginia and transferred back to New York on charges that he had violated his state PRS conditions in February 2008 by leaving the state.\n- By this time, the 2008 legislation authorizing DOCS\/DOP referrals for resentencing was in effect.\n- Based on that law, DOP referred Santiago to the state court to review whether his PRS should remain in force.\n- On December 15, 2010, Santiago and the Kings County District Attorney\u2019s Office appeared before Justice Reichbach.\n- Santiago requested resentencing without a PRS term, and the District Attorney\u2019s Office consented.\n- Justice Reichbach orally resentenced Santiago without a term of PRS and issued a written order reflecting that disposition.\n- Following that resentencing, Santiago was released.\n\n11. Later criminal history noted in the record\n- In May 2012, the federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia sentenced Santiago to nine months\u2019 imprisonment for violating federal supervised release.\n- In November 2012, he was charged in Virginia state court with additional crimes, pled guilty to issuing a bomb threat and to assault, and was incarcerated in Virginia until May 2015.\n\nOverall, Santiago\u2019s civil claims center on two distinct periods in which New York enforced a PRS term that had not been pronounced at his 2002 sentencing: (a) his incarceration from June 12, 2007 to February 1, 2008, following a PRS-violation hearing; and (b) his incarceration from September to December 2010 before his 2010 resentencing without PRS.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In May 2012, Jesus Santiago filed a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He sued various New York state corrections and parole officials, ultimately including Brian Fischer (Commissioner of DOCS\/DOCCS), Anthony J. Annucci (Deputy Commissioner and Counsel to DOCS), and Terrence X. Tracy (Chief Counsel to the Division of Parole). Santiago alleged that state officials violated his constitutional rights by enforcing a term of post-release supervision that had not been orally pronounced at his 2002 sentencing, in violation of Earley and related due process principles. He sought compensatory and punitive damages for periods of incarceration he claimed were unlawful, principally his 2007\u20132008 incarceration for PRS violations and his September\u2013December 2010 incarceration prior to resentencing.\n\nThe core theory was that DOCS and DOP administratively treated him as subject to a PRS term that the sentencing judge never orally imposed, causing him to be supervised, violated, and reincarcerated under an invalid PRS term.",
        "district_court_decision":"Summary judgment stage (2017):\n- The parties cross-moved for summary judgment.\n- The district court identified Fischer, Annucci, and Tracy as personally involved in the alleged constitutional deprivation and denied them summary judgment on that ground.\n- The court held that these defendants were entitled to qualified immunity for conduct occurring before the Second Circuit's Earley decision (2006) and before June 12, 2007, because during that period Santiago was either not in New York custody or Earley had not yet clarified the constitutional issue, and he would not have been available for resentencing.\n- The court held they were not entitled to qualified immunity for the period from June 12, 2007 (when Santiago reentered New York custody) through February 6, 2008 (when he absconded again), during which DOCS and DOP enforced the unpronounced PRS against him.\n- The court again granted qualified immunity to the defendants for the period after Santiago\u2019s return to New York in September 2010, reasoning that by then the officials took prompt and objectively reasonable steps\u2014using the new statutory procedure\u2014to refer him to state court for resentencing, leading to his December 2010 resentencing without PRS. On that basis, the court dismissed his damages claims related to incarceration from September to December 2010.\n\nPretrial evidentiary rulings (2022):\n- The district court scheduled a jury trial on the remaining claims relating to the 2007\u20132008 incarceration.\n- In motions in limine filed in July 2022, defendants sought to introduce evidence that legal and administrative impediments (including state law, the positions of district attorneys, and actions of state courts) limited their ability to unilaterally release inmates or obtain resentencing after Earley, and that these impediments affected what they could do for Santiago between June 2007 and February 2008. They argued this evidence was relevant to causation and to their state of mind for punitive damages.\n- Defendants also moved to adjourn the trial pending Second Circuit decisions (Vincent v. Annucci and Aponte v. Perez) addressing similar issues.\n- At an October 2022 status conference, the district court indicated it would not allow evidence of such impediments, stating it viewed the evidence as irrelevant because it believed causation was already resolved and the jury would only determine damages. The court stated the jury would be told that the defendants had custody of Santiago after Earley and did not send him back for resentencing.\n- In November 2022, the court reiterated that it would exclude evidence of impediments, even when offered to show defendants\u2019 subjective understanding that they lacked authority to release Santiago or initiate resentencing.\n- Defendants argued that such evidence was at least relevant to punitive damages (showing absence of evil motive or reckless indifference). They submitted a 2008 governor\u2019s memorandum indicating that court participation was crucial to resolving PRS issues and that, in many cases, missing sentencing minutes made it impossible for DOCS\/DOP to know whether PRS had been properly imposed, thus requiring judicial resolution.\n- The district court issued a written order (Santiago v. Fischer, Nov. 25, 2022) holding that defendants could not introduce evidence of their understanding that they lacked legal authority to release Santiago or refer him to court. The court reasoned that such evidence risked confusing the jury and that the issues of liability and causation had already been extensively litigated and determined in prior Second Circuit cases.\n\nTrial (November 2022):\n- The case proceeded to a jury trial limited to claims arising from Santiago\u2019s incarceration from June 12, 2007 to February 1, 2008.\n- Consistent with the in limine ruling, the jury did not hear detailed testimony about legal or administrative obstacles posed by state law, prosecutors, or courts to releasing Santiago or referring him for resentencing. Nor did they hear full evidence of the defendants\u2019 understanding of their authority post\u2011Earley.\n- The jury heard evidence that DOCS and DOP treated Santiago as subject to a PRS term that had not been orally pronounced, that he was reincarcerated for PRS violations between June 2007 and February 2008, and that defendants did not initiate any resentencing or release during that period.\n- In closing, Santiago\u2019s counsel argued that defendants could have promptly referred him for resentencing or released him after Earley, and that they nonetheless failed to act. Defendants were limited in their ability to rebut this with evidence of impediments.\n- The jury returned a verdict awarding Santiago $100,000 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in punitive damages for the 2007\u20132008 period.\n\nPost\u2011trial motion (Rule 50\/59) (2023):\n- Defendants filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, for a new trial.\n- While the motion was pending, the Second Circuit issued Vincent v. Annucci (Vincent II), which addressed the need to consider whether legal or practical impediments limited what corrections officials could do to release or resentencing inmates with administratively imposed PRS terms, and emphasized the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove causation of damages.\n- In supplemental briefing, defendants argued that, in light of Vincent II, a new trial was required because the district court had prevented them from presenting evidence of impediments, thus relieving Santiago of his burden to prove that their conduct caused the length of his incarceration.\n- The district court denied the motion (Santiago v. Fischer, Apr. 16, 2023). It concluded that Vincent II did not require a new trial because, in its view, defendants had testified about their understanding, experiences, and perceived obstacles in complying with Earley and about steps taken specifically as to Santiago\u2019s PRS sentence.\n- The court found that defendants had offered testimony about logistical processes and perceived impediments (needing court orders to modify sentences, lack of sentencing minutes, efforts to create databases of illegal PRS sentences, and efforts to work with county officials), and that the jury was entitled to disbelieve their explanations and to find that their delay reflected unreasonable noncompliance.\n- The court also upheld the punitive damages award, finding that, based on the trial evidence, the jury could decide whether defendants\u2019 delay in complying with Earley showed callous and reckless disregard of Santiago\u2019s rights and caused his injuries. The court characterized additional testimony about New York\u2019s PRS statute (\u201cJenna\u2019s Law\u201d) as of marginal relevance and potentially confusing.\n\nAs a result of these rulings, the district court\u2019s final posture was:\n- Liability and damages (including punitive damages) were imposed on Fischer, Annucci, and Tracy for the 2007\u20132008 incarceration based on enforcement of an unpronounced PRS term and failure to secure resentencing or release.\n- Claims relating to the September\u2013December 2010 incarceration were dismissed on summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, with the court finding the officials\u2019 conduct in 2010 was objectively reasonable given the steps they took to obtain resentencing under the 2008 statute.",
        "what_is_appealed":"On appeal, the defendants (Fischer, Annucci, and Tracy) and Santiago each challenge different aspects of the district court\u2019s rulings:\n\n- Defendants\u2019 appeal:\n  1. They challenge the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings excluding evidence of legal and administrative impediments (including state prosecutors\u2019 and courts\u2019 responses to Earley and the defendants\u2019 understanding of their authority) that allegedly prevented or limited their ability to unilaterally release Santiago or secure resentencing after Earley. They argue that excluding this evidence improperly limited their defense on causation and state of mind (especially as to punitive damages).\n  2. They challenge the denial of their post\u2011trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial, contending that under Vincent II and related precedents, Santiago had the burden to prove that their conduct, rather than independent impediments, caused his incarceration and that the jury could not properly assess causation or punitive damages intent without the excluded evidence.\n  3. They also contest the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity for the 2007\u20132008 period, arguing that in light of Earley, Sparber, Garner, later clarifications in Vincent, and the particular facts of Santiago\u2019s case (including his awareness of PRS at the plea and systemic resistance by other state actors), a reasonable official might not have known that continuing to enforce PRS or delaying action pending further legal clarification was unlawful.\n\n- Santiago\u2019s cross\u2011appeal:\n  1. He challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on his claims relating to his incarceration from September to December 2010, arguing that the court wrongly concluded the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity for that period.\n  2. He contends that prior Second Circuit decisions (including Betances and Hassell) preclude granting qualified immunity based on post\u2011Earley remedial efforts and that the same principles governing the 2007\u20132008 period should apply to his 2010 incarceration, when PRS continued to be enforced in his case until his December 2010 resentencing."

          "Defendants contend the district court improperly excluded critical evidence of \"impediments\"\u2014including state statutory constraints, the resistance of district attorneys and courts to implementing Earley, and the absence of a mechanism for DOCS or DOP to initiate resentencing before the 2008 legislation. They argue this evidence was directly relevant to whether they could have lawfully released Santiago or obtained his resentencing between June 2007 and February 2008. Without it, the jury was left with an incomplete and misleading picture suggesting that they simply ignored Earley, which affected both causation and punitive damages.",
          "They argue that, under Vincent II, plaintiffs in \u00a7 1983 cases must prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct, rather than independent legal or practical barriers, caused the alleged unlawful detention. The excluded evidence would have shown that other actors (courts, prosecutors) and legal rules could have prevented or delayed Santiago\u2019s release or resentencing even if defendants had taken additional steps. Thus, the exclusion relieved Santiago of his burden to prove causation and improperly allowed the jury to assume that prompt release or resentencing was feasible and legally available.",
          "Regarding punitive damages, defendants maintain that evidence of their efforts to comply with Earley\u2014such as consulting with the Office of Court Administration, engaging with district attorneys who opposed striking PRS, trying to create comprehensive databases of affected inmates, and seeking judicial guidance\u2014was essential to show the absence of evil motive or reckless indifference. They argue that, without hearing about these efforts and the legal uncertainty, the jury could wrongly infer that their delay was a deliberate or callous refusal to comply with federal law.",
          "On qualified immunity for the 2007\u20132008 period, defendants argue that Earley did not clearly establish the unlawfulness of their particular conduct in Santiago\u2019s circumstances. Unlike Earley and similar cases, Santiago was expressly told during his plea that he would receive a five-year PRS term and agreed to that sentence. The later sentencing judge then imposed the prison term without mentioning PRS, and the commitment order did not list PRS. Defendants argue that it was not clearly established that continuing to enforce a statutorily mandated PRS term under these atypical circumstances was unconstitutional, especially while many state courts continued to require enforcement of PRS and resisted Earley\u2019s implementation.",
          "They further assert that, prior to the 2008 legislative amendment, DOCS and DOP lacked statutory authority to refer cases like Santiago\u2019s for resentencing on their own, and their attempts to obtain judicial clarification were rebuffed. They contend that a reasonable official could believe that enforcing mandatory PRS until courts or prosecutors acted was lawful, given the ambiguity created by conflicting state-court rulings and the absence of a clear, administratively available remedy.",
          "Regarding the 2010 incarceration, defendants state that once Santiago returned to New York in September 2010, they promptly used the new statutory procedures to refer him for resentencing, leading to his December 2010 resentencing without PRS and release. They argue that these prompt, objectively reasonable steps demonstrate that they did not cause any extended unlawful detention beyond what the law and procedural requirements would have imposed, and that any liability for this period should be evaluated with full consideration of the same types of impediments discussed for 2007\u20132008."

          "He argues that the jury reasonably concluded that defendants had the ability and obligation to act after Earley to prevent his unconstitutional incarceration but unreasonably delayed doing so, and that this delay supported both compensatory damages (for the period of incarceration that should have been avoided) and punitive damages (for reckless or callous disregard of his rights). Allowing defendants to rely on broad evidence of systemic resistance or legal uncertainty, he argues, would improperly dilute their responsibility to comply with clearly established federal law.",
          "Regarding the 2010 period, Santiago asserts that the district court\u2019s grant of qualified immunity and dismissal of his 2010-incarceration claims conflicts with Second Circuit case law, particularly Hassell\u2019s statement that officials cannot escape liability by pointing to belated remedial measures taken after Earley. He argues that the same principles that barred qualified immunity for the 2007\u20132008 period apply equally to the 2010 incarceration, because he remained detained under a PRS term that had never been orally imposed until his December 2010 resentencing.",
          "He further maintains that, even if defendants eventually used the new statutory resentencing mechanism, they should be held liable for any period during which they continued to enforce an unconstitutional PRS term before that resentencing occurred, and that his claims for damages related to the 2010 incarceration should proceed to trial rather than being barred at summary judgment."

The judge repeatedly stated that causation and liability were already essentially determined and that the jury was only to decide damages, then barred defendants from introducing evidence about their understanding (and the broader legal landscape) to rebut plaintiff\u2019s narrative that they simply could have released him or obtained resentencing. That was a legal error as to the proper scope of the plaintiff\u2019s burden on causation and of the relevance of this evidence to both compensatory and punitive damages under Vincent II and related cases. Given that causation and punitive intent were heavily contested, and that the closing argument squarely asserted that defendants could have \u2018just sent him back\u2019 or released him, the exclusion was not harmless; it likely affected both the size of compensatory damages and, especially, the large punitive award.

Later decisions like Betances, Vincent, Hassell, and Aponte confirm that by the post\u2011Earley period at issue, it was clearly established that continuing to enforce such PRS or reincarcerating on it violated the prisoner\u2019s rights, even amid state\u2011court resistance or statutory gaps. The unusual feature that Santiago had been told about PRS at his plea does not meaningfully distinguish this case\u2014Earley and Sparber\/Garner focus on the need for an oral pronouncement at sentencing, not on plea\u2011colloquy expectations. Nor do systemic obstacles or lack of a perfect remedial mechanism change what a reasonable official would understand about the unlawfulness of continuing to punish someone under an unpronounced component of a sentence. Thus, while state of mind and impediments are relevant to damages and perhaps causation, they do not entitle defendants to qualified immunity for that 2007\u20132008 enforcement; the denial of qualified immunity for that period should stand."

Existing Second Circuit precedent holds that it was already clearly established that officials could not simply continue to enforce administratively imposed PRS indefinitely after Earley. But those same cases also emphasize that the plaintiff must prove that the particular officials actually caused the period of confinement, and that reasonably prompt, good\u2011faith use of the then\u2011available judicial mechanism can limit or negate damages and, in some circumstances, support qualified immunity for discrete later periods. Given the short duration at issue, the officials\u2019 prompt resort to the corrective statute once he was again in their custody, and the need to obtain judicial resentencing before PRS could be formally terminated, it was objectively reasonable for them to believe their conduct in 2010 complied with clearly established law.

      "reasoning":"The appellate panel is likely to track its own recent Earley\u2011line decisions. Those decisions (especially Betances, Vincent, Hassell, and Aponte) confirm that: (1) it was clearly established by mid\u20112007 that DOCS\/DOP could not constitutionally continue to enforce unpronounced PRS and reincarcerate on that basis, defeating qualified immunity for the 2007\u20132008 period; (2) however, causation and the scope of damages turn on a fact\u2011intensive inquiry into what would have occurred had officials acted lawfully, including consideration of legal and practical impediments and the officials\u2019 understanding of their authority; and (3) by 2010, where officials promptly used the new statutory mechanism and obtained resentencing, qualified immunity can apply to that later period. \n\nAgainst that backdrop, the district court\u2019s categorical evidentiary exclusion in the 2007\u20132008 trial\u2014resting on the view that causation\/liability had essentially been predetermined and that impediment evidence was irrelevant\u2014conflicts with the causation framework emphasized in Vincent II and improperly restricted the jury\u2019s ability to assess both compensatory and punitive damages. That constitutes an abuse of discretion requiring a new trial on those claims, even while the denial of qualified immunity for that period is affirmed. Conversely, for the 2010 period, the undisputed facts show prompt use of the 2008 resentencing procedure and a short, court\u2011driven timeline, making the grant of qualified immunity for that period consistent with circuit precedent. The result is a mixed disposition: affirming the qualified\u2011immunity rulings for both periods (denial for 2007\u20132008; grant for 2010), but reversing and remanding for a new trial on liability\u2011caused damages and punitive damages for the 2007\u20132008 incarceration because of the evidentiary error."

      },
      "factual_background":"The Frank J. Wood Bridge is a bridge built in 1932 that connects the municipalities of Topsham and Brunswick, Maine. It is a key piece of transportation infrastructure but is no longer capable of safely performing its needed role without substantial work. In the absence of significant rehabilitation or replacement, traffic restrictions and eventual closure of the bridge are expected.\n\nThe bridge is historic and is part of a historic district. Because Maine's Department of Transportation (MDOT) intends to use federal funds to replace the bridge, MDOT is required to obtain approval from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and to comply with several federal statutes, including section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act and the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. \u00a7 306108). Section 4(f) restricts approval of projects that \"use\" protected historic properties unless there is no prudent and feasible alternative, and implementing regulations (23 C.F.R. \u00a7 774.17) provide that an alternative is not prudent if it results in additional construction, maintenance, or operational costs of an \"extraordinary magnitude.\"\n\nMDOT concluded that replacement of the bridge, rather than rehabilitation, is the preferable course. In reaching that conclusion, MDOT compared the costs of rehabilitation and replacement. Using 2016 cost estimates and a service-life analysis, MDOT determined that rehabilitation would cost more than double the cost of replacement while providing a shorter service life. MDOT also performed a life\u2011cycle cost analysis that discounted future costs to present value, which produced a smaller cost differential of roughly 53%, but MDOT did not rely on the discounted figure in its decision and did not substantively explain that choice, despite internal and federal guidance indicating that discounting is the standard and preferred way to compare future costs.\n\nOver the objections of historic preservation groups, including the plaintiffs, the FHWA granted MDOT approval under section 4(f) to replace the bridge. The plaintiffs have opposed replacement on the ground that rehabilitation is a prudent and feasible alternative that would preserve the historic bridge and that the agencies\u2019 cost comparisons and analytic methods are flawed.\n\nAfter remand proceedings (described below), the FHWA prepared a final Section 4(f) Limited Scope Re\u2011Evaluation. There, the FHWA acknowledged that MDOT's cost estimate for constructing a new bridge had risen significantly, from about $13 million in 2019 to about $42 million in 2022. Plaintiffs argued that this escalation erased or reversed the previously identified 53% cost differential when using updated life\u2011cycle costs and that rehabilitation would now be less expensive than replacement over the relevant horizon.\n\nTo support this contention, plaintiffs submitted calculations prepared by engineer Robert Shulock. Shulock \"updated\" MDOT's 2016 rehabilitation estimate using an inflation adjustment. According to his analysis, the updated, discounted life\u2011cycle cost of rehabilitation would be approximately $25 million, implying a savings of about $18 million as compared to MDOT's updated 2022 estimate for reconstruction (approximately $42 million). Plaintiffs asserted that this showed rehabilitation to be a cost-saving, prudent, and feasible alternative under section 4(f).\n\nIn the Re\u2011Evaluation, the FHWA did not undertake its own recalculation of updated comparative costs or recompute the differential between replacement and rehabilitation. It stated that its task on remand was limited by the earlier appellate mandate. The FHWA also explained that it did not find Shulock's updated rehabilitation estimate persuasive. Relying on an internal technical review, the agency identified multiple perceived flaws in Shulock\u2019s analysis, including: (1) use of an inflation factor (23%) that the FHWA viewed as too low in light of producer price indices for steel components (66\u201390%) and a roughly 40% general increase in construction costs, which, in the FHWA\u2019s view, suggested that increases affecting replacement would apply at least equally to rehabilitation; (2) omission from the rehabilitation estimate of major items included in the replacement estimate, such as local amenities, utility work, and full right-of-way costs; (3) underestimation of costs for painting, site access\/trestle, removal of existing slab, and construction of a temporary bridge needed for rehabilitation; (4) inadequate consideration of differences in long-term maintenance costs, which the FHWA viewed as a key factor distinguishing rehabilitation from replacement; and (5) reliance on a New Hampshire bridge rehabilitation project that was smaller (about one-third the square footage) and less extensive in scope than the Frank J. Wood Bridge project.\n\nThe FHWA stated that, for these reasons, it was not persuaded that inflation and other cost considerations raised in public comments materially changed its earlier conclusions in the draft section 4(f) Re\u2011Evaluation. The agency further noted that, beyond dollar costs, there are additional risks and uncertainties associated with keeping a fracture-critical bridge (one with non-redundant elements whose failure could cause collapse) in service beyond its intended service life, even if extensively rehabilitated. The FHWA explained that such risks are not fully captured in cost estimates because of difficulties in consistently monitoring for defects and because necessary inspections would be time-intensive and highly disruptive.",

Wood Bridge, plaintiffs (historic preservation organizations and related entities) filed a petition for review in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. They brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that the agencies\u2019 section 4(f) determination and related analyses were arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law, and they also raised challenges under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). After a prior appeal and remand, plaintiffs later filed a new suit in February 2023 again under the APA, contending that the FHWA\u2019s post\u2011remand Section 4(f) Limited Scope Re\u2011Evaluation was arbitrary and capricious because the agency failed to consider updated cost information in MDOT\u2019s possession and, if properly considered, that information would show that rehabilitation is a prudent and feasible alternative under section 4(f).",

Plaintiffs appealed that decision, leading to an earlier appellate opinion that vacated the FHWA\u2019s decision in part and remanded for further proceedings strictly limited to how costs were treated under section 4(f).\n\nOn remand from the first appeal, the district court issued an order remanding the matter to the FHWA with instructions mirroring the appellate mandate: the agency was to further justify its prior use of non\u2011discounted costs and\/or decide whether a 53% price differential, derived from discounted cost analysis (life\u2011cycle cost analysis), constituted a cost of extraordinary magnitude under 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 774.17.\n\nAfter the FHWA completed its Section 4(f) Limited Scope Re\u2011Evaluation and again concluded that rehabilitation was not a prudent and feasible alternative, plaintiffs initiated the 2023 suit in district court. In that action, plaintiffs argued that FHWA\u2019s refusal to consider updated cost estimates was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and also asserted a NEPA violation based on alleged failure to consider new information. The district court denied various requests by plaintiffs for preliminary injunctive relief to halt or stay bridge replacement construction. Ultimately, in January 2024, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the federal and state transportation defendants. The court held, among other things, that the FHWA was required to rely on the 2016 cost estimates that were before it at the time of the original agency action and that the agency had complied with the prior appellate remand instructions by addressing whether the 53% cost differential constituted a cost of extraordinary magnitude. Given that conclusion, the district court found it unnecessary to address plaintiffs\u2019 arguments about how use of 2022 cost estimates might affect whether rehabilitation is a prudent and feasible alternative.

Here, FHWA hewed closely to the mandate, treated the 2016 estimates and the 53% discounted differential as controlling, and then provided a detailed, technical explanation for why the plaintiffs\u2019 new cost submissions did not justify revisiting its underlying prudence determination. It did not rely on new data as a fresh foundation for its decision but instead explained why that data were insufficient to disturb the prior analysis. Under deferential APA review, those explanations are likely to be deemed adequate, and the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the agencies is likely to be affirmed on all issues. The appellants\u2019 strongest point\u2014the sheer magnitude of the later cost increase\u2014is weakened by the absence of reliable evidence that rehabilitation costs rose relatively less, and the agency\u2019s explicit treatment of that contention gives the court a rational basis to uphold the refusal to reopen or recalculate. Accordingly, a full affirmance is the most probable appellate outcome."

      "factual_background":"The dispute arises out of a 2018 data breach involving Barracuda Networks, Inc. (through its predecessor Sonian, Inc.) that exposed protected health information (PHI) belonging to patients of Zoll Services LLC, a subsidiary of Zoll Medical Corporation (collectively, Zoll). Zoll is a company that sells medical devices and receives and stores customers\u2019 PHI.\n\nFusion LLC (successor-in-interest to Apptix, Inc.) and Barracuda\u2019s corporate predecessor Sonian, Inc. entered into an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreement. Under the OEM, Fusion was allowed to resell Barracuda\u2019s email archiving services to its own customers. The OEM required Fusion to include specified limitation-of-liability and indemnification provisions in its customer contracts as a condition of the arrangement. The OEM also reserved to Barracuda a contractual right to audit all applicable books and records relating to the services it provided, and contained an anti\u2011waiver clause providing that no failure or delay by Barracuda in exercising any right or remedy under the OEM would operate as a waiver of that right.\n\nAfter the OEM was in place, Zoll became a customer of Fusion, obtaining services for electronic messaging and email communications. The Hosting Agreement between Fusion and Zoll did not include the limitation-of-liability or indemnification provisions that the OEM required Fusion to include in its customer contracts. Separately, Zoll and Fusion entered into a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA). In the BAA, Fusion agreed to use appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI and to ensure that any subcontractor or vendor to whom it provided PHI agreed to the same restrictions and conditions concerning protection of PHI. There is no evidence that Fusion took steps to ensure that Barracuda complied with the BAA\u2019s PHI\u2011protection requirements.\n\nIn 2018, a data breach occurred at Barracuda that exposed HIPAA\u2011protected customer information of Zoll\u2019s patients to an unauthorized third party. After the breach, affected Zoll customers filed a class action lawsuit against Zoll. Zoll settled that class action and assumed responsibility for payment of damages to the class members.\n\nAxis Insurance Company insured Fusion. Through subsequent arbitration and settlement arrangements between Zoll and Fusion, Zoll\u2019s remaining claim against Barracuda (equitable indemnification) and Fusion\u2019s remaining claims (breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing) were assigned to Axis, and Axis was substituted as the plaintiff.",

          "On equitable indemnification, Axis contends that the district court improperly focused on formal labels for the parties\u2019 relationships (such as independent contractor), rather than assessing whether, in light of the factual circumstances, Zoll\u2019s liability to its customers was derivative or vicarious of Barracuda\u2019s conduct. Axis argues that the proper inquiry is whether Zoll was exposed to liability because of Barracuda\u2019s wrongful acts in handling PHI, not whether a traditional, formally recognized relationship (employer\u2013employee, principal\u2013agent, etc.) existed between Zoll and Barracuda. Axis maintains that the facts surrounding the data breach and Zoll\u2019s resulting settlement with its customers support a claim that Zoll\u2019s liability was derivative of Barracuda\u2019s conduct and therefore warrant equitable indemnification.",
          "On the breach of contract claim, Axis accepts that the OEM imposed a condition precedent requiring Fusion to include specified limitation-of-liability and indemnification provisions in its customer contracts and that Fusion\u2019s Hosting Agreement with Zoll did not fully comply. However, Axis argues that Barracuda waived this condition precedent by failing, over a period of years, to exercise its contractual right to audit Fusion\u2019s books and records, including customer contracts, to verify compliance. Axis asserts that Barracuda\u2019s inaction in the face of an audit right amounts to a waiver or, at minimum, creates a fact question for a jury. Axis also contends that summary judgment was improper because waiver issues are generally reserved for the factfinder where the claim is not devoid of reasonable factual support.",
          "As to estoppel, Axis argues in the alternative that Barracuda\u2019s prolonged inaction\u2014its failure to exercise its audit rights or to object to Fusion\u2019s customer contracts\u2014constituted a representation by silence that Fusion was in compliance with the OEM\u2019s condition precedent. Axis maintains that Fusion reasonably relied on Barracuda\u2019s inaction as an indication that its contracts satisfied OEM requirements, and that Fusion suffered detriment when Barracuda later invoked the condition precedent to avoid liability. Axis contends that such facts support equitable estoppel, precluding Barracuda from relying on the unfulfilled condition.",
          "On the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Axis asserts that there is substantial evidence that Barracuda\u2019s conduct in connection with the data breach and its aftermath deprived Fusion of the benefit of its contractual bargain under the OEM. According to Axis, Barracuda failed to properly secure PHI, was slow in providing information about the breach, provided information in a format (JSON) that was effectively unusable or difficult for Zoll\u2019s investigators, interfered with Zoll\u2019s investigation into the cause of the breach, and misrepresented details of the breach. Axis argues that this pattern of conduct undermined Fusion\u2019s ability to perform its obligations to its customers and to protect their PHI, thus frustrating the fruits of Fusion\u2019s OEM relationship with Barracuda and constituting a breach of the implied covenant.",
          "Axis also argues that the district court applied summary judgment standards too rigidly by effectively resolving factual disputes\u2014such as whether Barracuda\u2019s inaction implied waiver or estoppel, and whether its conduct amounted to bad faith\u2014rather than allowing a jury to weigh the evidence and credibility on those contested issues."

Barracuda contends that there was no such relationship between it and Zoll: the only direct contracts were between Barracuda and Fusion (OEM) and between Fusion and Zoll (Hosting Agreement\/BAA). Barracuda maintains that, at most, it was an independent contractor of Fusion, which itself was an independent contractor of Zoll, and that such an attenuated relationship does not support vicarious or derivative liability by Zoll for Barracuda\u2019s acts. Therefore, Barracuda argues, Zoll\u2019s equitable indemnification claim fails as a matter of law.",
          "On the breach of contract claim, Barracuda maintains that the OEM expressly conditioned its obligations on Fusion\u2019s inclusion of specific limitation-of-liability and indemnification provisions in customer contracts. Barracuda points to the district court\u2019s earlier ruling that Fusion failed to satisfy this condition precedent and notes that Axis did not challenge that ruling on appeal. Barracuda argues that, because the condition precedent was not met, the breach of contract claim cannot proceed unless Axis proves that Barracuda clearly waived the condition or is estopped from relying on it.",
          "Regarding waiver, Barracuda contends that its mere failure to exercise an audit right does not constitute the clear, decisive, and unequivocal conduct required to show waiver under Massachusetts law. Barracuda emphasizes that the OEM\u2019s anti\u2011waiver provision expressly states that no failure or delay in exercising contractual rights operates as a waiver, underscoring its intent to preserve the condition precedent. Barracuda asserts that Axis points only to Barracuda\u2019s silence and nonuse of its audit right, without evidence of any affirmative conduct or statement relinquishing the condition, which is insufficient to create a genuine dispute of fact on waiver.",
          "On estoppel, Barracuda argues there was no representation\u2014affirmative or otherwise\u2014intended to induce Fusion\u2019s reliance. The OEM gave Barracuda a right, but not an obligation, to audit. Barracuda maintains that it had no duty to exercise that right or to police Fusion\u2019s customer contracts, and that Fusion remained responsible for ensuring its own compliance with the OEM\u2019s conditions. Accordingly, Barracuda contends that its failure to audit cannot reasonably be viewed as a representation of compliance, and that Fusion could not reasonably rely on silence as assurance that the condition precedent was satisfied.",
          "On the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Barracuda argues that the OEM\u2019s primary purpose was to grant Fusion a non\u2011exclusive license to market and resell Barracuda\u2019s email services. Barracuda contends that the OEM did not provide Fusion with any specific rights or protections in the event of a data breach, and that the implied covenant cannot be invoked to create such rights after the fact or to substitute for Fusion\u2019s failure to negotiate for them. Barracuda further argues that most of the conduct Axis challenges\u2014such as communications with Zoll or alleged interference with Zoll\u2019s investigation\u2014concerns a party (Zoll) with whom Barracuda had no direct contract and thus cannot support a claim that Barracuda acted in bad faith toward Fusion. As to the provision of data in JSON format, Barracuda points to testimony that the format was standard and could be decoded without difficulty, arguing that this does not evidence bad faith or deprivation of Fusion\u2019s contractual fruits.\n      Barracuda maintains that, on the undisputed facts, Axis cannot identify any specific contractual benefit in the OEM that Barracuda allegedly destroyed or impaired, and therefore the implied covenant claim cannot survive summary judgment."

Here, Zoll had no direct contract with Barracuda; the only contractual privity ran (1) OEM: Barracuda\u2013Fusion, and (2) Hosting\/BAA: Fusion\u2013Zoll. At most, Barracuda was an independent contractor to Fusion, which was itself an independent contractor to Zoll\u2014an extra step removed. Zoll\u2019s liability to its customers in the class action arose from its own HIPAA\/PHI obligations and its own contractual and statutory duties to patients, not from any legal rule that imputed Barracuda\u2019s conduct to Zoll via a recognized vicarious-liability relationship. Axis\u2019s argument focuses on the factual causation (Zoll paid because Barracuda\u2019s breach triggered the problem) but does not fit the Massachusetts requirement that liability be legally derivative or vicarious based on a specific type of relationship.

The only remaining questions are waiver and estoppel. Under Massachusetts law, waiver requires a clear, decisive, and unequivocal manifestation of intent to relinquish the right. Barracuda merely did not exercise an audit right. The OEM also contains an anti\u2011waiver clause stating that failure or delay in exercising rights does not constitute a waiver. Given that clause, and absent any affirmative statement or conduct inconsistent with insisting on the condition, inaction cannot reasonably be construed as a clear, unequivocal waiver. On estoppel, there was no duty on Barracuda to audit or police Fusion\u2019s contracts, and thus its silence or inaction cannot be treated as a misleading representation. Estoppel by silence in Massachusetts requires a duty to speak, which is absent here because the audit power was a right, not an obligation. Without evidence of any representation intended to induce reliance, or any reasonable basis for Fusion to treat nonuse of the audit right as an assurance of compliance, there is no triable estoppel claim. Applying de novo review to the summary judgment ruling, the appellate court is likely to hold that no reasonable jury could find waiver or estoppel on these facts, especially in light of the explicit anti\u2011waiver provision, and therefore to affirm."

          "reasoning":"The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in Massachusetts protects only the benefits actually afforded by the contract; it cannot be used to create new substantive obligations. The OEM\u2019s core purpose was to give Fusion a non\u2011exclusive right to resell Barracuda\u2019s services, subject to OEM conditions. Axis does not identify any specific OEM term granting Fusion defined rights in the event of a data breach (e.g., particular security standards, remediation obligations, or cooperation provisions) that Barracuda\u2019s alleged conduct frustrated. Instead, Axis effectively seeks to impose breach\u2011response and security obligations that the contract does not contain. Massachusetts courts routinely reject attempts to use the implied covenant to retrofit unbargained-for protections. Moreover, many of the alleged bad-faith acts relate to Barracuda\u2019s dealings with Zoll, a nonparty to the OEM, further weakening the link to Fusion\u2019s contractual fruits. The provision of data in JSON format, even if inconvenient, does not on these facts amount to bad faith interference with any identified OEM benefit, especially where the record indicates the format was standard and decodable. Because Axis cannot point to a concrete contractual benefit under the OEM that Barracuda, through bad faith, destroyed or impaired, and the facts are largely undisputed, summary judgment on the implied covenant claim is properly granted and should be affirmed."

      "confidence":0.84,
      "reasoning":"All three appealed rulings arise from summary judgment and are reviewed de novo on a largely undisputed factual record. On Issue 1, Massachusetts law on equitable indemnification is narrow and strongly favors the district court\u2019s conclusion that the trilateral arrangement (Barracuda\u2013Fusion\u2013Zoll) did not create the type of vicarious or derivative liability relationship required for common-law indemnity. Axis\u2019s theory emphasizes factual causation rather than the specific, recognized legal relationships that Massachusetts precedent demands, making reversal unlikely. On Issue 2, Axis concedes nonfulfillment of the condition precedent and relies entirely on waiver and estoppel. Massachusetts imposes a high threshold for waiver, and the OEM\u2019s anti\u2011waiver clause, combined with Barracuda\u2019s mere inaction, makes a finding of clear, unequivocal waiver legally unsustainable. Similarly, estoppel cannot rest on silence where there is no duty to speak; the OEM granted Barracuda an audit right, not an audit duty, so Fusion could not reasonably rely on nonuse of that right as an assurance of compliance. On Issue 3, the implied covenant cannot be used to create post hoc data-breach rights where the OEM is silent. Axis does not tie Barracuda\u2019s alleged misconduct to the frustration of any specific OEM right; instead, it seeks to use the covenant as a vehicle for security and breach\u2011response obligations that were not bargained for. Massachusetts courts are clear that the covenant cannot be stretched this way. Given these points, the panel is likely to affirm the district court on all issues, resulting in a complete affirmance."

      "factual_background":"Zoe Hollis is a dancer who worked at Sassy\u2019s, a Portland, Oregon strip club, approximately three to five times per week from June 2017 until March 2019. Hollis\u2019s work at Sassy\u2019s was governed by a written contract that purported to classify them as an independent contractor rather than an employee.\n\nNo special training, licenses, experience, or skills were required for dancers at Sassy\u2019s, although dancers, including Hollis, briefly auditioned for a manager. A manager provided Hollis with a weekly schedule each Sunday, based in part on the dancers\u2019 stated interest and availability. Hollis was allowed to and did work for other clubs for a couple of months during this same general period.\n\nSassy\u2019s controlled various aspects of club operations and the dancers\u2019 work. It controlled customer entry, set minimum prices for dances, required dancers to rotate between the stage and the floor, and hired and managed DJs, bartenders, and bouncers. Sassy\u2019s controlled the music, although when a DJ was not present Hollis and other dancers could choose from a pre-approved list of songs. Sassy\u2019s required dancers on stage to remove their clothing in a specified order across three songs (teasing during the first, removing tops during the second, and removing bottoms during the third). Sassy\u2019s set minimum prices dancers could charge for certain dances and required customers to tip at least one dollar to dancers on stage, although this one-dollar minimum was not always enforced.\n\nHollis\u2019s labor at Sassy\u2019s was subject to an extensive set of rules, violations of which could result in termination. Dancers had to maintain their hair, makeup, and physical appearance to certain standards. Hollis\u2019s schedule was reduced after they chose to wear their natural hair instead of a wig. Other rules addressed how dancers could interact with customers, requiring that disputes or issues be handled only by security or bar staff. Dancers also had to follow rules regarding money handling, such as keeping one-dollar bills in bundles of twenty.\n\nHollis was required to pay a per-shift \"house fee\" to Sassy\u2019s for each shift worked. Hollis and other dancers also tipped the bartenders, DJs, and bouncers; Hollis reported that these workers would make working at the club \"miserable\" if they were not tipped. Hollis was not responsible for paying for the club\u2019s dance poles, facilities, utilities, advertising, or other business expenses, and Hollis had no management responsibilities at Sassy\u2019s.\n\nSeparately from Sassy\u2019s, Hollis performed twice as a pole dancer at a weekly variety show called \"Sinferno Cabaret\" hosted at Dante\u2019s, another adult entertainment club in Portland. On June 22, 2021, Hollis received an email confirming their scheduled slot to perform at Dante\u2019s for a third time on July 25, 2021. The same email solicited Hollis\u2019s requests for additional future performance slots at Dante\u2019s.\n\nSix days after that scheduling email, Hollis filed a lawsuit concerning their work at Sassy\u2019s. At that time, R&R Restaurants, Inc. operated Sassy\u2019s. Stacy Mayhood and Ian Hannigan were owner-managers of Sassy\u2019s. Frank Faillace was a partner and manager of both Sassy\u2019s and Dante\u2019s.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, after the Sassy\u2019s lawsuit had been filed, Faillace emailed Hollis to cancel the July 25 scheduled performance at Dante\u2019s. In that email, he reminded Hollis that he was one of the partners in Sassy\u2019s and referenced that Sassy\u2019s had recently been served with a class action lawsuit in which Hollis was the primary plaintiff. He described the lawsuit as involving the issue of dancers being classified as employees versus independent contractors, and he stated that, because Hollis would be performing at Dante\u2019s as an independent contractor, allowing Hollis to perform at Dante\u2019s would place that business at risk for a similar lawsuit. He stated that he and his partners had been strongly advised not to have Hollis perform at Dante\u2019s for this reason. The email further asserted that the cancellation was not due to Hollis\u2019s activism concerning racial and cultural bias in strip clubs, and that he shared many of Hollis\u2019s goals, but disagreed with them about the employee versus independent contractor issue. He characterized the Sassy\u2019s lawsuit as serious and noted that the legal bills could potentially put Sassy\u2019s or other clubs out of business, and he expressed regret that Hollis would not be able to perform at Dante\u2019s and that the situation had developed as it had.\n\nAfter receiving this email, Hollis understood that they were barred from the scheduled appearance and from future performance opportunities at Dante\u2019s.

        "claims_brought":"On June 28, 2021 (six days after the Dante\u2019s scheduling email), Hollis filed a collective action under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon against R&R Restaurants, Inc. (operator of Sassy\u2019s), and against Sassy\u2019s owner-managers Stacy Mayhood and Ian Hannigan. The complaint alleged that Sassy\u2019s misclassified its dancers, including Hollis, as independent contractors rather than employees, in order to avoid paying minimum wage and overtime under the FLSA. It also alleged that defendants took unlawful 'kickbacks' in the form of mandatory house fees and unlawfully retained dancers\u2019 tips, asserting violations of FLSA wage-and-hour and tip provisions.\n\nAfter receiving the July 19, 2021 cancellation email from Faillace regarding Dante\u2019s, Hollis filed a First Amended Complaint. The FAC added Faillace as a defendant to the misclassification and wage-related claims concerning Sassy\u2019s. The FAC further added a claim that Faillace\u2019s cancellation of Hollis\u2019s scheduled performance at Dante\u2019s and barring of Hollis from future performances there constituted unlawful retaliation in violation of the FLSA. The FAC also asserted parallel retaliation claims under Oregon state law based on the same conduct.",
        "district_court_decision":"The defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court initially held the motion in abeyance to address discovery disputes, and the defendants then filed a renewed motion for summary judgment.\n\nOn November 2, 2023, a magistrate judge issued Findings and Recommendations concerning the renewed summary judgment motion. The magistrate judge concluded that Hollis\u2019s wage-related FLSA claims, including misclassification, minimum wage, overtime, house fee, and tip-retention allegations, were barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The magistrate judge further concluded that Hollis\u2019s FLSA retaliation claim based on Faillace\u2019s cancellation of the Dante\u2019s performance was timely, but that the claim failed as a matter of law because it was undisputed that Hollis was not an employee of Dante\u2019s or of Faillace at the time of the alleged retaliatory conduct. On that basis, the magistrate judge recommended granting summary judgment on the FLSA retaliation claim. Because this would leave no remaining federal claims, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing the Oregon state-law retaliation claims without prejudice for lack of supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nOn March 26, 2024, the district judge adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations in full and granted the defendants\u2019 renewed motion for summary judgment. The district court agreed that Hollis\u2019s FLSA wage and hour claims were time-barred and that Hollis could not maintain an FLSA retaliation claim without establishing that they were an employee of Dante\u2019s at the time of the alleged retaliation. The court also dismissed the state-law retaliation claims without prejudice.",

Hollis does not appeal the district court\u2019s determination that the wage-related FLSA claims are time-barred or the dismissal of those claims. The appeal focuses on whether an FLSA plaintiff must have been an employee of the alleged retaliator (here, Dante\u2019s\/Faillace in his Dante\u2019s capacity) at the time of the retaliatory act in order to maintain a private civil action for retaliation, and whether Hollis can pursue an FLSA retaliation claim based on the employment relationship with Sassy\u2019s and Faillace\u2019s conduct in canceling contract work at Dante\u2019s."

Under the statutory definition and Ninth Circuit precedent (including Arias v. Raimondo), the FLSA allows a private retaliation claim against any 'employer' as defined in \u00a7 203(d), which includes persons acting directly or indirectly in the interest of the actual employer, and does not limit liability to current employers or require that the retaliator be the direct employer at the time of the act.",
          "Hollis\u2019s employment relationship at issue for the FLSA retaliation claim is the relationship with Sassy\u2019s, not Dante\u2019s. The protected activity was Hollis\u2019s filing of the FLSA wage-and-hour lawsuit against Sassy\u2019s. Faillace was a partner and manager in Sassy\u2019s and therefore an 'employer' of Hollis within the meaning of the FLSA if Hollis is deemed an employee under the economic realities test. His conduct in cancelling the Dante\u2019s engagement because of the Sassy\u2019s lawsuit constituted action 'indirectly in the interest' of Sassy\u2019s in relation to Hollis.",
          "The fact that Hollis\u2019s underlying wage and misclassification claims are time-barred does not extinguish Hollis\u2019s status as an 'employee' under the FLSA. The statute does not require a plaintiff to prevail on, or even maintain, a viable misclassification or wage claim as a prerequisite to asserting retaliation, and the anti-retaliation provision explicitly protects the mere 'filing' of a complaint, which can be informal and need not succeed on the merits. Statutes of limitation that bar wage claims for damages do not prevent a plaintiff from establishing the factual existence of an earlier employment relationship for purposes of a timely retaliation claim.",
          "Under the economic realities test, Hollis contends that they were, in fact, an employee of Sassy\u2019s. Sassy\u2019s controlled significant aspects of the work (scheduling, rotation, dress and appearance, performance choreography, music, pricing, and tipping rules); required house fees; imposed detailed rules; and provided the facilities and support staff, indicating economic dependence and an employment relationship despite the independent-contractor label in Hollis\u2019s contract.",
          "Faillace\u2019s cancellation of the Dante\u2019s performance and his stated refusal to allow Hollis to perform there in the future constitute adverse actions that could dissuade a reasonable worker from filing or maintaining an FLSA complaint. The cancellation cut off an income source and future work opportunities and was expressly linked to Hollis\u2019s lawsuit against Sassy\u2019s in the email. Such conduct falls within the FLSA\u2019s prohibition on 'discharg[ing] or in any other manner discriminat[ing]' because an employee filed an FLSA-related complaint.",

Allowing employers or related business owners to defend such actions as legitimate risk-avoidance decisions would undermine the FLSA\u2019s anti-retaliation protections, as adverse actions taken in response to protected complaints will almost always relate to concerns about legal exposure."

Because Hollis was not an employee of Dante\u2019s, and had never been a traditional employee of Dante\u2019s or of Faillace in relation to Dante\u2019s work, Hollis cannot maintain an FLSA retaliation claim based on the cancellation of a performance there.",

The expiration of those claims means Hollis cannot demonstrate a current, cognizable employment relationship with Sassy\u2019s for purposes of the retaliation claim, and the court should not permit a plaintiff to revive otherwise stale employment relationships by repackaging them as retaliation claims.",

Therefore, even if he was an 'employer' with respect to Sassy\u2019s, he was not acting as Sassy\u2019s agent in cancelling the Dante\u2019s performance. The FLSA\u2019s 'acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer' language should require at least an agency-type relationship or direct benefit to the actual employer, which is absent here.",
          "The cancellation of a single scheduled performance and the decision not to enter into future independent-contractor engagements with Hollis at Dante\u2019s were legitimate business judgments made to protect Dante\u2019s from exposure to potential litigation over its own classification and compensation practices. Hollis would have been performing at Dante\u2019s as an independent contractor under terms distinct from their engagement with Sassy\u2019s, and the decision not to proceed with that arrangement was a reasonable protective measure in light of the pending lawsuit against Sassy\u2019s.",
          "The fact that Hollis continued to be allowed to provide trainings for Dante\u2019s and other clubs operated by Faillace undermines the claim that the cancellation was retaliatory and shows that Dante\u2019s and Faillace did not seek to broadly punish Hollis for filing the lawsuit. Instead, the specific performance arrangement that most directly implicated potential independent-contractor classification risk was discontinued.",
          "Not every adverse effect on a plaintiff\u2019s opportunities following protected activity constitutes retaliation under the FLSA. The statutory scheme, defendants argue, should not be interpreted to penalize defendants for taking steps reasonably calculated to minimize future liability and business risk, particularly where no existing employment relationship exists between the plaintiff and the entity taking the adverse action."

In Arias v. Raimondo, the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected a narrow, current\u2011employer\u2011only reading of these provisions, holding that an attorney for the employer\u2014who never directly employed the plaintiff\u2014could be liable for FLSA retaliation. Arias also emphasized that retaliation can occur after the employment relationship ends and can be carried out by non\u2011employers so long as they fit the broad statutory definition. The district court\u2019s requirement that Hollis be an employee of Dante\u2019s (or of Faillace in his Dante\u2019s capacity) at the time of the adverse action conflicts with Arias\u2019s interpretation and with the statutory text, which focuses on whether the defendant is an 'employer' in relation to the employee\u2019s FLSA\u2011protected activity, not whether the defendant is the current direct employer in the specific setting where the adverse act occurred. On this record, Faillace was a partner\/manager of Sassy\u2019s\u2014the entity sued in the FLSA action\u2014and thus acts 'directly or indirectly in the interest' of Sassy\u2019s in relation to Hollis. That he used his authority at another club (Dante\u2019s) to penalize Hollis because Hollis filed an FLSA lawsuit against Sassy\u2019s does not take the conduct outside \u00a7 215(a)(3). Under Arias and the statutory definitions, the district court erred as a matter of law in holding that a retaliation claim is categorically unavailable absent an employment relationship with the alleged retaliator (Dante\u2019s) at the time of the act."

Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 203, 215(a)(3), or 216(b) requires that the plaintiff have a timely or successful wage\u2011and\u2011hour claim as a prerequisite to retaliation protection. Statutes of limitation extinguish the remedy on the underlying wage claim; they do not erase the historical fact of an employment relationship for purposes of a separate, timely retaliation claim. Courts routinely allow retaliation claims to proceed even when the underlying merits claim fails. Thus, Hollis need not first succeed on, or even be able to litigate, the misclassification\/minimum\u2011wage claims to be an 'employee' protected by \u00a7 215(a)(3). The proper question is whether, under the economic realities test, Hollis was in fact an 'employee' of Sassy\u2019s when they worked there. The summary\u2011judgment record\u2014Sassy\u2019s extensive control over schedule, choreography, appearance, house rules, pricing, and the provision of facilities and staff\u2014strongly supports employee status, but at the least it raises a genuine dispute of material fact that cannot be resolved against Hollis as a matter of law. The limitations bar on the wage claims does not preclude Hollis from establishing an employment relationship with Sassy\u2019s for the retaliation claim, and the district court erred in effectively conditioning retaliation protection on the ability to bring timely wage claims."

Following Burlington Northern\u2019s materially\u2011adverse standard, an action is retaliatory if it could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting an FLSA complaint. Canceling a scheduled paid performance and barring the plaintiff from future performances at a prominent venue is a textbook adverse action: it cuts off an income stream and future opportunities. The email from Faillace makes the causal link explicit: he cancelled because Hollis filed an FLSA misclassification lawsuit against Sassy\u2019s and he feared a similar suit at Dante\u2019s. Eliminating work opportunities specifically because a worker invoked FLSA rights is retaliation, even if framed as 'risk management.' Concern about further litigation arising from the protected activity cannot be a legitimate non\u2011retaliatory reason; it simply restates the retaliatory motive in business terms. At summary judgment, with this direct evidence of retaliatory causation, a reasonable jury could find that the cancellation and bar were materially adverse actions taken 'because' of protected activity. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the conduct was non\u2011actionable (or justified as a matter of law) was erroneous; the question should go to a jury."

The district court disposed of it on legal grounds that conflict with the statutory text and controlling Ninth Circuit precedent, particularly Arias v. Raimondo. First, the court improperly required Hollis to be an employee of Dante\u2019s at the time of the retaliation, instead of asking whether Faillace qualifies as an 'employer' under the FLSA in relation to Hollis\u2019s work at Sassy\u2019s and whether he retaliated 'because' of Hollis\u2019s protected filing. Arias makes clear that retaliation liability is not limited to the current direct employer or to the same worksite where the adverse act occurs. Second, the court effectively conditioned retaliation protection on the viability of underlying wage claims, contrary to the principle that the FLSA protects the filing of complaints regardless of their success and that statutes of limitation on wage claims do not erase the existence of the prior employment relationship. Third, the summary\u2011judgment record contains undisputed evidence of an adverse action (cancellation and blacklisting from future performances) and explicit evidence of retaliatory motive tied to Hollis\u2019s FLSA lawsuit. Put together, these points strongly indicate the Ninth Circuit would reverse the grant of summary judgment on the retaliation claim and remand for further proceedings, leaving the unappealed time\u2011bar ruling on the wage\u2011and\u2011hour claims undisturbed."

      },
      "factual_background":"According to the amended complaint, the thirty named plaintiffs are survivors of childhood sexual abuse that occurred between the 1960s and the 1990s in multiple Catholic dioceses in New York State, including the Archdiocese of New York and the Dioceses of Brooklyn, Rockville Centre, Albany, Syracuse, and Ogdensburg. They allege that they were sexually abused as children by specific priests or deacons who were assigned to the parishes, churches, or schools they attended. These clerics were alleged to have had access to the plaintiffs because bishops or archbishops assigned them to positions where they could interact with children, despite knowledge or suspicion of the clerics\u2019 prior or ongoing sexual misconduct.\n\nThe Holy See is described as the universal government of the Catholic Church, operating from Vatican City State, a recognized foreign sovereign. The Catholic Church is organized territorially into dioceses and archdioceses; each diocese is headed by a bishop and an archdiocese by an archbishop. Bishops and archbishops (collectively, bishops) supervise priests and other clerics within their territories and conduct local church activities. The complaint alleges that bishops in the United States, including those administering the New York dioceses, act under the direction and complete, plenary control of the Holy See, and that they are employees of the Holy See for purposes of vicarious liability.\n\nCentral to the plaintiffs\u2019 theory is what they describe as a mandatory secrecy policy allegedly promulgated by the Holy See about a century ago in a confidential document titled \"Instruction on the Manner of Proceeding in Cases of Solicitation\" or \"Crimen Sollicitationis.\" This policy was first issued in 1922 and, according to the complaint, was reiterated or renewed in subsequent ecclesiastical documents issued in 1962, 2001, and 2010. The Policy allegedly established specific internal procedures for investigating and responding to allegations and reports of sexual abuse, including child sexual abuse, within the Church. It is alleged to have imposed strict secrecy on all persons involved in such proceedings, under penalty of excommunication, and to have prohibited disclosure of allegations outside defined internal channels.\n\nAs relevant to this case, the plaintiffs allege that the Policy required bishops not to disclose allegations of clergy sexual abuse to civil law enforcement authorities, to instruct victims and their families not to report the abuse to law enforcement, and not to provide warnings or disclosures to parishioners or school communities that might protect children by revealing an accused cleric\u2019s history or risk. The plaintiffs contend that the Policy, as implemented, \"emboldened sexual predators\" among the clergy, fostered an environment in which clergy could abuse children \"with impunity,\" and placed children in the affected dioceses at a foreseeable risk of harm.\n\nThe plaintiffs further allege that the bishops in the New York dioceses, in compliance with the Holy See\u2019s secrecy Policy, failed to warn children, parents, and parish communities about clergy who were known or suspected abusers; failed to report suspected abuse to law enforcement; and nonetheless continued to assign, or reassign, these priests and deacons to positions in parishes, schools, or other settings where they had access to children. The plaintiffs assert that the harm they suffered resulted from these failures to warn and report, combined with the discretionary assignment of abusive clerics to roles where they could continue to abuse. They contend that the Holy See, through its mandatory Policy and through its employment relationship with the bishops, bears vicarious liability in negligence for these actions and omissions. The complaint also alleges that in December 2019 Pope Francis issued a directive reversing or modifying the prior secrecy regime by stating that persons reporting the crime of child sexual abuse would not be bound by an obligation of silence, which plaintiffs cite as evidence of the existence and subsequent change of the underlying Policy.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In May 2020, the plaintiffs filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Holy See. They sought money damages for personal injuries arising from childhood sexual abuse, asserting state-law negligence claims under a vicarious liability theory. The core theory was that the Holy See, as a foreign state, is vicariously liable for the negligent acts and omissions of its alleged employees, the bishops who administered the New York dioceses, in failing to warn and protect children and in failing to report known or suspected abuse to law enforcement, and in assigning abusive clerics to positions with access to children. The complaint invoked the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) tortious activity exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(5), as the jurisdictional basis for suing a foreign sovereign, and alleged that the Holy See\u2019s immunity was abrogated by that exception.",
        "district_court_decision":"After the Holy See moved to dismiss the original complaint, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The Holy See moved again to dismiss on multiple grounds, including lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA, lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue, and failure to state a claim. In September 2022, the district court (Judge Oetken) granted the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA.\n\nThe district court first addressed plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to base liability on the conduct of the New York dioceses. It noted that the dioceses are New York corporations organized under state law and therefore possess a separate juridical status from the Holy See, which is the foreign sovereign. Relying on First Nat\u2019l City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba (Bancec) and related precedent, the court held that plaintiffs had not alleged facts sufficient to overcome the \"strong presumption\" that instrumentalities of a foreign state have a legal status independent from the foreign state itself. On that basis, it concluded that, with respect to claims premised on the dioceses\u2019 own tortious conduct, the Holy See was effectively the wrong defendant.\n\nThe district court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 alternative argument that common-law agency principles could overcome the Bancec presumption and permit vicarious liability for the dioceses\u2019 conduct. It reasoned that the FSIA\u2019s tortious activity exception is limited by its plain text to tortious acts or omissions by the \"foreign state\" or by an \"official or employee\" of that state, and that agents, as such, are not encompassed in this language. The court therefore held that the Holy See could not be held vicariously liable under the FSIA for tortious conduct attributed to the dioceses as separate juridical entities.\n\nThe court then turned to claims based on the conduct of the individual bishops administering the New York dioceses. It determined, applying New York law, that the bishops could be considered employees of the Holy See. It further found that in handling allegations of abuse\u2014specifically, in deciding whether or how to report accusations and in assigning or supervising clergy\u2014the bishops were acting within the scope of their employment. On this basis, the court held that the Holy See could, in principle, be vicariously liable for the bishops\u2019 conduct.\n\nNext, the court examined whether the FSIA\u2019s tortious activity exception applied, including its \"entire tort\" requirement, which requires that the whole of the tort occur within the United States. The district court concluded that this requirement was satisfied because plaintiffs\u2019 theory focused on local implementation of the Holy See\u2019s secrecy Policy by bishops within the United States: the alleged failures to warn parishioners and to report suspected or actual abuse by clergy in New York, and the assignment of accused clerics to positions there. The court found that the amended complaint contained sufficient, well-pleaded allegations of sexual abuse traceable to alleged negligence by supervising clergy and the archbishop. It therefore held that the FSIA\u2019s tortious activity exception would, in the first instance, cover the claims insofar as they were based on the conduct of the bishops.\n\nHowever, the district court went on to analyze the FSIA\u2019s discretionary function exclusion, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(5)(A), which removes from the tortious activity exception any claim based upon the exercise or performance, or the failure to exercise or perform, a discretionary function. Applying the Berkovitz\/Gaubert framework (borrowed from FTCA jurisprudence), the court found that the challenged conduct of the bishops involved discretionary acts because decisions about how to run a diocese, how to supervise clergy, and whether and how to warn parishioners or report allegations involved judgment and choice. It further concluded that the bishops\u2019 decisions regarding whether to warn about an individual\u2019s dangerous proclivities or to notify parishioners and authorities were the type of discretionary judgments that are susceptible to policy analysis and thus fall within the discretionary function exclusion. On that basis, the court held that, although the tortious activity exception would otherwise apply to the bishops\u2019 actions, the discretionary function exclusion reinstated the Holy See\u2019s immunity and deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction.",
        "what_is_appealed":"The plaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing their suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. On appeal, they challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that their claims\u2014alleging that bishops, as Holy See employees, engaged in tortious conduct when implementing the Holy See\u2019s alleged mandatory secrecy Policy regarding clergy sexual abuse\u2014are barred by the FSIA\u2019s discretionary function exclusion. They do not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s separate ruling that the Holy See cannot be held vicariously liable, under the FSIA, for the independent conduct of the New York dioceses as juridically separate entities."

The discretionary function exclusion in \u00a7 1605(a)(5)(A) removes from this exception any claim 'based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused.' Courts apply the two-prong Berkovitz\/Gaubert test, developed in the FTCA context and imported to FSIA cases: (1) the challenged act must involve discretion, meaning an element of judgment or choice and not be compelled by a specific, mandatory directive; and (2) the judgment or choice must be grounded in considerations of public policy or be susceptible to policy analysis. The party seeking to establish jurisdiction bears the initial burden of producing evidence that a specific FSIA exception applies, while the foreign state has the ultimate burden of persuasion on immunity."

          "The plaintiffs contend that the district court misapplied the discretionary function exclusion. They argue that the bishops\u2019 challenged conduct\u2014the failure to warn parishioners and parents, the failure to report suspected abuse to law enforcement, and the handling of abuse allegations\u2014did not involve meaningful discretion because it was compelled by the Holy See\u2019s mandatory secrecy Policy. Under their reading of the Berkovitz\/Gaubert framework, where a specific, mandatory directive exists and allegedly compels the employee\u2019s conduct, there is no room for the employee\u2019s own judgment or choice, and the discretionary function exclusion should not apply.",
          "They argue that, in this context, the presence of the Holy See\u2019s detailed Policy itself satisfies the first Berkovitz\/Gaubert prong in their favor: because the bishops\u2019 actions were purportedly taken pursuant to that mandatory Policy, the acts were not discretionary and thus fall outside the exclusion. They emphasize language in Berkovitz suggesting that the discretionary function exception does not apply when a statute, regulation, or policy \"specifically prescribes a course of action\" for an employee to follow, and they contend this principle should extend to FSIA cases involving compliance with a foreign sovereign\u2019s mandatory policy.",
          "Plaintiffs further assert that the district court\u2019s reliance on FTCA jurisprudence is incomplete and that important language in the FTCA\u2014specifically, the 'due care' component of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a)\u2014has no counterpart in the FSIA. They argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in Gaubert that the government is protected when an employee obeys a mandatory regulation rested in part on this 'due care' clause. Because the FSIA does not contain an analogous due care provision, they argue, foreign states should not receive immunity for claims based on employees\u2019 compliance with mandatory policies.",
          "As to the second Berkovitz\/Gaubert prong, plaintiffs argue that there can be no legitimate policy basis for a regime of strict secrecy surrounding the criminal sexual abuse of children. They contend that shielding such illegal conduct from disclosure, instructing victims and families not to report, and leaving accused abusers in positions of authority over children cannot reasonably be characterized as discretionary policy judgments grounded in social, economic, or political considerations. They point to case law (such as Tonelli v. United States) suggesting that negligent supervision in the face of known ongoing illegal activity is not protected by the discretionary function principle.",
          "Plaintiffs also maintain that their claims should be understood as challenging operational negligence\u2014local failures by bishops to protect children\u2014rather than high-level policy decisions of the Holy See itself. They argue that the alleged acts and omissions at issue (failure to warn, failure to report, assignment of known or suspected abusers) are not the kind of policy-driven planning-level decisions that the discretionary function exclusion is designed to shield from judicial review."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "The Holy See argues that the district court correctly concluded that the FSIA\u2019s discretionary function exclusion bars jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on the bishops\u2019 conduct. It asserts that the decisions challenged by plaintiffs\u2014how to handle allegations of clergy sexual abuse, whether and how to inform parishioners or civil authorities, and how to assign or reassign suspected clerics\u2014are inherently discretionary. These decisions involve the exercise of judgment and choice by bishops within the Church\u2019s hierarchical structure and, therefore, satisfy the first prong of the Berkovitz\/Gaubert test.",
          "The Holy See contends that even accepting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that the bishops were following a mandatory secrecy Policy promulgated by the Holy See, compliance with such a Policy does not remove their actions from the scope of the discretionary function exclusion. Citing Gaubert and related FTCA precedent, the Holy See argues that when employees act in accordance with a mandatory directive that itself reflects policy choices, their conduct is still treated as discretionary for purposes of the exception, because it implements the sovereign\u2019s policy decisions.",
          "The Holy See further asserts that the challenged conduct meets the second Berkovitz\/Gaubert prong because it is susceptible to policy analysis. It maintains that the Holy See\u2019s Policy on handling abuse allegations and the bishops\u2019 implementation of that Policy required balancing multiple considerations, including the spiritual and emotional well-being of parishioners, the confidentiality of internal ecclesiastical proceedings, the reputation of the Church and individual clerics, the stability and staffing needs of parishes and dioceses, and other pastoral and institutional concerns. According to the Holy See, such balancing of safety, confidentiality, reputational, and resource allocation considerations is quintessentially the kind of policymaking judgment that the discretionary function exclusion is designed to shield from tort-based judicial second-guessing.",
          "The Holy See also maintains that FTCA jurisprudence concerning the discretionary function exception should guide the interpretation of the FSIA\u2019s parallel exclusion, given the nearly identical statutory language and the legislative history indicating Congress\u2019s intent to align the treatment of domestic and foreign sovereigns. It argues that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed distinction\u2014denying immunity for foreign sovereigns where employees comply with mandatory policies\u2014would conflict with this intent and with comity principles, by exposing foreign sovereigns to suits in circumstances where the United States itself would remain immune.",
          "In addition to its discretionary function arguments, the Holy See asserts alternative grounds in support of dismissal (though not necessary to the district court\u2019s decision), including that plaintiffs did not satisfy the FSIA\u2019s 'entire tort' requirement and that the causal link between the bishops\u2019 alleged conduct and plaintiffs\u2019 injuries is insufficiently pleaded, and it also invokes the FSIA\u2019s misrepresentation exclusion. These arguments are offered as additional reasons why FSIA jurisdiction should not be found."

          "reasoning":"The question whether the FSIA\u2019s discretionary function exclusion applies is a legal issue reviewed de novo. The district court assumed, in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, that: (1) the bishops were Holy See employees acting within the scope of employment; (2) the entire tort occurred in the United States; and (3) the alleged conduct would otherwise fall within \u00a7 1605(a)(5). It then held that the discretionary function exclusion, \u00a7 1605(a)(5)(A), restored immunity.\n\nUnder the Berkovitz\/Gaubert framework, the first prong asks whether the challenged conduct involves judgment or choice, i.e., whether it is not compelled by a specific mandatory directive. The plaintiffs\u2019 core move on appeal is to treat the Holy See\u2019s alleged secrecy Policy itself as the mandatory directive that eliminated all discretion at the bishop level, so that their acts could not be characterized as discretionary. But that argument misunderstands how the FTCA\/FSIA discretionary function analysis works. The relevant question is whether the conduct the plaintiffs are actually suing over\u2014how to respond to abuse allegations, what to disclose to parishioners or law enforcement, and whether and where to assign particular clerics\u2014was an exercise of judgment implementing ecclesiastical and institutional policy, not whether some higher-level sovereign policy exists.\n\nEven accepting plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations about the Policy as true at the Rule 12 stage, there is no indication that the Policy prescribed a single, ministerial course of action in each specific case (e.g., a rote checklist that left no room for judgment). It is about how, within the Church\u2019s internal legal system, allegations are processed and kept confidential. Decisions whether, when, and to what extent to warn parishioners; what investigatory steps to take; how to weigh unproven allegations; and how to staff parishes remain matters of judgment and choice for bishops, and thus satisfy Berkovitz\u2019s first prong. FTCA case law routinely treats supervision, investigation, and allocation-of-resources decisions as discretionary, even when they occur within the framework of high-level mandatory policies.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attempt to distinguish FSIA from FTCA based on the absence of the FTCA\u2019s \u201cdue care\u201d clause fails. The discretionary function exclusion in \u00a7 1605(a)(5)(A) is worded in essentially the same way as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a)\u2019s discretionary function language, and courts (including the Supreme Court) have long looked to FTCA jurisprudence, particularly Berkovitz and Gaubert, to construe \u00a7 1605(a)(5)(A). The \u2018due care\u2019 clause in \u00a7 2680(a) concerns a separate category of immunity and does not limit the reach of the discretionary function clause. There is no basis in text or precedent to read FSIA\u2019s discretionary function exclusion more narrowly, or to deprive foreign states of immunity in circumstances where the United States itself would be protected.\n\nOn the second prong, plaintiffs argue that there can be no legitimate policy basis for concealing child sexual abuse and leaving known abusers in positions of authority over children, and they invoke cases suggesting that negligent supervision in the face of illegal conduct is not protected. But Gaubert makes clear that the focus is on whether the type of decision is susceptible to policy analysis\u2014not on whether the particular policy choices were wise, moral, or even lawful. Decisions about internal disciplinary procedures, how to handle accusations, how to balance confidentiality, protection of reputations, pastoral concerns, institutional stability, and safety are exactly the kinds of decisions that, in the abstract, involve the weighing of social, moral, reputational, and resource considerations. That susceptibility to policy analysis is enough; courts do not second-guess the merits of those policy choices in applying the discretionary function exclusion.\n\nNor can plaintiffs recast what they challenge as merely \u2018operational negligence\u2019 at a low level. Their theory expressly targets the Holy See\u2019s alleged secrecy Policy and the bishops\u2019 implementation of it across multiple dioceses over decades\u2014precisely the sort of institutional, judgment-laden decision-making that Gaubert characterizes as protected. The bishops were not engaged in a purely mechanical, ministerial task like following a traffic signal or a fixed checklist.\n\nIn light of the close textual parallel between FTCA and FSIA, the weight of precedent extending Gaubert to FSIA \u00a7 1605(a)(5)(A), and the inherently judgment-based nature of how ecclesiastical leaders respond to and manage allegations against clergy, the Holy See\u2019s position is more consistent with governing law. The district court correctly concluded that the claims are \u2018based upon\u2019 the exercise or failure to exercise discretionary functions of the bishops implementing church policy and thus fall within the FSIA\u2019s discretionary function exclusion. Accordingly, dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be affirmed."

      "confidence":0.76,
      "reasoning":"There is a single dispositive legal issue on appeal: whether the FSIA\u2019s discretionary function exclusion strips jurisdiction despite the tortious activity exception. The applicable standard is de novo. Current doctrine strongly favors importing FTCA discretionary function analysis to FSIA, reading \u00a7 1605(a)(5)(A) in lockstep with \u00a7 2680(a). Under Berkovitz\/Gaubert as applied in both FTCA and FSIA cases, supervision, investigation, reporting decisions, and assignment of personnel are paradigmatic discretionary functions, even when exercised poorly or wrongfully, provided they are not dictated by a highly specific mandatory rule.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory\u2014that any mandatory sovereign policy automatically eliminates \u2018discretion\u2019 for subordinates and thus negates the exclusion\u2014collides with Gaubert\u2019s treatment of decisions implementing mandatory policy as still shielded when the underlying policy is itself discretionary. Their further attempt to limit FSIA immunity based on the absence of the FTCA\u2019s \u2018due care\u2019 clause is not supported by statutory text or precedent and would create asymmetry between domestic and foreign sovereign immunity contrary to Congress\u2019s evident purpose.\n\nAlthough the underlying conduct alleged is grave, the legal framework of FSIA, as interpreted in parallel with the FTCA, points toward characterizing the bishops\u2019 actions and omissions as discretionary and grounded in policy-type considerations. Because plaintiffs narrowed the appeal to this single issue and did not challenge the separate ruling on diocesan liability, affirmance of the jurisdictional dismissal is the most probable outcome."

      },
      "factual_background":"Xerox Corporation and Local 14A, Rochester Regional Joint Board, Xerographic Division Workers United had been parties to successive collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) for decades. Their most recent CBA, referred to as the 2018\u201321 CBA, became effective on June 11, 2018. By its terms, it was to remain in effect until September 30, 2021, and then from year to year unless either party gave written notice of an intent to change or terminate the agreement. The parties later agreed to extend the agreement through November 30, 2021. No successor CBA has been negotiated since that expiration.\n\nThe 2018\u201321 CBA was broad in scope and addressed hours of work, wages, benefits, strikes, layoffs, seniority, retirement, grievance procedures, and temporary layoffs, among other subjects. It contained a multi\u2011step grievance procedure under which unresolved grievances progressed through three steps of meetings and written communications, culminating in arbitration at Step 4 if the grievance was not satisfactorily resolved at Step 3 and the Union timely appealed to arbitration.\n\nRetirement and retiree benefits were addressed in Schedule H of the 2018\u201321 CBA. Schedule H described four benefit types for retirees and their dependents: Life Insurance, the Medical Care Plan, the Dental Plan, and a Flexible Benefit Account. It set out specific dollar amounts for deductibles, out\u2011of\u2011pocket maximums, allowances, and eligibility rules, including rules for employees who had not yet retired as well as for individuals who had retired in earlier years. Schedule H stated that it was an outline only, and that the benefits described were subject to the detailed terms and conditions of the actual benefit plans or contracts and to applicable state and federal law.\n\nFor retiree medical coverage, Schedule H identified three categories of coverage: (1) employees who reached retirement eligibility before 1989 would receive coverage as described in the 1980\u201383 Labor Agreement; (2) employees not retirement\u2011eligible before 1989 who retired between 1989 and 1994 would receive coverage as described in the 1989\u201392 Labor Agreement, with certain modifications; and (3) employees not retirement\u2011eligible before 1989 who retired after 1994 would receive a \"Benefits Allowance.\" These three coverage categories corresponded to three plans: the Xerox Medical Care Plan for Retired Employees (\"Old Plan\"), the Xerox Retiree Health Care Plan (\"New Plan\"), and the Xerox Corporation Retiree Health Reimbursement Account Plan (\"HRA Flex Plan\" or \"HRA Plan\"). This three\u2011plan structure had been in place for decades and was carried forward through successive CBAs.\n\nThe most recent plan documents in the record are 2016 \"Amendment and Restatement\" documents for each of the three plans. The parties agree that these 2016 restated plan documents were incorporated by reference into the CBA via Schedule H. Under the 2016 restatements of the Old Plan and New Plan, retirees and eligible dependents would continue participating in their respective medical plans until the earlier of the retiree ceasing to pay required contributions or ceasing to be a retiree. The documents also provided that, if a retiree died while a participant in the plan, the retiree's eligible dependent spouse or domestic partner, if that person continued to pay contributions, would continue as a participant in the plan until his or her death. The 2016 restatements for the Old Plan, New Plan, and HRA Flex Plan each contained reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses expressly stating that Xerox reserved the right to amend, suspend, or terminate \"the Plan described herein\" at any time and for any reason.\n\nWith respect to the HRA Flex Plan, Schedule H provided a \"Benefits Allowance\" for certain retirees who retired prior to age 65 (\"Pre\u201165 retirees\"). This allowance consisted of a \"Basic Allowance\" plus a \"Service Component\" and a \"LifeCycle Assistance Program Component.\" The Service Component equaled $20 multiplied by the retiree's total years of service with Xerox, up to a maximum of 30 years. The LifeCycle Assistance Program Component was based on the balance in the employee\u2019s LifeCycle Assistance Program account (a benefit available during employment) that the employee had not used during employment; that balance was to be spread over the retiree\u2019s expected lifetime using accepted actuarial assumptions and added to the Benefits Allowance each year.\n\nThe 2018\u201321 CBA expired on November 30, 2021, without a successor agreement. In December 2021, shortly after the CBA expired, Xerox announced that it would modify health benefits for individuals who had retired prior to the CBA\u2019s expiration. Xerox implemented the modifications in January 2022. According to the Union, the effect of Xerox\u2019s changes was to terminate or significantly reduce retiree health and life insurance benefits for more than 2,000 retirees and their family members.\n\nIn response, the Union filed a written \"Grievance Report\" under the CBA\u2019s grievance procedure. The grievance asserted that Xerox\u2019s plan to modify or terminate retiree benefits would modify and\/or terminate benefits that had accrued or vested under the agreement, thereby causing numerous violations of the CBA, including violations of Article VIII (the benefits article that incorporated Schedule H on retirement) and any other applicable provisions. The Union further demanded arbitration under the CBA\u2019s grievance procedure, taking the position that retiree benefits had vested under the CBA and incorporated plan language and thus could not be unilaterally terminated.\n\nXerox denied the grievance. In its written response, Xerox asserted that the grievance lacked merit because neither the main body of the CBA nor the incorporated plan documents contained clear and unambiguous language sufficient to vest retiree benefits for life under established legal precedent. Xerox subsequently declined the Union\u2019s demand for arbitration, stating that the CBA had expired and that there was therefore no arbitration provision currently in effect. The Union then issued a \"Notice of Intent to Arbitrate,\" reiterating its demand that Xerox submit the grievance to arbitration, while Xerox proceeded to implement its modifications to retiree benefits.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"After the Union issued its Notice of Intent to Arbitrate, Xerox filed a petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA). Xerox\u2019s petition sought to enjoin and permanently stay the arbitration demanded by the Union and sought declaratory relief. In its petition and accompanying motion, Xerox requested (1) an order enjoining and permanently staying the arbitration, and (2) a declaration regarding the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the expired 2018\u201321 CBA and the incorporated benefit plan documents with respect to retiree benefits and arbitration. The Union filed an answer, moved to dismiss Xerox\u2019s petition, and cross\u2011moved to compel arbitration and for injunctive relief to preserve the status quo pending arbitration.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court (Geraci, J.) concluded that the Union\u2019s grievance was not arbitrable under the expired 2018\u201321 CBA. The court determined that the CBA and incorporated plan documents did not contain written language that could be reasonably interpreted as promising that retiree health benefits would vest for life or otherwise extend beyond the term of the CBA. The court found that the references in the Old Plan and New Plan to coverage continuing until a retiree\u2019s death, or continuing for an eligible surviving spouse or domestic partner until his or her death, did not constitute vesting language. The court also addressed the HRA Plan\u2019s \"Benefits Allowance\" for pre\u201165 retirees and held that use of actuarial life expectancy in calculating that allowance did not show an intent to vest any benefit, characterizing the life expectancy reference as only one of several factors used in a formula.\n\nThe district court further concluded that, even if the CBA and incorporated documents could otherwise be read to suggest vesting, the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses in the 2016 plan restatements\u2014as incorporated into the CBA\u2014made clear that Xerox retained the right to amend, suspend, or terminate the plans at any time and for any reason, which the court viewed as inconsistent with any vested right to lifetime benefits. On this basis, the court held that retiree health benefits did not vest under the CBA, that Xerox\u2019s post\u2011expiration modification of retiree benefits did not infringe any accrued or vested contractual right, and that the dispute therefore did not \"arise under\" the expired CBA for purposes of post\u2011expiration arbitrability. The court granted Xerox\u2019s petition and motion to stay arbitration and to obtain declaratory relief, denied the Union\u2019s motion to dismiss and cross\u2011motion to compel arbitration and for injunctive relief, and entered judgment for Xerox.\n\nThe Union then filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment. The Union argued that this Court\u2019s intervening decision in Local Union 97, IBEW v. NRG Energy, Inc., 53 F.4th 42 (2d Cir. 2022), represented a change or clarification in controlling law regarding vesting and arbitrability of retiree benefits disputes under expired CBAs, and that the district court should apply that standard to find the dispute arbitrable. The district court denied the Rule 59(e) motion. It held that NRG Energy at most clarified the applicable legal standard and that, under that standard, the Union had not met its burden of identifying written language capable of reasonably being interpreted as a promise to vest retiree benefits. The court therefore left its prior judgment in place.",
        "what_is_appealed":"On appeal to the Second Circuit, the Union challenges the district court\u2019s determination that its grievance is not arbitrable under the expired 2018\u201321 CBA. Specifically, the Union appeals the district court\u2019s rulings that (1) the CBA and incorporated benefit plan documents do not contain written language reasonably capable of being interpreted as promising vested retiree benefits that survive expiration of the CBA or as providing deferred compensation that vested during the CBA\u2019s term, and (2) the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses in the plan documents preclude any interpretation that retiree benefits vested. The Union also contests the district court\u2019s entry of declaratory judgment in favor of Xerox and, in its Rule 59(e) motion context, argued that the district court misapplied this Court\u2019s standards regarding vesting language and arbitrability, including those articulated in NRG Energy."

          "legal_standard":"Under Supreme Court precedent, an expired CBA generally is no longer enforceable, but structural provisions such as arbitration clauses may survive expiration to enforce duties that arose under the agreement. A post\u2011expiration grievance arises under a CBA if it involves facts or occurrences that arose before expiration, an action taken after expiration that infringes a right that accrued or vested under the agreement, or a contractual right that survives expiration under normal contract principles. See Litton Financial Printing Div. v. NLRB. In the Second Circuit, to reach a trier of fact on a vesting claim, a union or employee need not point to unambiguous vesting language; it suffices to identify written language capable of reasonably being interpreted as a promise by the employer to vest benefits. See American Federation of Grain Millers v. International Multifoods Corp.; Schonholz v. Long Island Jewish Medical Center; Devlin v. Empire Blue Cross & Blue Shield. If the agreement\u2019s language is reasonably susceptible to such an interpretation, the ultimate vesting determination is for a trier of fact, often with the aid of extrinsic evidence. If the language is not reasonably susceptible to a vesting interpretation, no vested right exists and the dispute does not arise under the agreement.\n\nThe Supreme Court in M & G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett and CNH Industrial N.V. v. Reese instructs that CBAs are interpreted under ordinary principles of contract law, without any presumption that retiree benefits vest for life. Courts may not infer lifetime vesting from silence, and a contract is ambiguous only if, after applying established interpretive rules, it remains reasonably susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings. Under Second Circuit authority, a reviewing court first asks whether the CBA contains language vesting retiree benefits and, if so, whether other contractual provisions\u2014such as a reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clause\u2014defeat vesting.

          "The Union argues that the 2018\u201321 CBA and the incorporated 2016 restated plan documents contain affirmative durational language that can reasonably be read as promising benefits beyond the CBA\u2019s expiration and thus vesting them. Specifically, the Union points to: (a) language in the Old Plan and New Plan stating that each retiree continues participation in the plan until the earlier of the retiree ceasing to pay contributions or ceasing to be a retiree, and (b) survivor\u2011benefit language providing that if a retiree dies while a participant, the eligible surviving spouse or domestic partner continues as a participant in the plan until his or her death. The Union maintains that these provisions, by tying continuation of benefits to events that can occur long after the CBA\u2019s expiration (such as death), are reasonably interpreted as promises of lifetime\u2014or at least post\u2011expiration\u2014benefits.",
          "The Union further argues that the HRA Flex Plan\u2019s \"Benefits Allowance\" for pre\u201165 retirees is reasonably understood as a form of deferred compensation that vested during the life of the CBA. It emphasizes that the allowance includes a Service Component that increases with each year of service (up to 30 years) and a LifeCycle Assistance Program Component based on amounts the employee earned and chose not to spend during employment. In the Union\u2019s view, these features mirror severance or similar benefits that the Supreme Court and other courts have treated as accrued or vested rights, earned during the employment relationship and payable upon a specified event such as retirement.",
          "As to the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses, the Union contends that they do not unambiguously preclude vesting of retiree benefits promised in or through the CBA. The Union argues that the CBA is an independent source of retiree benefits and employer contribution obligations and that, while the CBA incorporates \"detailed terms and conditions\" of the plans, it does not necessarily incorporate or give overriding effect to the plans\u2019 reservation\u2011of\u2011rights language. The Union maintains that, at a minimum, the interaction between the CBA\u2019s benefit promises and the plans\u2019 reservation\u2011of\u2011rights provisions is ambiguous and must be resolved by a trier of fact after consideration of extrinsic evidence. It suggests that the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights language can be reasonably read as applying only to non\u2011vested benefits, to future participants who have not yet retired, or to plan details (such as specific procedures or benefit designs) rather than to the existence of core retiree benefits already bargained for.",
          "The Union asserts that under controlling precedent, once it has identified such potentially vesting language, the dispute over whether retiree benefits actually vested and the effect of the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses must be resolved by an arbitrator as the trier of fact, because the CBA\u2019s arbitration clause survives expiration to protect vested or accrued rights. The Union therefore argues that the district court should have compelled arbitration rather than deciding the vesting question on the merits at the threshold.",

It asserts that the Union has failed to make such a showing.",

Xerox maintains that the language on which the Union relies\u2014such as provisions that retirees continue participation until they stop paying contributions or cease to be retirees, and that surviving spouses or domestic partners continue as participants until death\u2014cannot reasonably be read as vesting language. Xerox emphasizes that similar references to \"death\" or continuation language have been held insufficient to imply vesting in other cases, and argues that those provisions simply describe eligibility and participation while the plans remain in effect, not a promise that benefits survive the CBA\u2019s expiration.",
          "With respect to the HRA Flex Plan\u2019s \"Benefits Allowance\" for pre\u201165 retirees, Xerox argues that the use of actuarial life expectancy and years of service in the calculation formula does not transform the allowance into vested deferred compensation. It characterizes the life expectancy reference as merely one of several formula components and contends that the allowance is a benefit available only so long as the plan and CBA remain in force, not an accrued right payable regardless of future events.",
          "Xerox relies heavily on the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses in the 2016 plan restatements, which state that Xerox reserves the right to amend, suspend, or terminate each plan at any time and for any reason. Xerox argues that these clauses are broad and unambiguous and are incorporated into the CBA by Schedule H\u2019s reference to the plans\u2019 \"detailed terms and conditions.\" Xerox maintains that a benefit that the employer may unilaterally amend or terminate at any time cannot be considered vested by definition, and that the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights language therefore forecloses any reasonable interpretation that the CBA or plans promise vested retiree benefits enforceable after expiration.",
          "Xerox further contends that there is no valid agreement to arbitrate grievances brought by the Union on behalf of retirees because the CBA\u2019s grievance and arbitration procedures apply only to \"employees,\" not retirees, and that the Union therefore cannot compel arbitration of retiree\u2011based claims even apart from the vesting issue. (The district court did not reach this argument, but Xerox raises it as an alternative ground related to arbitrability.)",
          "In response to the Union\u2019s reliance on NRG Energy, Xerox maintains that NRG Energy dealt in part with the scope of an arbitration clause and that, in any event, the decision does not alter the requirement that the Union identify contract language reasonably susceptible to a vesting interpretation. Xerox argues that, under that standard and in light of the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses, the district court correctly determined that the Union failed to meet its burden and that the grievance does not arise under the expired CBA."

          "reasoning":"Whether the post\u2011expiration dispute is arbitrable turns on contract interpretation under Litton and Tackett\/CNH, reviewed de novo. The Union must point to language in the CBA\/plan documents reasonably susceptible to a promise of vested or otherwise surviving benefits. The key provisions say retirees remain in the Old\/New Plans until they cease paying contributions or cease to be retirees, and that surviving spouses\/domestic partners may remain participants until their deaths. Under Tackett and CNH, courts may not infer lifetime vesting from silence or from ordinary durational references; references to death or continuation while the plan exists are typically treated as descriptions of eligibility, not as promises that the plan (or benefit level) itself will last for life. The Second Circuit\u2019s own vesting cases (e.g., Kelly v. Honeywell) read similar language narrowly and insist on at least some reasonably clear indication that the employer\u2019s obligation extends beyond the agreement\u2019s duration. Here, there is an express, ordinary durational clause limiting the CBA itself, and nothing in Schedule H purports to override that end date. The HRA \"Benefits Allowance\" uses years of service and actuarial life expectancy in a formula, but the benefit is still defined as part of the HRA Plan, which is itself made subject to amendment\/termination. Second Circuit precedent has refused to treat service\u2011based formulas, without more, as sufficient vesting language when accompanied by broad reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses. Given that the Union\u2019s theory of arbitrability rests entirely on vesting or deferred\u2011compensation rights, and those rights are not reasonably found in the written language once ordinary contract principles and the clear plan\u2011level reservations are considered, the district court could properly conclude that no right accrued or vested under the CBA that would be infringed by Xerox\u2019s post\u2011expiration conduct. Accordingly, the grievance does not \"arise under\" the expired CBA and is not subject to its arbitration clause."

          "reasoning":"The interaction between the alleged vesting language and the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses is also a matter of contract interpretation, reviewed de novo. Each 2016 restated plan reserves to Xerox the right to amend, suspend, or terminate \"the Plan described herein at any time and for any reason.\" Those documents are expressly incorporated via Schedule H as providing the governing \"detailed terms and conditions\" of the retiree medical programs. Under Second Circuit authority such as Multifoods and Abbruscato, when the same operative documents that purportedly promise ongoing benefits also contain clear, broad reservation\u2011of\u2011rights language, the combined text cannot reasonably be read as a promise of vested benefits, absent some more specific, overriding guarantee. Here, no such overriding language appears either in the CBA\u2019s main body or in Schedule H. Treating the CBA as an independent vesting source does not avoid the problem, because the CBA explicitly subordinates the benefits to the terms of the plans themselves. Reading the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clause as limited only to non\u2011vested or future benefits would require importing a limitation the language does not contain and would contradict the unqualified \"at any time and for any reason\" phrasing. Nor does construing the clause according to its terms render Xerox\u2019s promises illusory: retirees had enforceable rights to receive the stated benefits so long as the plans remained in effect and were not amended or terminated pursuant to the reserved power. Given Abbruscato and Multifoods, a Second Circuit panel is likely to hold that these broad, unqualified reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses preclude any reasonable interpretation that the plans, as incorporated, grant vested benefits enforceable beyond plan\/CBA expiration."

          "reasoning":"The question whether the Union met its threshold burden under Devlin, Multifoods, and NRG Energy to identify language reasonably capable of a vesting interpretation is a legal issue reviewed de novo. NRG Energy did not change the threshold standard; it reaffirmed that a plaintiff\/union need only show language reasonably susceptible to a vesting reading to reach a factfinder. The district court explicitly applied that standard twice\u2014originally and again in denying the Rule 59(e) motion after considering NRG Energy\u2014and concluded that, in light of the clear plan\u2011level reservation\u2011of\u2011rights provisions and the absence of any specific lifetime or post\u2011expiration commitment in the CBA text, the language was not reasonably susceptible to the Union\u2019s vesting interpretation. That analysis is consistent with the Second Circuit\u2019s approach in Kelly and Abbruscato: where a document both describes ongoing benefits and clearly reserves an unrestricted right to terminate or amend, courts have resolved the vesting question as a matter of law, finding no colorable vesting language. The district court did not require unambiguous vesting language; it held instead that, after applying ordinary interpretive rules and considering the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses, no reasonable reading supports vesting. Under NRG Energy, that conclusion is within the proper judicial role at the arbitrability stage, and the court did not improperly decide merits that should have gone to an arbitrator.

The continuation\u2011until\u2011death and actuarial\u2011life\u2011expectancy features, when read alongside those reservations, look like ordinary eligibility and design provisions, not enforceable promises of lifetime benefits that survive expiration. Under Second Circuit precedent (Multifoods, Abbruscato, Kelly) and Supreme Court guidance (Tackett, CNH), courts will not infer vesting from such language where the employer has expressly retained the right to amend or terminate the plans at any time. Local 97 v. NRG Energy reinforces the low threshold to reach a factfinder but does not alter the requirement that the text be reasonably susceptible to a vesting reading. Here, given the strength and clarity of the reservation\u2011of\u2011rights clauses and the absence of specific contrary guarantees in the CBA itself, a panel is likely to agree with the district court that the Union has not met that threshold.

      "factual_background":"The dispute arises from a landlord\u2011tenant conflict on the Vermont farm of Dr. Lydia Clemmons. In 2017, Dr. Clemmons rented an outbuilding on her farm to a tenant and, during disputes with that tenant, made multiple calls to the Vermont State Police (VSP) asking officers to intervene. VSP troopers, including trooper Andrew Leise, responded to these calls and made several visits to her property.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Dr. Clemmons came to believe that VSP troopers were disregarding her complaints. She then filed a discrimination complaint with the Vermont Human Rights Commission (VHRC), a state commission charged with investigating discrimination claims. Her VHRC complaint asserted that VSP troopers discriminated against her on the basis of sex and race in connection with their handling of her landlord\u2011tenant dispute.\n\nThe VHRC opened an investigation into whether the VSP had engaged in discriminatory conduct in its dealings with Dr. Clemmons. At the conclusion of the investigation, VHRC staff prepared an \"Investigative Report\" that recommended a finding that VSP\u2019s actions were discriminatory. The Investigative Report expressly identified trooper Leise as one of the responding troopers, criticized his actions, and concluded that his conduct was discriminatory.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, the VHRC commissioners voted to find that there were reasonable grounds to believe that VSP had discriminated against Dr. Clemmons. On June 10, 2021, the VHRC provided the Investigative Report to Seven Days, a local newspaper published by Da Capo Publishing, Inc. On June 23, 2021, Seven Days published an article describing the alleged discrimination by VSP against Dr. Clemmons and making the Investigative Report publicly available.\n\nLeise alleges in his complaint that VHRC members Kevin Christie and Bor Yang were involved in providing Da Capo with the Investigative Report. He further alleges that the Investigative Report\u2019s conclusion that his conduct was discriminatory was false and based on intentionally false and misleading factual accounts. He contends that Vermont law requires VHRC complaint and investigative materials to remain confidential and that the Investigative Report was within the category of documents that must be kept confidential.\n\nLeise alleges that the release of the Investigative Report to the newspaper was unlawful under Vermont confidentiality provisions and that Christie, Yang, and the VHRC intentionally and maliciously disclosed it. According to the complaint, the publication of the Investigative Report severely damaged his professional reputation, led to his resignation from the Vermont State Police, and hindered his ability to obtain other law\u2011enforcement\u2011related employment. He further alleges that Yang and Christie authored or were responsible for the false and misleading Investigative Report and then released it to the press to obtain favorable media coverage for VHRC leadership and to influence public opinion against the VSP and its troopers.",

His first amended complaint asserted six causes of action: (1) a liberty\u2011interest procedural due process claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; (2) a property\u2011interest procedural due process claim under \u00a7 1983; (3) a substantive due process claim under \u00a7 1983 alleging arbitrary, oppressive, and conscience\u2011shocking government action; (4) an invasion of privacy claim under Vermont law; (5) a defamation claim under Vermont law; and (6) a tortious interference with contract claim under Vermont law. All of these claims were asserted against the VHRC, Christie, and Yang in their official and individual capacities; the same substantive theories were also asserted against Da Capo.",

For the official\u2011capacity claims, including those against the VHRC itself, they invoked state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. For the individual\u2011capacity claims against Christie and Yang, they asserted absolute immunity and qualified immunity under both federal and Vermont law.\n\nIn an order dated March 24, 2023, the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The court:\n- Determined that the VHRC and its agents were an \"arm of the state\" of Vermont and entitled to sovereign immunity, and on that basis dismissed all claims against the VHRC and against Christie and Yang in their official capacities.\n- Dismissed the \u00a7 1983 and state\u2011law claims against Christie and Yang in their individual capacities on absolute\u2011immunity grounds insofar as those claims arose from the VHRC\u2019s investigative activities, its decision\u2011making process, and its final determination of reasonable grounds.\n- Dismissed the tortious interference with contract claim for failure to state a claim.\n- Denied the motion to dismiss as to: (a) the \u00a7 1983 claims against Christie and Yang in their individual capacities to the extent those claims were based on the alleged release of the Investigative Report to Da Capo; and (b) the Vermont\u2011law defamation and invasion\u2011of\u2011privacy claims against Christie and Yang in their individual capacities.\n\nAs to the remaining \u00a7 1983 claims tied to the release of the Investigative Report, the court concluded at that stage that Christie and Yang were not entitled to federal qualified immunity because the record lacked sufficient information to determine, as a matter of law, whether the release of the Investigative Report violated the relevant Vermont confidentiality statute (Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7 4555(a)(1)). With respect to the surviving state\u2011law defamation and invasion\u2011of\u2011privacy claims, the court held that Leise had adequately pleaded them and that ambiguities in the factual record precluded a determination at that time whether Christie and Yang were entitled to qualified immunity under Vermont law.\n\nOn April 5, 2023, the VHRC, Christie, and Yang moved for reconsideration, contending, among other things, that the court had not sufficiently addressed the merits of their challenge to Leise\u2019s remaining \u00a7 1983 claims. In a June 29, 2023 order on reconsideration, the district court held that Leise had plausibly alleged a substantive due process claim based on the release of the Investigative Report but dismissed his remaining procedural due process claims. The court otherwise left its earlier rulings unchanged, including the sovereign\u2011immunity ruling in favor of the VHRC and official\u2011capacity defendants and the refusal to grant qualified immunity to Christie and Yang at the pleading stage as to the substantive due process, defamation, and invasion\u2011of\u2011privacy claims based on the report\u2019s release.\n\nAfter dismissing the claims against the VHRC, the district court entered partial final judgment in favor of the VHRC under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).

          "Christie and Yang argue that the district court improperly denied them federal qualified immunity on the substantive due process claim. They contend that Leise\u2019s theory of a constitutional violation is premised on alleged violations of Vermont confidentiality law governing VHRC files, but Vermont law does not clearly designate an \"investigative report\" as a confidential document. They emphasize that the relevant statute, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7 4555, makes VHRC complaint and investigative files confidential with certain exceptions and permits public release of determinations and party names when reasonable grounds are found, but it does not expressly address investigative reports as such. They further point to VHRC rules that define \"investigative report\" as a document distinct from the complaint and investigative file, and they assert that, in light of this framework, it was at least reasonable for them to believe that releasing the Investigative Report was lawful. Given this statutory and regulatory ambiguity, they maintain that no clearly established federal right to the confidentiality of the Investigative Report existed and that they therefore are entitled to qualified immunity.",
          "Regarding state qualified immunity, Christie and Yang contend that they meet Vermont\u2019s standard because they were acting within the scope of their official duties at the VHRC, performing discretionary functions related to the handling and dissemination of investigative materials, and acted in good faith reliance on their understanding of Vermont law and VHRC rules. They argue that, for substantially the same reasons that they are entitled to federal qualified immunity, they should also be shielded from liability under Vermont\u2019s qualified\u2011immunity doctrine for the defamation and invasion\u2011of\u2011privacy claims.",
          "On the sovereign\u2011immunity issue raised by Leise\u2019s cross\u2011appeal, Christie, Yang, and the VHRC support the district court\u2019s conclusion that the VHRC is an arm of the State. They emphasize that a large majority of the VHRC\u2019s budget comes from the Vermont Legislature\u2019s appropriations from the State\u2019s General Fund; that VHRC staff are treated as state employees whose salaries, benefits, defense, and indemnification are governed and funded by the State; and that Vermont law requires state agencies, commissions, and similar entities to participate in a state liability self\u2011insurance fund for the payment of judgments. They note that VHRC commissioners are appointed by the Governor, with Senate consent, and serve at the Governor\u2019s pleasure, and that the VHRC must report annually to the Legislature and submit a proposed budget, demonstrating significant state control. They further argue that VHRC is characterized in state law as a state commission with statewide jurisdiction and functions, not as a local governmental entity, and that its mission to protect civil and human rights across Vermont is a statewide governmental function. On this basis, they maintain that the VHRC is an arm of the State entitled to sovereign immunity from suit in federal court."

          "On the substantive due process claim, Leise argues that Christie and Yang\u2019s conduct in allegedly manipulating, falsifying, and then releasing the Investigative Report was arbitrary, oppressive, and conscience\u2011shocking, and that it violated his substantive due process rights. He contends that Vermont law clearly required that VHRC investigative materials, including the Investigative Report, remain confidential, and that the release of the report was therefore unlawful and in violation of his constitutional rights. He maintains that Christie and Yang should have known that releasing the Investigative Report violated Vermont law and, by extension, his clearly established substantive due process rights. He asserts that at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, his allegations must be taken as true, including the allegations that the report was intentionally falsified and released for improper purposes, and that these allegations defeat any claim to qualified immunity at this early stage.",
          "With respect to state qualified immunity on his defamation and invasion\u2011of\u2011privacy claims, Leise argues that Christie and Yang are not entitled to immunity under Vermont\u2019s test because their alleged conduct\u2014intentionally authoring a false and misleading Investigative Report and unlawfully releasing it to the press to advance their own reputational interests and harm his\u2014was outside the scope of good\u2011faith, discretionary execution of their duties. He contends that their actions were malicious, not in good faith, and exceeded any lawful authority they may have had under Vermont statutes and VHRC rules, thereby defeating state qualified immunity.",
          "On his cross\u2011appeal regarding sovereign immunity, Leise argues that the district court incorrectly characterized the VHRC as an arm of the State. He asserts that the VHRC is described in Vermont law as an independent entity and that this characterization weighs against treating it as a state agency for Eleventh Amendment purposes. He further argues that the VHRC\u2019s structure and operations reflect a level of independence from direct state control that should preclude sovereign immunity, and that its status, funding, and control mechanisms differ from those of traditional core state departments. On this basis, he contends that his claims against the VHRC, and the related official\u2011capacity claims against Christie and Yang, should not have been dismissed on sovereign\u2011immunity grounds."

          "reasoning":"Whether Christie and Yang are entitled to federal qualified immunity on the \u00a7 1983 substantive due process claim is a legal question reviewed de novo on an interlocutory appeal, assuming the court accepts the district court\u2019s view of the facts as alleged. Even taking as true that the report was slanted, maliciously motivated, and released to the press, the qualified-immunity inquiry turns on whether there was a clearly established substantive due process right, in 2021, that would have put a reasonable VHRC official on notice that authoring and releasing an investigative report of this type violated the Constitution.\n\nSubstantive due process is narrowly confined to truly egregious conduct and, in the government-employee context, courts are very reluctant to constitutionalize reputation-related injuries arising from government speech or disclosures (the general rule being that defamation or reputational harm alone does not state a due process claim). Here, Leise\u2019s theory is effectively that violating an ambiguous state confidentiality regime, in a way that harmed his reputation and career, amounts to conscience\u2011shocking constitutional misconduct.\n\nThe statutory and regulatory backdrop is, by the appellants\u2019 account, at best unclear: the Vermont statute makes complaint and investigative files confidential but explicitly allows some public disclosure when reasonable grounds are found, and VHRC\u2019s own rules define an \u201cinvestigative report\u201d as distinct from the confidential file. In such an uncertain legal environment, there is no robust, clearly established federal authority indicating that releasing a report of this sort\u2014even if state law secrecy rules were in fact violated\u2014constitutes a substantive due process violation, much less one whose contours would be clear to reasonable VHRC officials. At the motion\u2011to\u2011dismiss stage, this deficiency on the \u201cclearly established\u201d prong is dispositive. The appellate court is therefore likely to hold that Christie and Yang are entitled to federal qualified immunity and order dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 substantive due process claim against them in their individual capacities."

          "standard_of_review":"de novo",
          "prediction":"REVERSE",
          "reasoning":"State-law qualified immunity under Vermont law is likewise a legal question on a motion to dismiss, reviewed de novo, taking well\u2011pleaded factual allegations as true but assessing whether they defeat immunity as a matter of law. Vermont\u2019s test requires that the officials (1) acted within the scope of employment and authority; (2) acted in good faith; and (3) performed discretionary, not ministerial, acts.\n\nThere is no serious dispute that drafting and disseminating VHRC investigative materials is a discretionary function undertaken in the course of VHRC business and within the general scope of Christie and Yang\u2019s official roles. The contest is over \u201cgood faith.\u201d But Vermont\u2019s good\u2011faith inquiry is typically objective and closely related to whether the official reasonably believed his or her conduct was lawful, not whether the plaintiff characterizes the conduct as malicious. Leise\u2019s allegations of bad motive and career harm do not themselves strip officials of immunity if the legal framework they were operating under was debatable.\n\nHere, the same statutory and regulatory ambiguities that support federal qualified immunity also strongly support a finding of good faith as a matter of Vermont law: the confidentiality statute does not expressly identify investigative reports as confidential, and VHRC\u2019s rules conceptually separate such reports from the protected \u201cfile.\u201d On such a record, it is difficult to say that Christie and Yang clearly lacked a reasonable, good\u2011faith basis to think that releasing the report (especially following a reasonable\u2011grounds finding) was within their lawful authority. Vermont courts typically do not deny qualified immunity solely on bare assertions of malice where the legal landscape is uncertain and the acts are facially official and discretionary. The appellate court is thus likely to conclude that Christie and Yang are entitled to Vermont qualified immunity on the defamation and invasion\u2011of\u2011privacy claims and reverse the district court\u2019s denial of dismissal of those claims."

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"Whether VHRC is an arm of the State for Eleventh Amendment purposes is a legal question reviewed de novo under the four\u2011factor Second Circuit test. Applying those factors, VHRC looks like a classic state agency: (1) Funding and risk of judgment: VHRC is funded predominantly by legislative appropriations from Vermont\u2019s General Fund, its staff are state employees, and Vermont provides defense and indemnification through a statewide liability\/self\u2011insurance mechanism. A money judgment would, in practical effect, be paid from state funds. This factor strongly favors arm\u2011of\u2011the\u2011state status. (2) State control: Commissioners are appointed by the Governor with Senate confirmation and serve at the Governor\u2019s pleasure; VHRC must report annually to the Legislature and submit budget proposals. That degree of appointment, removal, and budgetary oversight demonstrates substantial state control. (3) State\u2011law characterization: The enabling statutes describe VHRC as a state commission, not a municipal or regional body, and lodge it within the state\u2019s executive framework. The label \u201cindependent\u201d in some contexts typically reflects independence from regulated entities or from political interference in particular decisions, not independence from State status for Eleventh Amendment purposes. (4) Function: VHRC\u2019s mission\u2014investigating and enforcing anti\u2011discrimination norms throughout Vermont\u2014is quintessentially statewide.\n\nWeighing these factors, VHRC plainly qualifies as an arm of the State. The district court\u2019s dismissal of claims against VHRC and against Christie and Yang in their official capacities on sovereign\u2011immunity grounds therefore accords with controlling doctrine, and the cross\u2011appeal challenging that determination is likely to be rejected."

      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",
      "confidence":0.81,
      "reasoning":"The appeal presents one cluster of issues about individual\u2011capacity immunity and a distinct cross\u2011appeal on sovereign immunity for the VHRC as an entity. On the federal and state qualified\u2011immunity questions, the pertinent legal standards are forgiving to officials and focus on objective legal clarity and good\u2011faith, discretionary performance of official functions. Given the admitted ambiguity in the Vermont confidentiality statute and VHRC\u2019s own rules as to whether an \u201cinvestigative report\u201d was confidential, it is unlikely that the appellate court will find a clearly established substantive due process right or a clearly demonstrable lack of good faith. That points strongly toward reversing the denials of qualified immunity and ordering dismissal of the remaining individual\u2011capacity claims.\n\nBy contrast, the sovereign\u2011immunity analysis for VHRC aligns with a familiar pattern in arm\u2011of\u2011the\u2011state jurisprudence: state\u2011funded, statewide commissions with gubernatorially appointed leadership and statutory indemnification are routinely held immune. Leise\u2019s emphasis on VHRC\u2019s \u201cindependence\u201d is not enough to overcome the strong indicators of state control and financial responsibility. The district court\u2019s sovereign\u2011immunity ruling is therefore likely to be affirmed. Combining these outcomes, the appellate disposition is mixed: reversal as to the denials of qualified immunity for Christie and Yang in their individual capacities, and affirmance of the dismissal of claims against the VHRC and official\u2011capacity defendants."

      "factual_background":"In April 2006, the T\/V Margara, a 748\u2011foot double\u2011hulled oil tanker carrying more than 300,000 barrels of No. 6 fuel oil, ran aground on a coral reef about three miles off the coast of Tallaboa, near Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. At all relevant times, Ernst Jacob GmbH & Co. KG owned or operated the vessel, and Shipowners Insurance & Guaranty Company, Ltd. (SIGCo) was a financial guarantor\/insurer for the vessel.\n\nAfter the vessel grounded, the crew notified the U.S. Coast Guard and unsuccessfully attempted to free the vessel. The pre\u2011designated Federal On\u2011Scene Coordinator (FOSC) for the area, Captain James Tunstall of the U.S. Coast Guard, assumed control of response operations under the National Contingency Plan. The Coast Guard deployed containment booms to guard against a potential oil spill and supervised efforts to refloat and move the vessel to deeper waters. No oil was ultimately discharged, and an underwater hull survey later showed only cosmetic damage to the vessel\u2019s hull. However, the physical operations needed to free the vessel and reduce the risk of an oil release damaged the reef: approximately 7,000 square meters of coral reef were destroyed or destabilized.\n\nThe parties dispute whether Captain Tunstall, acting as FOSC, actually made a formal determination that the grounding posed a \u201csubstantial threat of a discharge of oil\u201d within the meaning of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702(a). The United States maintains that he did make such a determination, relying in part on a later declaration from Tunstall describing his real\u2011time risk assessment and his conclusion that there was a substantial threat of discharge. The defendants contest that any such determination was made and also dispute its legal significance.\n\nAfter the incident, NOAA (acting as a federal natural resource trustee) and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER), the Commonwealth\u2019s natural resource trustee, jointly undertook emergency restoration measures and a multi\u2011year natural resource damage assessment relating to injuries to coral resources, other reef biota, and reef habitat over a large area. NOAA and PRDNER sometimes coordinated their efforts with Ernst Jacob during this process.\n\nIn April 2015, NOAA and PRDNER issued a document titled \u201cFinal Primary Restoration Plan and Environmental Assessment for the 2006 T\/V Margara Grounding, Guayanilla, Puerto Rico.\u201d This plan contained an assessment of the natural resource injuries from the grounding and described proposed primary restoration actions for the injured coral and reef habitat. The trustees described this 2015 plan as only the first phase of a full accounting of natural resource damages from the incident and stated that a future plan would address additional restoration actions.\n\nIn July 2016, NOAA and PRDNER presented a claim for primary restoration costs to Independent Maritime Consulting, a representative for Ernst Jacob, and to Norwegian Hull Club, one of Ernst Jacob\u2019s insurers. They received no response. In April 2017, they sent the primary restoration cost claim to Pierson and Burnett, LLP, identified on the T\/V Margara\u2019s Certificate of Financial Responsibility as an authorized agent, but the package was returned undeliverable. Also in April 2017, NOAA and PRDNER presented the primary restoration claim to SIGCo, listed as the guarantor on the Certificate of Financial Responsibility. SIGCo declined to pay in July 2017.\n\nNOAA then submitted a claim to the Coast Guard\u2019s National Pollution Funds Center (NPFC) seeking payment from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for the primary restoration costs under OPA\u2019s compensation scheme. NPFC determined that the proposed Primary Restoration Project was reasonable and appropriate under OPA and the National Contingency Plan. Around May 30, 2019, NPFC issued a Final Reconsidered Claim Determination awarding $4,403,590.98 for primary restoration, plus authorization for $794,183.46 in contingency funds. NPFC disbursed the primary restoration award in August 2019 and paid the contingency funds in May 2021. NPFC also incurred $54,776.50 in administrative costs processing the claim.\n\nSeparately, NOAA incurred natural resource damage assessment costs totaling $1,847,195.09 for its work evaluating injury and restoration needs. In October 2009, Independent Maritime Consulting, on behalf of Ernst Jacob, paid NOAA $433,352.49 toward these assessment costs, leaving alleged unrecovered assessment costs of $1,413,842.60. On December 9, 2021, NOAA and PRDNER issued their final natural resource damage assessment, proposing compensatory restoration measures intended to replace lost coral resources and to restore degraded and impacted coral reefs. They estimated that the compensatory restoration plan would cost $29,397,476. On the same date, NOAA and PRDNER presented a claim to Ernst Jacob and SIGCo for compensatory restoration costs and for outstanding assessment costs.\n\nThe United States\u2019 legal theory is that the coral reef and associated natural resources injured by the grounding are \u201cnatural resources\u201d within the meaning of OPA and that these resources are under the trusteeship, management, or control of NOAA and\/or the United States by virtue of federal law and federal\u2011Puerto Rico co\u2011trustee arrangements. The defendants dispute that the natural resources at issue qualify as resources \u201cbelonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to the United States\u201d and contend they fall exclusively within Puerto Rico\u2019s sovereign domain under the Federal Relations Act and related statutes and agreements.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On December 9, 2021, the United States filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico against Ernst Jacob and SIGCo. The United States brought the action on behalf of the NPFC and NOAA under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701\u20132761.\n\nThe original complaint asserted, in substance, a subrogated natural resource damages claim: NPFC had paid NOAA from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for primary restoration, and under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2715(a) NPFC became subrogated to NOAA\u2019s rights against any responsible party liable for those costs under OPA \u00a7 2702(a).\n\nOn March 25, 2022, the United States filed an amended complaint (the operative \"Complaint\"). That pleading asserted two primary OPA claims against Ernst Jacob and SIGCo, relying on the statutory liability provision, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702(a):\n1. A claim on behalf of NPFC for reimbursement of all compensation the Fund paid to the trustees for natural resource damages relating to the T\/V Margara incident, together with NPFC\u2019s associated processing costs, on a subrogation theory under \u00a7 2715.\n2. A direct claim on behalf of NOAA for uncompensated natural resource damages and for NOAA\u2019s unreimbursed assessment costs. These uncompensated damages were tied to NOAA and PRDNER\u2019s Final Compensatory Restoration Plan and the outstanding assessment costs.\n\nIn both claims, the United States alleged that Ernst Jacob (as owner\/operator) and SIGCo (as guarantor) were \u201cresponsible parties\u201d for the T\/V Margara under OPA and therefore liable, under \u00a7 2702(a) and \u00a7 2702(b)(2)(A), for damages to natural resources resulting from an \u201cincident\u201d \u2014 here, an occurrence involving a vessel that resulted in either a discharge or a substantial threat of a discharge of oil into U.S. navigable waters.\n\nThe United States sought (A) a declaratory judgment that defendants are liable for all uncompensated natural resource damages arising from the grounding; (B) a money judgment in favor of NPFC for all Fund payments and associated NPFC costs; (C) a money judgment in favor of NOAA for all natural resource damages identified in the Final Compensatory Restoration Plan and for NOAA\u2019s outstanding assessment costs; and (D) further appropriate relief.\n\nDuring the litigation, PRDNER intervened with separate claims under OPA and Puerto Rico law for injuries to Puerto Rico\u2019s natural resources. Those intervenor claims are not at issue on this appeal.\n\nErnst Jacob and SIGCo, in turn, filed third\u2011party complaints (explicitly designated as admiralty claims under Rule 9(h)) against Margara Shipping Ltd. (another owner of the vessel) and Steamship Mutual Underwriting Association, Ltd. (another insurer). In these third\u2011party complaints, Ernst Jacob and SIGCo sought subrogation or contribution for any liabilities they might incur to the United States or to PRDNER as a result of the T\/V Margara grounding.\n\nThe parties later jointly proposed bifurcating the case into a liability phase and, if needed, a damages phase. In a joint proposed scheduling plan, they agreed bifurcation was appropriate but disagreed over whether further fact discovery was needed before resolving liability. The United States took the position that discovery on liability was unnecessary because, in its view, the liability question turned solely on the FOSC\u2019s statutory determination about a substantial threat of discharge. Defendants argued the opposite, emphasizing that no discovery had yet occurred and that they needed discovery to develop a factual record on liability issues, including whether any substantial threat of discharge existed and the nature of the resources allegedly injured.\n\nWithin a week of the September 2022 status conference, the United States filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability under OPA \u00a7 2702(a), before merits discovery. It contended that the undisputed facts showed that the Margara grounding was an \u201cincident\u201d involving a vessel posing a substantial threat of discharge and that Ernst Jacob and SIGCo were responsible parties, leaving only the damages phase for later.\n\nDefendants filed a joint opposition to the motion for partial summary judgment and also sought relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), arguing that summary judgment was premature without discovery and that they needed discovery to contest both the existence of a substantial threat of discharge and the federal government\u2019s asserted management or control over the damaged natural resources.",
        "district_court_decision":"On September 7, 2023, the district court granted the United States\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment on liability under OPA \u00a7 2702(a).\n\nThe district court identified the pivotal liability question as whether the T\/V Margara grounding constituted an \u201cincident\u201d under OPA \u2014 specifically, whether the vessel, when grounded, posed a \u201csubstantial threat of a discharge of oil\u201d so as to trigger \u00a7 2702(a) liability for natural resource damages. The court noted that the parties did not dispute certain foundational points: that Ernst Jacob was an operator and SIGCo a guarantor of the T\/V Margara; that the vessel was a \u201cvessel\u201d under OPA; that the grounding occurred in navigable waters of the United States; and that coral reefs were damaged as a result of response efforts.\n\nThe court concluded that Congress had delegated the authority to make \u201csubstantial threat\u201d determinations to the pre\u2011designated Coast Guard FOSC under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the National Contingency Plan. Relying on a declaration from Captain Tunstall and other record materials, the court found that the FOSC had, in fact, determined that the Margara grounding posed a substantial threat of a discharge of oil. Treating that determination as an informal agency action, the court reviewed it under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s arbitrary\u2011and\u2011capricious standard, confined to the administrative record as understood by the court.\n\nThe district court concluded that the FOSC\u2019s substantial\u2011threat determination was not arbitrary or capricious. Based on that conclusion, the court held that there was no genuine dispute of material fact that the grounding posed a substantial threat of an oil discharge, that the event therefore constituted an OPA \u201cincident,\u201d and that Ernst Jacob and SIGCo were liable to the United States, as a matter of law, for natural resource damages under \u00a7 2702(a). The order resolved only liability; the amount and scope of damages were left for later proceedings. The district court did not specifically analyze or expressly rule on the defendants\u2019 argument that the United States could only recover natural resource damages for resources \u201cbelonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to the United States,\u201d nor did it explicitly decide whether the coral reef resources at issue met that statutory criterion.\n\nThe district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling did not resolve PRDNER\u2019s intervenor claims or the third\u2011party admiralty claims against Margara Shipping and Steamship Mutual. Those claims remained pending.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Ernst Jacob and SIGCo filed a timely interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting partial summary judgment on liability under OPA \u00a7 2702(a). They invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3), which authorizes interlocutory appeals in admiralty cases from decrees determining the rights and liabilities of the parties, arguing that the presence of properly designated admiralty third\u2011party claims renders the overall case an admiralty case for purposes of that provision.\n\nOn appeal, the defendants challenge:\n1. The district court\u2019s determination that, for purposes of OPA \u00a7 2702(a) liability, the existence of a \u201csubstantial threat of a discharge of oil\u201d could be treated as an agency determination reviewed deferentially under the APA, rather than as an element of liability to be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\n2. The district court\u2019s assumption or implicit conclusion that the United States could recover natural resource damages under \u00a7 2702(a) for injuries to the damaged coral reef and associated resources, even though, according to defendants, those resources do not \u201cbelong to, [are not] managed by, [are not] controlled by, or [do not] appertain[ ] to\u201d the United States within the meaning of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2706(a)(1).\n3. The grant of summary judgment on liability before discovery, including the denial or effective denial of their request for Rule 56(d) discovery on issues such as the actual degree of threat of an oil discharge and the nature of any federal management or control of the injured resources.\n\nThe interlocutory appeal does not directly challenge or resolve the pending damages phase, PRDNER\u2019s separate claims, or the remaining third\u2011party admiralty claims."

They contend that nothing in \u00a7 2702(a) or related statutory provisions delegates to the Coast Guard or the FOSC the authority to conclusively determine the existence of a substantial threat for purposes of civil liability. In their view, the district court erred by treating the FOSC\u2019s purported substantial\u2011threat determination as an informal agency action and by reviewing it only for arbitrariness and capriciousness instead of requiring the United States to prove the substantial\u2011threat element by a preponderance of the evidence, subject to ordinary civil fact\u2011finding and summary judgment standards.",

They assert that Congress did not provide, either expressly or by necessary implication, that FOSC determinations made to guide response efforts would be binding on courts determining civil liability under OPA. They distinguish cases under CERCLA and OPA that apply arbitrary\u2011and\u2011capricious review to the reasonableness of government response costs, arguing that those precedents concern classification and consistency of actions as 'removal costs' or 'remedial actions,' not the threshold existence of an incident or threat necessary to impose liability.",
          "United States lacks statutory right to recover NRD for these resources: Appellants argue that the damaged coral reefs and associated marine life do not qualify as natural resources 'belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to the United States' under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2706(a)(1). They rely heavily on the Federal Relations Act, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 749, which vests 'control' \u2014 defined to include all right, title, and proprietary rights of ownership, and rights of management, administration, leasing, use, and development \u2014 over submerged lands and associated natural resources in and around Puerto Rico in the Commonwealth government, except where reserved by the United States. From this, they contend that Puerto Rico has exclusive ownership and management of the submerged lands and resources where the grounding occurred, so that any natural resource damages claim for those resources belongs to Puerto Rico, not the United States. They argue that the United States has not shown that these specific coral resources are 'federal' natural resources within the meaning of \u00a7 2706(a)(1).",
          "Mere regulatory jurisdiction is insufficient to establish 'management or control': Even if Puerto Rico\u2019s authority is not exclusive, appellants contend that the United States has not demonstrated, as a matter of fact or law, that it 'manages' or 'controls' these resources. They argue that NOAA\u2019s general regulatory authority under statutes like the Endangered Species Act, the Magnuson\u2011Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Coral Reef Conservation Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act does not automatically convert all privately or locally owned natural resources within those regulatory regimes into federal resources for OPA purposes. They assert that neither the district court nor the United States identified specific statutory provisions or concrete management actions by NOAA that would show the requisite degree of management or control over the particular reef and species at issue, as distinct from general regulatory oversight or shared management concepts. They also dispute that the grounding site was habitat for any Endangered Species Act\u2011listed species at the time of the incident, which they say undercuts the claim of federal resource management.",

However, they argue that such an MOA cannot alter the statutory allocation of natural resource damage claims under \u00a7 2706(a): only the sovereign that owns or actually manages\/controls the resource can recover for its injury. In their view, intergovernmental agreements cannot transform resources belonging solely to Puerto Rico into resources 'belonging to, managed by, or controlled by' the United States for purposes of OPA liability.",

They contend that material factual disputes exist regarding both whether the grounding posed a substantial threat of discharge and whether the United States manages or controls the injured resources. They assert that their Rule 56(d) request was timely and supported by a showing that discovery could produce evidence about the actual risk of discharge (including technical information about the ship\u2019s condition, weather, and sea state), the FOSC\u2019s decision\u2011making and documentation, and the federal government\u2019s actual management involvement with the specific reef resources.

They rely on Rule 9(h)(2)\u2019s express language and First Circuit precedent stating that an interlocutory order need not resolve all parties\u2019 rights and liabilities to be appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(3); it suffices that the order definitively adjudicates the merits of some claim or defense. They contend that the United States\u2019s arguments about who designated the case as admiralty, or about purported limits on treating third\u2011party claims as part of the 'case,' have no support in the relevant texts, and that treating this as an admiralty case for interlocutory appeal purposes does not affect any jury trial rights on non\u2011admiralty claims."

          "FOSC substantial\u2011threat determinations are entitled to APA\u2011style deference in OPA suits: The United States contends that Congress, through 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1321(c) and the National Contingency Plan (NCP), delegated to federal response officials (including the Coast Guard FOSC) the authority to decide when an occurrence presents a 'discharge' or a 'substantial threat of discharge' of oil, thereby triggering federal response duties. It argues that because OPA\u2019s liability provision, \u00a7 2702(a), is triggered by the existence of an 'incident' (including substantial threats), and because the federal response framework assumes that determination is made by the FOSC under the NCP, courts should treat the FOSC\u2019s substantial\u2011threat decision as an administrative determination. As such, in a later civil action under \u00a7 2702(a), the court\u2019s role should be to review that determination deferentially under the APA\u2019s arbitrary\u2011and\u2011capricious standard, based on the administrative record, rather than to re\u2011litigate the threat issue de novo.

It argues that these materials comprise the relevant administrative record and that, even if defendants dispute whether a formal determination was documented contemporaneously, the record as a whole shows that the FOSC reasonably treated the situation as a substantial threat. The United States contends that no contrary evidence in the summary judgment record undermined this conclusion, and thus, under arbitrary\u2011and\u2011capricious review, the district court correctly treated the substantial\u2011threat element as established.",

It argues that NOAA is a designated federal trustee for natural resources 'in, under, or using waters navigable by deep draft vessels,' including the area where the T\/V Margara grounded, under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.600(b)(1). It further contends that various federal statutes give NOAA and other federal agencies substantial management responsibilities for coral species, reef habitats, and associated fisheries and protected species in the region, including the Endangered Species Act, Magnuson\u2011Stevens Act, Coral Reef Conservation Act, and Coastal Zone Management Act, as well as Executive Order 13089 regarding coral reef protection. According to the United States, these statutes and implementing programs show that federal agencies exercise sufficient management and control over the affected resources to bring them within \u00a7 2706(a)(1), even if Puerto Rico also has significant interests and authority.",

It argues that the statute\u2019s definition of 'control' describes the rights that passed to Puerto Rico but does not purport to eliminate all federal management or regulatory authority over resources in those waters, nor does it preclude overlapping federal trusteeship under OPA. The United States also emphasizes that the National Contingency Plan contemplates coexisting or overlapping trusteeships where resources and jurisdictions overlap, and that NOAA and PRDNER have, in fact, acted as co\u2011trustees with respect to the damaged resources. It maintains that nothing in the Federal Relations Act prevents the United States from being a proper OPA trustee for the injured reef resources based on its statutory responsibilities.",
          "Co\u2011trusteeship and MOA support U.S. role as NRD claimant: The United States notes that NOAA and PRDNER executed a Memorandum of Agreement establishing co\u2011trusteeship and coordinated assessment and restoration activities for the T\/V Margara incident. It argues that, under OPA, trustees act 'on behalf of the public' for natural resources under their trusteeship, and that the co\u2011trusteeship confirms that the United States has trustee authority over the resources, including the right to recover damages in its own name. It asserts that OPA\u2019s structure, including subrogation provisions and its designation of federal trustees, supports allowing the United States to bring claims for natural resource damages even where a state or territory also has trustee authority over the same resources.",
          "Summary judgment appropriate without discovery because liability rested on legal issues and an established administrative record: The United States maintains that further discovery was unnecessary to resolve liability. It contends that the material facts \u2014 the grounding of a fully laden tanker on a reef, the absence of an actual spill but the risk it posed, and the resulting reef damage from response operations \u2014 were essentially undisputed. In its view, the remaining questions concerned legal interpretation: whether FOSC determinations receive APA deference and whether the federal government qualifies as a natural resource trustee under OPA for the damaged resources. It argues that, because the court\u2019s review of agency action is confined to the existing administrative record, civil discovery aimed at supplementing that record was unwarranted. Thus, it contends, the district court properly denied additional discovery and correctly granted partial summary judgment based on the existing record and governing legal standards.",
          "Interlocutory appeal barred for lack of admiralty jurisdiction: On appellate jurisdiction, the United States argues that \u00a7 1292(a)(3) should not apply because the main OPA claims were filed as ordinary civil claims, not as admiralty claims under Rule 9(h), and that the presence of admiralty\u2011designated third\u2011party claims should not re\u2011characterize the entire case as an 'admiralty case.' It contends that the word 'case' in \u00a7 1292(a)(3) should be limited to claims properly designated as admiralty by the plaintiff and that third\u2011party admiralty claims are ancillary and not sufficient to trigger interlocutory appeal rights as to non\u2011admiralty claims. It also argues that \u00a7 1292(a)(3) refers to 'the rights and liabilities of the parties' and should be read to require that the interlocutory order determine all parties\u2019 rights and liabilities in the admiralty case, which, according to the United States, the partial summary judgment order did not do, because it left unresolved the third\u2011party admiralty claims and the intervenor\u2019s claims."

          "reasoning":"The proper framework for the 'substantial threat of a discharge of oil' requirement in \u00a7 2702(a) is an issue of statutory construction and the elements of civil liability, reviewed de novo. OPA\u2019s liability provision does not say that a Coast Guard FOSC\u2019s threat determination is binding in later civil litigation or that courts must review it under APA arbitrary\u2011and\u2011capricious standards. Section 1321(c) allocates response authority and duties; it does not purport to define or conclusively determine civil liability. By contrast, \u00a7 2702(a) defines when a 'responsible party' is liable: only for costs and damages 'resulting from an incident,' and 'incident' expressly includes an 'occurrence' that 'results in a discharge or substantial threat of a discharge.' Nothing in the text or structure of OPA displaces the ordinary rule that a plaintiff must prove each liability element by a preponderance of the evidence, subject to the normal summary\u2011judgment standard. Cases applying APA review to the reasonableness of agency response costs concern whether particular expenditures qualify as recoverable 'removal' or 'remedial' actions, not whether the statutory trigger for liability exists. Treating the FOSC\u2019s real\u2011time judgment as evidentiary but not dispositive respects both his expertise and the statutory scheme. The district court therefore erred, as a matter of law, by converting the threat element into an agency determination reviewed deferentially rather than a fact question for the court (or jury) under the usual civil standard. That legal error infected the grant of summary judgment on liability, requiring reversal."

          "reasoning":"Whether the United States may recover natural resource damages for these particular coral reefs under \u00a7\u00a7 2702(a) and 2706(a)(1) is a mixed question of statutory interpretation and application to largely undisputed jurisdictional facts, reviewed de novo. OPA allows the United States to recover only for natural resources 'belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to the United States.' The Federal Relations Act, 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 749, grants Puerto Rico 'control'\u2014defined to encompass ownership and management rights\u2014over submerged lands and natural resources in the area of the grounding, absent a specific federal reservation. The record as summarized shows that Puerto Rico is the primary sovereign owner\/manager of the seabed and reef in question and that PRDNER has actively asserted trustee claims. The United States relies on NOAA\u2019s broad regulatory and conservation authorities, federal trustee designations in the NCP, and a co\u2011trustee MOA with Puerto Rico. But general regulatory jurisdiction and programmatic conservation responsibilities, by themselves, typically do not convert all regulated private or state resources into 'federal' resources for damages purposes. The case law analogizing CERCLA\u2019s similar trustee language (e.g., Ohio v. DOI) suggests that 'managed by' or 'controlled by' requires a concrete, resource\u2011specific management or control role that goes beyond background regulation. On the current record, the district court did not address, and the United States has not carried its burden to show as a matter of law that the specific coral reef resources at the Margara site 'belong to' or are 'managed by' or 'controlled by' the United States within \u00a7 2706(a)(1), as opposed to being Puerto Rico resources with some overlapping federal regulatory overlay. Because the district court effectively assumed a federal trustee entitlement without analysis and granted summary judgment on that premise, the liability ruling cannot stand. The proper course is to reverse and remand for the district court to apply the correct statutory test and, if necessary, to develop the factual record concerning the federal government\u2019s actual management or control, if any, over these specific resources."

          "reasoning":"Summary judgment is reviewed de novo, but the denial or effective denial of a Rule 56(d) request is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Here, the United States moved for partial summary judgment on liability before any merits discovery. Defendants timely invoked Rule 56(d), identifying specific factual areas where discovery could yield material evidence: (1) the actual degree of risk of a discharge\u2014technical information about the vessel\u2019s condition, hull integrity, weather, sea state, salvage options, and the FOSC\u2019s real\u2011time deliberations; and (2) the existence and extent of any federal management or control over the particular reef resources, including the presence of ESA\u2011listed species, any site\u2011specific federal management plans, and the operation of the co\u2011trustee relationship. These are not speculative or irrelevant; they go directly to disputed elements of OPA liability under the correct legal framework. First Circuit precedent disfavors granting summary judgment before the nonmovant has had a fair chance to conduct necessary discovery, especially where material facts are reasonably in dispute and the nonmovant has explained what discovery is needed and how it could affect the outcome. The district court, having adopted an APA\u2011record\u2011review paradigm for the 'substantial threat' question and essentially treating the federal trustee issue as a legal given, did not meaningfully address these Rule 56(d) proffers and proceeded to judgment on a skeletal record. Under the correct understanding that the United States bears the burden to prove both a substantial threat and its entitlement to recover for these specific resources, that approach was an abuse of discretion as to Rule 56(d) and erroneous as a matter of summary\u2011judgment law. The liability judgment must therefore be reversed and the case remanded for appropriate discovery and factual development."

      "reasoning":"Jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(3) is likely upheld because Rule 9(h)(2) expressly provides that any case including an admiralty\u2011designated claim is an 'admiralty case' for \u00a7 1292(a)(3) purposes, and First Circuit authority allows interlocutory review of orders finally determining a particular claim or defense even where other issues remain. Once jurisdiction is established, the core of the appeal concerns how OPA allocates decision\u2011making on the 'substantial threat' element and who may recover natural resource damages for the Margara reef. Nothing in OPA\u2019s text or structure authorizes courts to treat a FOSC\u2019s threat determination as outcome\u2011determinative agency action for civil liability; instead, that determination is probative evidence of risk but not a substitute for the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove an 'incident' by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court\u2019s reliance on APA arbitrary\u2011and\u2011capricious review of the FOSC\u2019s judgment short\u2011circuited that statutory scheme. Separately, the court granted the United States federal\u2011trustee standing for these corals without analyzing \u00a7 2706(a)(1)\u2019s limiting language in light of Puerto Rico\u2019s strong proprietary and management interests under the Federal Relations Act. On the record described, there are at least genuine factual and legal disputes as to whether the resources 'belong to' or are 'managed by' or 'controlled by' the United States, especially distinguishing general regulatory authority from true resource management. Coupled with the fact that summary judgment was granted before any merits discovery despite a detailed Rule 56(d) showing by defendants, the combination of misapplied legal standards and truncated factual development makes it likely the appellate court will reverse the partial summary judgment on liability and remand for application of the correct legal framework and for appropriate discovery. The net effect is a complete reversal of the interlocutory liability determination, while preserving interlocutory jurisdiction under \u00a7 1292(a)(3)."

A derivative is a contract whose price or payment terms derive from an underlying reference, such as an interest rate. Among the instruments at issue in this litigation are foreign exchange forwards, futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and interest-rate swaps that are priced or settled based on Sterling LIBOR.\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2014Richard Dennis (an individual), Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Ltd. (an investment fund), and FrontPoint European Fund L.P. (a limited partnership)\u2014traded in derivatives whose value was tied to Sterling LIBOR.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that several large banks, including UBS AG, Barclays Bank PLC, Co\u00f6peratieve Rabobank U.A., Lloyds Banking Group plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, Barclays Capital Inc., and Deutsche Bank AG, engaged in a long-running scheme to manipulate Sterling LIBOR in order to increase their profits from trading Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives. According to the consolidated amended complaint, traders at these banks sent electronic messages to their internal LIBOR submission teams requesting that they submit false Sterling LIBOR quotes that were higher or lower than the true competitive market rate, depending on the traders\u2019 positions in Sterling LIBOR-linked derivatives. The complaint alleges that traders coordinated both internally (between trading desks and their own banks\u2019 LIBOR submitters) and externally (with submitters and traders at other banks) to influence submissions.\n\nPlaintiffs further allege that defendants used inter-dealer brokers\u2014entities that act as intermediaries between banks\u2014to coordinate manipulative conduct. Through these communications and broker-assisted coordination, the defendants allegedly agreed to suppress, inflate, maintain, or otherwise alter Sterling LIBOR, rather than allowing it to reflect competitive market conditions.\n\nPlaintiffs contend that this conduct was driven by a conscious effort by senior management within the banks to increase profits from derivatives trading. The defendants allegedly facilitated and tolerated this misconduct in several ways: by issuing internal policies that encouraged collusion among traders and submitters; by adjusting organizational structures to increase communication between derivatives traders and LIBOR submitters; and by maintaining lax compliance and oversight standards. With respect to Deutsche Bank AG, plaintiffs allege that the bank misled financial regulators in the United Kingdom by concealing the results of a German regulatory report that criticized LIBOR manipulation.\n\nIn addition to alleged manipulation of the benchmark submissions themselves, plaintiffs assert that defendants distorted the relevant interest-rate markets through other practices, including borrowing and lending pounds sterling at above- or below-market rates, and placing false bids and offers regarding rates they were willing to pay or charge (a practice referred to as \"spoofing\"). These allegedly manipulative practices, according to plaintiffs, created \"artificial\" prices in Sterling LIBOR and in financial instruments whose payoff depended on Sterling LIBOR.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Plaintiffs filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, they asserted multiple federal and state claims arising out of the alleged manipulation of Sterling LIBOR and related derivatives markets. As relevant to the appeal:\n\n1. Sherman Act claims: Plaintiffs alleged that the defendant banks conspired to restrain trade and fix prices in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq. The alleged conspiracy involved submitting false Sterling LIBOR quotes, engaging in manipulative trading strategies, and coordinating conduct through brokers, all of which purportedly distorted Sterling LIBOR and the prices of Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives.\n\n2. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) claims: Plaintiffs, and ultimately only Richard Dennis as to the federal commodities claims, alleged that defendants rigged the prices of Sterling LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives in violation of Sections 6(c), 9, and 22 of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 13, and 25, by manipulating benchmark submissions and engaging in related trading practices.\n\n3. RICO claims: Plaintiffs asserted claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 et seq., alleging that defendants participated in an enterprise or enterprises that conducted or participated in a pattern of racketeering activity associated with LIBOR manipulation.\n\n4. State common-law claims: Plaintiffs brought state-law causes of action, including unjust enrichment and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, based on the same alleged course of conduct.\n\nDefendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, under Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction, and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court (Broderick, J.) issued two orders that, together, dismissed all of plaintiffs' claims.\n\nFirst order (substantive dismissal of core federal claims):\n- Antitrust standing: The court held that two of the plaintiffs\u2014Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Ltd. and Richard Dennis\u2014lacked antitrust standing to pursue Sherman Act claims. The court applied the \"efficient enforcer\" framework and concluded that, except for FrontPoint European Fund L.P., plaintiffs were not efficient enforcers of the antitrust laws. The court reasoned that Sonterra and Dennis had not bought or sold any Sterling LIBOR-based derivatives directly from the defendant banks and that their alleged damages were indirect, causally remote, and difficult to quantify.\n- CEA claims: As to the Commodity Exchange Act claims, which at that stage were being pursued only by Richard Dennis, the district court dismissed on two grounds. It held that the statute of limitations barred the CEA claims against some defendants, and that as to the remaining defendants, Dennis failed to plead the required specific intent to manipulate under the CEA.\n- RICO and state-law claims: The district court also dismissed the RICO causes of action and most of the state common-law claims (including unjust enrichment and implied covenant claims), although the detailed reasoning for each state-law claim is not fully set out in the excerpt.\n\nWhile the motion to dismiss was pending and before issuance of the first order, plaintiffs notified the district court that FrontPoint European Fund L.P. had wound down in 2012, nearly four years before the filing of the complaint.\n\nSecond order (capacity and assignment issues; remaining claims): After the first order, FrontPoint moved to substitute Fund Liquidation Holdings, LLC (\"FLH\") as plaintiff in its place, asserting that FrontPoint had assigned certain rights to sue to FLH. Approximately eight months later, the court issued a second order addressing this motion and FrontPoint\u2019s capacity.\n\nIn the second order, the district court concluded that FrontPoint did not assign to FLH the right to pursue the remaining Sherman Act and state-law claims against UBS AG. The court also held that FrontPoint itself lacked the capacity to sue in its own name at that point, given that it had been wound down years earlier. On that basis, the court dismissed the last surviving claims in the case.",

(through the attempted substitution of Fund Liquidation Holdings, LLC)\u2014timely appealed from the final judgment of the district court. On appeal, they challenge the dismissal of their federal Sherman Act and Commodity Exchange Act claims. They do not appear to pursue challenges to the dismissal of their RICO or state-law claims, other than as relevant background.\n\nUBS AG filed a timely cross-appeal, challenging aspects of the district court\u2019s rulings that were adverse to it, although the specific grounds of the cross-appeal are not detailed in the provided excerpt."

Antitrust injury is assessed through a three-step inquiry: (a) identify the challenged practice and why it is or might be anticompetitive; (b) identify the actual injury the plaintiff alleges, i.e., how the plaintiff is in a worse position because of the conduct; and (c) compare the anticompetitive effect of the practice with the injury alleged to determine if the injury is of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent. The injury must involve \"actual injury\" placing the plaintiff in a worse economic position, not just participation in a distorted market. Efficient-enforcer analysis considers (among other factors) the directness of the injury, the existence of more direct victims, and the speculative nature and complexity of damage calculations, but that aspect of the standard is principally part of the district court\u2019s ruling in this case."

He contends that the frequency and systemic nature of the manipulation make it plausible that his transactions were executed at distorted prices to his detriment, even if specific trades and amounts of loss are not identified in the complaint.",

They argue that damages, while complex, are capable of calculation using transaction data and benchmark movements.",
          "Dennis challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he failed to adequately plead specific intent under the CEA, asserting that the complaint details defendants\u2019 knowledge of and participation in manipulation, communications among traders and submitters, and documented regulatory findings that, in his view, support an inference of specific intent to create artificial prices.",

To the extent it does address them, the generalized allegations of industry\u2011wide misconduct and regulatory findings, without specific factual allegations tying each defendant\u2019s conduct to a purposeful attempt to move Sterling LIBOR in a particular direction to Dennis\u2019s detriment, are likely to be deemed insufficient to show specific intent. On limitations, extensive public reporting and regulatory actions regarding LIBOR manipulation emerged well before suit, which supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that at least some claims were untimely.

The district court also interpreted the assignment documents and found that FrontPoint did not clearly assign to Fund Liquidation Holdings, LLC the specific, remaining Sherman Act and state\u2011law claims against UBS. The record as described does not suggest any clear error in that contractual interpretation, and there is no indication that Rule 25 substitution could cure the lack of both capacity in FrontPoint and of a valid assignment to FLH.

That framework strongly supports affirmance on both the Sherman Act \u2018antitrust injury\u2019 and CEA \u2018actual damages\u2019 questions. Independently, the efficient\u2011enforcer factors disfavor indirect traders like Sonterra and Dennis, whose injuries are remote and difficult to apportion, especially in a complex derivatives market referencing a benchmark affected by many actors. Finally, the capacity and assignment issues concerning FrontPoint and FLH turn on organizational and contract law; the district court found no valid capacity or assignment, and nothing in the summary suggests a clear legal error in those determinations. Because each set of claims is dismissed on at least one solid, independently sufficient ground and the plaintiffs do not seriously press the RICO\/state\u2011law dismissals on appeal, the appellate court is likely to affirm the judgment in full, rendering UBS\u2019s cross\u2011appeal largely academic or subject to dismissal as moot."

Each began when an individual enrolled in a Martin's Point Medicare Advantage plan sought medical care while in Mexico and was admitted to one of the plaintiff hospitals (Hospital Amerimed Cancun or Hospital Quirurgica Del Sur). Upon admission, each enrollee signed a contract with the admitting hospital obligating the enrollee to pay for all services rendered. The enrollees also provided information about their Martin's Point medical insurance coverage.\n\nEach hospital then contacted Martin's Point through the same third\u2011party administrator to verify coverage. Martin's Point allegedly represented to the administrator that the enrollees had \"full medical insurance benefits\" for the proposed out\u2011of\u2011country emergency services. Based on those communications, the administrator generated verification\u2011of\u2011benefits forms for each enrollee stating that their benefits were \"unlimited.\"\n\nRelying on the understanding that the enrollees had unlimited coverage, the hospitals provided extensive medical treatment over a period of days. Partway through each patient's stay, Martin's Point sent letters authorizing the hospitalization for several days. These letters stated that the authorization was subject to Medicare coding requirements for coverage and that payment was based on the enrollee's eligibility and benefit coverage at the time of service.\n\nBy the time of discharge, the enrollees had incurred substantial medical bills: approximately $2,132,982.98 in one case and $512,464.00 in the other. The hospitals sought reimbursement from Martin's Point for the services rendered. Martin's Point took the position that, under the terms of the enrollees' Medicare Advantage plans, coverage for out\u2011of\u2011country medical services was capped at $25,000 per enrollee, and it refused to reimburse the hospitals beyond that limit.\n\nThe hospitals allege that they are foreign, non\u2011contracting providers with respect to Martin's Point (there is no alleged direct provider contract governing reimbursement terms), that the enrollees remain personally liable to them under the admission contracts for any unreimbursed amounts, and that they provided the treatment in reliance on the coverage representations transmitted through the third\u2011party administrator.",

Martin's Point also moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), contending that even if the claims were not characterized as Medicare benefits claims, the pleadings failed to state viable causes of action under Maine law.\n\nIn substantially identical memorandum opinions (Amerimed I and Quirurgica I), the district court described the Medicare administrative\u2011exhaustion framework and concluded that, despite being framed as state\u2011law tort and quasi\u2011contract claims, the hospitals' suits sought to have Martin's Point pay for services provided to Medicare Part C enrollees and therefore \"arose under\" Medicare. Because the hospitals had not pursued or completed the Medicare Part C administrative review process before filing in federal court, the court held that it lacked subject\u2011matter jurisdiction and granted Martin's Point's Rule 12(b)(1) motions, dismissing each case. The court did not reach the Rule 12(b)(6) arguments once it determined jurisdiction was lacking.\n\nThe hospitals then filed Rule 59(e) motions to alter or amend the judgments. They argued that, as foreign hospitals operating in Mexico and not qualifying as \"providers\" under Medicare Part C regulations, they could not participate in the Medicare Advantage administrative review process and therefore should be exempt from any exhaustion requirement. In a pair of follow\u2011up memorandum opinions (Amerimed II and Quirurgica II), the district court denied the Rule 59(e) motions. It reasoned that Martin's Point's refusal to reimburse beyond $25,000 constituted \"organization determinations\" under Medicare Part C, that such determinations are subject to mandatory administrative appeal, and that the hospitals had not provided persuasive legal authority showing that their foreign status legally precluded them from accessing or participating in the administrative process.

Part C regulations permit appeals by enrollees and by entities with certain appealable interests; beneficiaries here could challenge the organization determinations and thereby trigger administrative and judicial review of the coverage limits.

      },
      "factual_background":"Angel Tudor has worked for Whitehall Central School District for approximately 20 years, first as a substitute teacher and then as a high school math teacher. She suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to sexual harassment and sexual assault by a supervisor at a former workplace. Her PTSD symptoms affect her neurological functioning, interfere with daily tasks, induce a stutter that impedes communication, and cause severe nightmares that can result in vomiting. She takes multiple medications to manage these symptoms and has been admitted for psychiatric care related to PTSD three times.\n\nIn 2008, Tudor\u2019s PTSD symptoms escalated beyond what she could manage with therapy and medication alone. In consultation with her therapist, she sought and received an accommodation from Whitehall that permitted her to leave campus for one fifteen\u2011minute break during each of her morning and afternoon prep periods, when she had no responsibility for supervising students. She used these breaks to compose herself away from the school environment, which tended to trigger her PTSD symptoms.\n\nIn 2016, school administration changed and Whitehall instituted a policy prohibiting teachers from leaving school grounds during prep periods. When Tudor attempted to leave campus despite this new policy, she was reprimanded for insubordination. She informed the new administration of her longstanding accommodation, but administrators told her that the documentation on file was insufficient to establish her right to a reasonable accommodation. Rather than immediately supply additional documentation, Tudor took paid sick leave and then requested leave for the fall semester under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Her doctor described her condition as \u201cPTSD with severe anxiety and agitation.\u201d During this FMLA leave, Tudor was unable to teach and attended an intensive outpatient program five days a week to get her PTSD symptoms and anxiety under control.\n\nWhen Tudor returned from FMLA leave in January 2017, Whitehall modified her schedule. She was granted a morning break as requested, and, in the afternoon, she was allowed a break on days when a school librarian could watch her students. When a librarian was not available, Tudor could not take an afternoon break. This arrangement continued through the 2017\u201318 and 2018\u201319 school years. The adequacy of that accommodation is the subject of a separate lawsuit not at issue in this appeal.\n\nThe present suit concerns Tudor\u2019s schedule for the 2019\u201320 school year. Her schedule included a morning prep period and an afternoon study hall. During that year, neither the school librarian nor any other Whitehall employee was available to cover for Tudor for fifteen minutes during the afternoon study hall so that she could leave campus. Despite the lack of designated coverage or express authorization, Tudor left school grounds for a fifteen\u2011minute break during her afternoon study hall on 91 of the 100 school days before classes went remote due to the COVID\u201119 pandemic. There is no evidence that Whitehall administrators expressly authorized these afternoon breaks; Tudor testified that she considered herself to be violating school policy when she left, and that this perception heightened her anxiety.\n\nTudor contends that Whitehall\u2019s refusal to guarantee her a daily 15\u2011minute afternoon break during the 2019\u201320 school year, comparable to her earlier accommodation, exacerbated her PTSD\u2011related pain and anxiety. During discovery in this case, she acknowledged that even without additional accommodation she was able to perform the essential functions of her job, but she stated that she did so only \u201cunder great duress and harm.\u201d",

She asserted a failure\u2011to\u2011accommodate claim under the ADA and parallel state\u2011law claims.

Relying on a formulation of that element requiring proof that 'with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the job at issue,' the court reasoned that Tudor\u2019s admitted ability to perform the essential functions of her job without the requested accommodation meant she could not show entitlement to a reasonable accommodation.

The district court misread a shorthand formulation (\u201cwith reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could perform the essential functions\u201d) as imposing an additional requirement that the accommodation be strictly necessary to enable performance of essential functions. That interpretation conflicts with the statutory definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d and with the ADA\u2019s recognition that discrimination includes denying reasonable accommodations affecting the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, including schedule modifications, even where the employee can technically perform the job without them.\n\nHere, Tudor concedes she could perform her core teaching duties without the guaranteed afternoon break, but offers evidence that doing so substantially exacerbated her PTSD\u2011related pain and anxiety and that a consistent 15\u2011minute afternoon break was a reasonable schedule modification. Whether that break was a reasonable accommodation and whether Whitehall could show undue hardship are disputed fact\u2011intensive questions inappropriate for resolution on the ground that she could already do the job. By treating her ability to perform essential functions without the accommodation as dispositive of the entire claim, the district court applied an incorrect legal standard and thus erred in granting summary judgment. The proper course is to reverse and remand for further proceedings under the correct legal framework."

      "reasoning":"The appeal turns on a single, purely legal issue: whether the ADA allows an employer to defeat a failure\u2011to\u2011accommodate claim solely because the employee can perform the essential functions of the job without accommodation. The statutory text and the cited Second Circuit cases define a qualified individual as someone who can perform essential functions with or without accommodation, and separately impose a duty to provide reasonable accommodations absent undue hardship. Conditioning that duty on an inability to perform essential functions without the accommodation would effectively read the phrase \u201cwith or without reasonable accommodation\u201d out of the statute\u2019s definition and unduly narrow the scope of actionable discrimination in the terms and conditions of employment. \n\nGiven this conflict with the statutory framework and the way the elements of a prima facie claim are generally articulated in the Second Circuit, the appellate court is likely to hold that the district court misapplied the law and that an employee\u2019s ability to perform essential job functions without accommodation does not, as a matter of law, bar a failure\u2011to\u2011accommodate claim. That error directly supplied the basis for summary judgment, so the judgment should be reversed and the case remanded for consideration of reasonableness, causation, and any undue\u2011hardship defenses under the correct legal standard."

      "factual_background":"Brian Flores is a professional football coach who has been employed by several National Football League (NFL) member clubs. From 2008 to 2018, he worked for the New England Patriots; from 2019 to 2021, he was the head coach of the Miami Dolphins; in 2022, he was employed by the Pittsburgh Steelers as senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach; and beginning in 2023 he became the defensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nThe NFL is an unincorporated association of 32 member clubs. Its internal governance and the relationships among the league, the clubs, and club employees are set out in the NFL Constitution and Bylaws (the \"NFL Constitution\"). The NFL Constitution grants the NFL Commissioner broad authority over league affairs, including power to interpret and establish league policy and procedures, discipline clubs and employees, retain legal counsel, and exercise \"full, complete, and final jurisdiction and authority to arbitrate\" certain disputes, including disputes between a coach and a member club or clubs.\n\nAs a condition of his employment by NFL clubs, Flores entered into written employment agreements. Those contracts included (1) a club-specific arbitration clause requiring that disputes between Flores and the employing club be referred to the NFL Commissioner for binding arbitration under the NFL's Dispute Resolution Procedural Guidelines, and (2) an agreement to comply with and be bound by the NFL Constitution, incorporated by reference in its current form and as amended.\n\nIn January 2019, while still under contract with the New England Patriots, Flores interviewed with the Denver Broncos for their head coach position. He was not hired. Flores alleges that the Broncos' failure to hire him was because of racial discrimination, and that the interview was conducted as a \"sham\" solely to satisfy the NFL's Rooney Rule, which requires that minority and\/or female candidates be afforded interview opportunities for head coaching vacancies.\n\nIn February 2019, about one month after the Broncos interview, Flores was hired as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins.\n\nIn January 2022, after three seasons as the Dolphins' head coach, Flores was fired. After his termination, he interviewed for head coach positions with the New York Giants and the Houston Texans. He was not hired by either club. Flores alleges that the Giants and Texans failed to hire him because of racial discrimination and, in the case of the Texans, also in retaliation for his prior protected activity.\n\nIn February 2022, following those interviews, Flores was hired by the Pittsburgh Steelers as senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach. His Steelers employment agreement, like his earlier Patriots agreement, contained a club-specific arbitration provision and incorporated the NFL Constitution by reference.\n\nFlores and two other coaches, Steve Wilks and Ray Horton, allege that they and a putative class of similarly situated Black coaches and candidates were subjected to racially discriminatory hiring and employment practices by the NFL and member clubs, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and analogous state and local anti-discrimination laws. Flores's specific factual allegations include discriminatory failures to hire him as head coach by the Broncos, Giants, and Texans, and broader allegations that the NFL and its clubs engage in coordinated or joint discriminatory and retaliatory conduct.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In February 2022, Flores filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the NFL, the Denver Broncos, the New York Giants, and the Miami Dolphins. He alleged racial discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and related state and local anti-discrimination statutes, based primarily on alleged discriminatory hiring and employment practices. In April 2022, Flores filed a first amended complaint, adding claims against the Houston Texans and adding two additional plaintiffs: current NFL coach Steve Wilks, who asserted claims against the Arizona Cardinals, and former NFL coach Ray Horton, who asserted claims against the Tennessee Titans. The amended complaint alleged race discrimination and, in some instances, retaliation, under \u00a7 1981 and under state and local laws, and sought to proceed on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals.\n\nThe defendants (the NFL and relevant member clubs) moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs' claims. They contended that each plaintiff, including Flores, agreed to arbitrate disputes through the arbitration provisions in their various employment agreements with member clubs, which expressly incorporated the NFL Constitution and its arbitration provision. Defendants also argued that the NFL could enforce those arbitration agreements with respect to claims against the NFL itself, under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, because the plaintiffs alleged joint conduct by the NFL and the clubs.\n\nThe district court determined that the arbitration agreements in the NFL Constitution applied to certain claims against member clubs and to related claims against the NFL via equitable estoppel. It granted the motion to compel arbitration for: (1) Flores's claims against the Miami Dolphins and related claims against the NFL; (2) Wilks's claims against the Arizona Cardinals and related claims against the NFL; and (3) Horton's claims against the Tennessee Titans and related claims against the NFL.\n\nHowever, the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration as to Flores's claims against the Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Houston Texans, and his related claims against the NFL. As to the Broncos and related NFL claims, the court found that Flores's club-specific Patriots arbitration agreement did not cover disputes with the Broncos, and instead looked to the NFL Constitution's general arbitration provision (incorporated by reference into the Patriots agreement). The court held that, although that provision covered Flores's claims, it was illusory and unenforceable under Massachusetts law because the NFL and its member clubs had the unilateral ability to modify the terms of the NFL Constitution. The court therefore declined to compel arbitration of the Broncos-related and parallel NFL claims.\n\nAs to Flores's claims against the Giants and Texans and parallel claims against the NFL, defendants relied on Flores's 2022 employment agreement with the Steelers. They argued that this agreement, incorporating the NFL Constitution, governed and compelled arbitration of Flores's claims against those clubs and the NFL, even for conduct that predated the Steelers contract. Without reaching the question whether the Steelers agreement applied retroactively to those claims, the district court held that defendants had failed to establish the existence of a valid arbitration agreement because the version of the Steelers agreement submitted to the court did not bear the signature of the NFL Commissioner, who was required to approve such contracts. On this basis, the district court ruled that it would not compel arbitration of Flores's claims against the Giants and Texans and his related claims against the NFL.\n\nIn March 2023, both sides filed cross-motions for partial reconsideration of the March 1, 2023 order. Defendants argued that they had not been given notice that the absence of the Commissioner's signature on the Steelers agreement would be outcome-determinative, and they submitted a new copy of the agreement executed by the NFL Commissioner on June 17, 2022. On July 25, 2023, the district court denied both sides' motions for reconsideration, leaving in place its earlier rulings compelling arbitration as to the Dolphins, Cardinals, and Titans claims and refusing to compel arbitration as to Flores's claims against the Broncos, Giants, Texans, and related claims against the NFL.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court (Judge Valerie E. Caproni) granted in part and denied in part defendants' June 2022 motion to compel arbitration. It compelled arbitration of: (1) Flores's claims against the Miami Dolphins and his parallel claims against the NFL; (2) Wilks's claims against the Arizona Cardinals and his parallel claims against the NFL; and (3) Horton's claims against the Tennessee Titans and his parallel claims against the NFL. It denied the motion as to Flores's claims against the Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Houston Texans, and as to Flores's related claims against the NFL. For the Broncos and related NFL claims, the court concluded that the general arbitration provision in the NFL Constitution, though applicable by incorporation via the Patriots agreement, was illusory and unenforceable under Massachusetts law because the NFL and its clubs could unilaterally modify it. For the Giants, Texans, and related NFL claims, the court found that defendants had not shown a valid arbitration agreement because the Steelers contract provided to the court lacked the NFL Commissioner's signature. In July 2023, the district court denied defendants' motion for reconsideration, declining to change its prior analysis or result in light of the subsequently submitted signed copy of the Steelers agreement.",
        "what_is_appealed":"On August 21, 2023, the NFL, Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Houston Texans filed a notice of appeal limited to the portions of the March 1, 2023 order that declined to compel arbitration of Flores's claims against the Broncos, Giants, and Texans, and his related claims against the NFL, and to the district court's July 25, 2023 order denying defendants' motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs also filed a cross-appeal challenging the district court's decision compelling arbitration of Flores's claims against the Miami Dolphins, Wilks's claims against the Arizona Cardinals, and Horton's claims against the Tennessee Titans, but the Court of Appeals dismissed that cross-appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. As a result, only Flores's claims against the Broncos, Giants, Texans, and the parallel NFL claims, and the denial of reconsideration on those issues, are before the Court of Appeals."

          "Flores does not dispute that his Patriots and Steelers employment agreements purported to incorporate the NFL Constitution, nor that his claims against the Broncos and NFL fall within the literal scope of the NFL Constitution's arbitration clause as interpreted by the district court. However, he argues that the NFL Constitution's arbitration mechanism is unenforceable for multiple reasons, including that it is illusory and unconscionable under applicable state contract law and that it violates federal law principles governing arbitration of statutory claims.",
          "As to the Broncos and related NFL claims, Flores contends that the NFL Constitution's arbitration provision does not constitute a true arbitration agreement under the FAA because it vests unilateral substantive and procedural authority in the NFL Commissioner, who serves as the principal executive of the NFL and is therefore aligned with one of the adverse parties. He argues that this structure deprives him of an independent arbitral forum and bilateral dispute resolution, and that simply labeling such a process as 'arbitration' does not bring it within the FAA.",
          "Flores further argues, invoking the effective vindication doctrine, that compelling him to submit his federal statutory discrimination claims to the Commissioner's unilateral authority would operate as a prospective waiver of his right to pursue statutory remedies. In his view, the arrangement prevents him from effectively vindicating his \u00a7 1981 rights in an arbitral forum and thus is unenforceable even if considered an arbitration agreement.",
          "With respect to the Giants and Texans claims and the related NFL claims, Flores argues that defendants failed to meet their burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement through the Steelers contract because the version initially submitted lacked the NFL Commissioner's required approval and signature. He maintains that the district court properly refused to rely on an unsigned contract to compel arbitration and that defendants should not be allowed to cure this deficiency through a motion for reconsideration.",

He argues that the district court acted within its discretion in declining to revisit its earlier ruling on the basis of evidence that could have been presented with the original motion.",
          "Overall, Flores maintains that, even accepting that his employment contracts referenced the NFL Constitution, the specific arbitration scheme at issue is structurally biased and procedurally deficient, and therefore cannot lawfully be enforced to compel arbitration of his federal statutory discrimination claims against the Broncos, Giants, Texans, and the NFL."

          "reasoning":"Whether the NFL Constitution\u2019s dispute-resolution clause is illusory and thus an unenforceable arbitration agreement is a contract-law question tied to arbitrability, reviewed de novo. Modern federal appellate decisions, particularly under the FAA, are highly reluctant to invalidate arbitration provisions as illusory where there is any reasonably objective constraint on the drafter\u2019s amendment power and where the agreement has been applied in practice. Here, Flores does not dispute that, by virtue of his Patriots contract, the NFL Constitution\u2019s Section 8.3 on its face covers disputes between him and any member club, including the Broncos. The district court treated the Constitution as illusory because the NFL and clubs could unilaterally amend it, but appellate courts regularly hold that unilateral\u2011modification powers do not necessarily render arbitration provisions illusory if they are prospective only, subject to implied good\u2011faith limits, and\/or tethered to league governance rules. The likely appellate characterization is that this is a standard, enforceable league arbitration program, not a promise that can be revoked at will as to existing disputes. Additionally, generalized concerns about the Commissioner\u2019s impartiality or alleged unconscionability are typically addressed by enforcing the agreement and allowing later, case\u2011specific challenges if the process proves fundamentally unfair, rather than by preemptively voiding the clause. Given the FAA\u2019s strong presumption in favor of arbitration, the court of appeals is likely to reject the district court\u2019s illusory\u2011contract rationale and compel arbitration of the Broncos claims and the related NFL claims (which are factually intertwined and thus reachable by equitable estoppel)."

          "reasoning":"The existence and scope of the Steelers arbitration agreement are also questions of arbitrability reviewed de novo. The district court held there was no valid agreement because the copy submitted with the original motion lacked the Commissioner\u2019s signature, which the court viewed as a condition of contract formation. On appeal, however, the focus is not on what document was first filed below, but on whether, as a matter of state contract law, there in fact was a binding agreement to arbitrate between Flores and the Steelers that incorporates the NFL Constitution. By the time of reconsideration, defendants had produced a version of the Steelers contract executed by the Commissioner on June 17, 2022. There is no serious dispute that Flores signed the agreement and thereafter worked for the Steelers, receiving pay and benefits, thereby ratifying and performing under the contract. Appellate courts routinely hold that technical noncompliance with internal approval formalities (such as a missing league sign\u2011off) does not negate contract formation as to the employee where both sides performed. As to scope, league\u2011wide employment agreements of this kind, covering \u201cany dispute\u201d arising out of employment, are commonly interpreted to reach discrimination claims concerning prior hiring processes among league clubs, particularly where the contract is in force before suit is filed and the language is broad or forward\u2011looking. Given the FAA\u2019s directive to resolve doubts in favor of arbitration and the remedial context, the appellate court is likely to conclude that (1) a valid Steelers arbitration agreement exists, (2) it incorporates the NFL Constitution\u2019s arbitration regime, and (3) it covers Flores\u2019s claims against the Giants and Texans and the related NFL claims. The denial of the motion to compel arbitration on the ground that defendants failed to prove a valid agreement is therefore likely to be reversed."

The district court also could reasonably find that the absence of the Commissioner\u2019s signature was an apparent defect on the face of the document, so defendants had at least constructive notice that they bore the risk of relying on an incomplete instrument. Even if the court of appeals disagrees with the district court\u2019s underlying arbitrability analysis, it does not follow that the failure to grant reconsideration was outside the permissible range of decisions; appellate courts often reverse on the merits while still affirming the handling of a reconsideration motion.

Flores argues that the Commissioner\u2019s dual role as league executive and sole arbitrator renders the process non\u2011arbitral, structurally biased, and a prospective waiver of \u00a7 1981 rights. However, Supreme Court and circuit authority broadly construe \u2018arbitration agreements\u2019 to include a wide range of bespoke, institution\u2011specific forums, including employer\u2011designed programs and in\u2011house or industry\u2011based decisionmakers, so long as the agreement provides a mechanism for resolving disputes and does not on its face bar vindication of statutory rights. Challenges based on alleged partiality of the arbitrator or procedural unfairness are ordinarily addressed ex post under FAA \u00a7\u00a7 10\u201311 after an award issues, not by invalidating the agreement at the threshold. The NFL\u2019s process, while unusual, still designates an identified neutral (the Commissioner, or a designee) to hear evidence and render a binding award, and does not explicitly foreclose statutory remedies or impose prohibitive costs. Given the strong federal policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements and reluctance to expand the \u2018effective vindication\u2019 doctrine, the appellate court is likely to hold that the NFL Constitution mechanism is indeed an arbitration agreement within the FAA and is not invalid on its face as illusory, unconscionable, or a prospective waiver of federal discrimination claims.

      "reasoning":"The appeal squarely implicates the FAA\u2019s pro\u2011arbitration framework and the enforceability of league\u2011wide employment arbitration regimes. Appellate courts have consistently enforced broad arbitration clauses in professional sports leagues, including provisions appointing a commissioner or league official as arbitrator, and have been hesitant to deem such provisions \u2018illusory\u2019 solely because the league retains modification authority. Likewise, technical defects in the initial record (such as submitting an unsigned copy of a contract that plainly exists and has been performed under) are unlikely, on de novo review, to defeat arbitrability when later evidence confirms a valid agreement. For those reasons, the district court\u2019s core merits determinations on Issues 1, 2, and 4\u2014refusing to compel arbitration of Flores\u2019s claims against the Broncos, Giants, Texans, and the related claims against the NFL\u2014are likely to be reversed, and arbitration compelled for those claims.\n\nBy contrast, the reconsideration ruling stands on different footing. Under the abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion standard, the district court had leeway to insist that all evidence supporting arbitration be presented in the original motion, and to conclude that the signed Steelers agreement was not \u2018newly discovered\u2019 but rather material that could and should have been submitted earlier. Appellate courts often affirm such procedural rulings even while correcting the underlying legal analysis on appeal. Thus, while the ultimate outcome will be that all of Flores\u2019s contested claims are sent to arbitration, the district court\u2019s separate denial of reconsideration is likely to be affirmed, producing a mixed overall disposition: reversal on the substantive arbitrability issues and affirmance on the reconsideration ruling."

      "factual_background":"Alexandra E. Melino began working as a registered nurse in Boston Medical Center\u2019s (BMC) Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CCU) in 2014. Her primary duties were to provide direct care to critically ill patients and to coordinate with their families. In fulfilling these duties, she worked in close proximity to physicians, four to eight other nurses, two certified nursing assistants, and other staff. She also at times worked shifts in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.\n\nIn March 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, BMC converted several units, including Melino\u2019s CCU, into COVID-19 units to handle an overwhelming influx of seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Between January 31, 2020, and July 31, 2021, BMC treated 3,281 patients for COVID-19. BMC reports that it was short\u2011staffed during this period and that \"several hundred\" BMC staff members reported contracting COVID\u201119. Based on its experience, BMC determined that its healthcare providers were more likely than the general population to contract COVID\u201119 because of their greater exposure and that they were at increased risk of spreading the virus to medically vulnerable patients susceptible to serious complications and death. BMC concluded that any increased risk of in\u2011hospital COVID\u201119 transmission would negatively affect its ability to provide critical care by further reducing available staff.\n\nTo address these risks, BMC adopted recommendations from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stating that vaccination was the best way to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death, and to reduce COVID\u201119 transmission. Soon after COVID\u201119 vaccines became available to healthcare workers in January 2021, BMC began offering vaccination to its employees.\n\nOn August 21, 2021, BMC implemented a written immunization policy requiring all individuals working or volunteering at BMC locations to be immunized against COVID\u201119 in accordance with CDC guidelines. The policy allowed individuals to request medical or religious exemptions. It provided that individuals who did not comply would be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nOn September 9, 2021, Melino submitted a request for a religious exemption from the COVID\u201119 vaccination requirement, seeking to continue working in her existing job while remaining unvaccinated. On September 24, 2021, BMC sent her a questionnaire requesting additional information about her exemption request. When Melino returned the questionnaire, she repeated only her request for a religious exemption and declined to provide the other requested information.\n\nOn October 7, 2021, BMC notified Melino that her exemption request had been denied and that her employment would be terminated if she did not comply with the vaccination requirement by October 15, 2021. Melino did not attempt to engage in an interactive process with BMC to explore alternative accommodations and did not request any accommodation short of a complete exemption from the vaccination requirement. She did not become vaccinated, and BMC terminated her employment on October 15, 2021.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Melino sued BMC in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that BMC violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151B by denying her request for a religious exemption from BMC\u2019s August 21, 2021 COVID\u201119 vaccination policy and terminating her employment when she refused to be vaccinated. The core theory was that BMC failed to reasonably accommodate her asserted religious beliefs and that its refusal was not justified by undue hardship.",
        "district_court_decision":"After discovery, BMC moved for summary judgment, supported by an extensive affidavit from John M. Hickey, on two grounds: (1) that Melino had not established that she held a bona fide religious belief, and (2) that even if she had such a belief, granting her requested exemption would impose an undue hardship on the hospital. Melino opposed the motion, arguing that there were genuine disputes of material fact concerning the efficacy of the COVID\u201119 vaccines in reducing infection and transmission, and contending that BMC had not adequately shown that the vaccines \"worked.\" She submitted, among other things, a publicly available May 10, 2021 letter from Rear Admiral Denise M. Hinton of the Food and Drug Administration to Pfizer Inc. concerning emergency use authorization for the Pfizer\u2011BioNTech COVID\u201119 vaccine. The district court concluded that it would address only the undue hardship defense rather than the question of whether Melino\u2019s beliefs were bona fide. It determined that certain facts were undisputed, including that Melino\u2019s job involved direct patient care and could not be performed remotely; that she could not work in person while unvaccinated without risking the health and safety of her patients; and that any feasible accommodation would impose substantial increased costs on BMC. The court also found the record devoid of admissible evidence supporting Melino\u2019s contention that the COVID\u201119 vaccines did not \"work\" and treated BMC as entitled to summary judgment on the ground that granting Melino\u2019s requested complete exemption from vaccination would impose an undue hardship.\n\nSeparately, Melino moved to strike portions of Hickey\u2019s affidavit that referred to BMC\u2019s reliance on CDC recommendations, arguing that those portions constituted inadmissible hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(c). The district court denied the motion to strike because Melino had not complied with Local Rule 7.1(a)(2) of the District of Massachusetts, which requires certification that counsel conferred in good faith to resolve or narrow the issues before filing a motion. The court also reasoned that the CDC\u2019s recommendations and the medical and statistical information on which they were based were subject to judicial notice.",
        "what_is_appealed":"On appeal, Melino challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of BMC on her Title VII and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B religious accommodation claims, specifically the determination that her requested exemption from BMC\u2019s COVID\u201119 vaccination requirement would have imposed an undue hardship on the hospital. She also appeals the district court\u2019s order denying her motion to strike portions of the Hickey affidavit that referenced CDC recommendations."

          "BMC maintains that it relied on objective, scientific information and public\u2011health guidance, particularly the CDC\u2019s recommendations that healthcare personnel be vaccinated against COVID\u201119 because vaccination reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, death, and transmission. It notes that its vaccine policy was based on such guidance and that the record includes materials, including the FDA letter cited by Melino, showing high reported rates of vaccine effectiveness.",

          "reasoning":"The grant of summary judgment on the Title VII and ch. 151B religious accommodation claims is reviewed de novo. The only accommodation Melino ever requested was a complete exemption from vaccination while continuing her in\u2011person CCU duties; she refused to provide additional information, proposed no alternatives, and declined to engage in any interactive process. Under Groff, BMC had to show that this requested accommodation would impose a substantial burden in the overall context of its business. The undisputed facts show that: (1) Melino provided direct, hands\u2011on care to highly vulnerable ICU patients in a setting that could not be made remote; (2) BMC experienced high COVID caseloads, staffing shortages, and infections among staff; and (3) BMC adopted and reasonably relied on contemporaneous CDC and FDA guidance indicating that vaccination significantly reduces infection, severe disease, and transmission, especially in healthcare settings. Melino\u2019s opposition rested on generalized attacks on vaccine efficacy and two online articles and the FDA EUA letter; the district court correctly treated the online articles as inadmissible hearsay and noted that the FDA letter, on its face, reported high efficacy and stated that benefits outweighed risks. She offered no competent medical or epidemiological evidence in the record creating a genuine dispute that vaccination reduced infection and transmission risk in this context, and thus did not rebut BMC\u2019s showing that allowing an unvaccinated ICU nurse to treat critically ill patients would materially increase risks to patients and staff and exacerbate staffing problems. Groff requires a substantial burden, not certainty of perfect effectiveness, and courts generally defer to an employer\u2019s reliance on mainstream public\u2011health guidance when supported by record evidence. Her attempt on appeal to reframe the case around hypothetical alternative accommodations was not preserved: she neither requested nor developed any specific alternative accommodation in the administrative process or in the district court, and appellate courts do not entertain such theories for the first time on appeal. On this record, no reasonable jury could find that a full exemption in a high\u2011risk ICU during the height of the pandemic would not impose an undue hardship, so summary judgment was properly granted."

The district court denied the motion primarily because counsel failed to include the mandatory Local Rule 7.1(a)(2) certification of a good\u2011faith conference. First Circuit precedent gives district courts broad latitude to insist on strict compliance with local rules; enforcing that rule by denying a non\u2011compliant motion is well within the permissible range. On appeal Melino largely reprises her hearsay argument and does not meaningfully contest the Local Rule ground, effectively forfeiting any serious challenge to that independent basis for denial. In any event, the district court\u2019s alternative merits rationale is also within its discretion: Hickey\u2019s references to CDC guidance were admissible to show BMC\u2019s state of mind and reasons for adopting the vaccine policy (effect on the listener), not to prove the truth of the CDC\u2019s underlying scientific assertions, so they were not hearsay. Moreover, CDC guidance and related public\u2011health pronouncements are proper subjects of judicial notice. Because there was no abuse of discretion on either the procedural or evidentiary rationale, and any error would be harmless given the robust remaining record supporting undue hardship, the denial of the motion to strike is affirmed."

Melino did not place any of these core facts in genuine dispute with admissible evidence; instead she mounted a generalized challenge to vaccine efficacy without competent counter\u2011evidence, while demanding certainty rather than the substantial\u2011burden showing Groff requires. She also limited the case to a categorical exemption request and failed to preserve any concrete alternative\u2011accommodation theory. Under a de novo standard, those circumstances strongly favor affirmance. On the evidentiary\/motion\u2011to\u2011strike issue, the district court relied on a clear local\u2011rule violation and offered a legally sound alternative basis; abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion review makes reversal particularly unlikely.

      },
      "factual_background":"\u00c1ngel Forteza-Garc\u00eda was indicted in the District of Puerto Rico in March 2003. The indictment charged him with five counts, of which Count One and Count Three are relevant here.\n\nCount One charged Forteza with aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114(a). Although \u00a7 2114(a) is often referred to as the federal mail robbery statute because it criminalizes the robbery of custodians of United States mail, it also reaches the robbery of any person who has lawful charge of money or other property of the United States. The indictment alleged that Forteza and his codefendants assaulted a government informant, who had lawful custody of money provided by the government for the purpose of a controlled purchase of a firearm. The alleged purpose of the assault was to rob the informant of that money. Count One further alleged that, in effecting or attempting to effect this robbery, the victim was wounded and his life was put in jeopardy when he was shot several times, which resulted in his death. Those allegations tracked the aggravated portion of \u00a7 2114(a), which increases the penalty where, in effecting or attempting to effect the robbery, the custodian is wounded or his life is put in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon.\n\nCount Three charged Forteza with aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j). Section 924(j) makes it a crime to cause the death of a person through the use of a firearm in the course of committing a violation of \u00a7 924(c). Section 924(c), in turn, criminalizes using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of such an offense. Count Three alleged that the \u00a7 2114(a) offense described in Count One was committed by possessing, using, or carrying a firearm during and in relation to that crime of violence, and that in the course of that crime of violence the victim was unlawfully killed with malice aforethought through the use of a firearm, by knowingly, willfully, deliberately, maliciously, and with premeditation shooting the victim and causing his death.\n\nForteza pleaded guilty in September 2003 to only Count Three, the \u00a7 924(j) count, which by its terms realleged and incorporated by reference the \u00a7 2114(a) conduct described in Count One. In exchange, the government agreed to drop the remaining four charges, including the \u00a7 2114(a) count, and to recommend a sentence below the statutory maximum for a \u00a7 924(j) violation. He was sentenced to 324 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release. The change-of-plea colloquy and plea agreement materials showed that Count Three identified its predicate crime of violence as assaulting an individual who lawfully had charge or custody of United States money with intent to rob, steal, or purloin that money, as set forth in Count One, and that Count One alleged the victim was wounded and his life put in jeopardy by being shot several times, causing his death.\n\nThe later collateral challenge centers on the statutory definition of a \"crime of violence\" in \u00a7 924(c)(3), which includes, under the \"force clause\" in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), any felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, and formerly included, under the \"residual clause\" in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), felonies that by their nature involve a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"After his 2003 guilty plea and sentencing on Count Three (\u00a7 924(j)), Forteza pursued a direct appeal of his conviction and sentence, which was unsuccessful. In 2006, he filed his first motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the District of Puerto Rico. That petition asserted that his conviction and sentence were unconstitutional based on prosecutorial misconduct, judicial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied that initial \u00a7 2255 petition, and Forteza did not appear to appeal that ruling.\n\nIn 2017, Forteza sought authorization from the First Circuit to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition. He asserted that his \u00a7 924(j) conviction was unconstitutional in light of intervening Supreme Court precedent, specifically United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. 445 (2019). Davis held that the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3)'s crime-of-violence definition \u2014 covering felonies that by their nature involve a substantial risk that physical force may be used \u2014 was unconstitutionally vague. Forteza argued that, in light of Davis, his predicate offense for \u00a7 924(j) could only qualify as a crime of violence, if at all, under the force clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), and that the predicate offense here, a \u00a7 2114(a) offense, did not meet the force-clause definition.\n\nThe First Circuit granted permission in 2020 for Forteza to file this second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition. He then filed the \u00a7 2255 motion now at issue, contending that his \u00a7 924(j) conviction was unconstitutional under Davis because the underlying \u00a7 2114(a) offense did not categorically have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force as required by \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).",
        "district_court_decision":"On the second \u00a7 2255 petition, the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico determined that the \u00a7 2114(a) offense forming the predicate for Forteza's \u00a7 924(j) conviction was an aggravated variant of the \u00a7 2114(a) crime and that this aggravated variant necessarily included as an element the use of physical force sufficient to satisfy \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)'s force clause. The court concluded that, based on the indictment and plea materials, Forteza's conviction rested on a \u00a7 2114(a) offense involving wounding and placing the victim's life in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon. The district court further noted that, under binding First Circuit precedent, any argument that a conviction predicated on aiding and abetting such an offense would not qualify under the force clause was foreclosed. The district court therefore denied the \u00a7 2255 petition and also denied a certificate of appealability.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Forteza appealed from the district court's denial of his second \u00a7 2255 petition, challenging the conclusion that his \u00a7 924(j) conviction remains valid after Davis. On appeal, he contests the district court's determination that his predicate \u00a7 2114(a) offense was the aggravated form of mail robbery, that this aggravated form qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)'s force clause, and that aiding and abetting that offense does not alter its status as a crime of violence. He also appeals the denial of a certificate of appealability, which the Court of Appeals subsequently granted limited to his Davis-based challenge to the constitutionality of his \u00a7 924(j) conviction."

Davis invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)'s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague, the predicate offense for his \u00a7 924(j) conviction must qualify as a crime of violence under the force clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). He contends that his underlying \u00a7 2114(a) offense does not satisfy that clause because \u00a7 2114(a) does not, in all of its forms, have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.",
          "He asserts that \u00a7 2114(a), as relevant here, delineates only two offenses: a simple, indivisible variant defined by the language before the semicolon (assaulting, robbing, or attempting to rob a custodian of federal property with intent to rob or steal) and an aggravated, indivisible variant defined by all of the language following the semicolon (wounding, putting life in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon, or committing a subsequent offense). In his view, the aggravated variant can be committed either by wounding or jeopardizing the victim's life during a robbery or by merely committing the simple mail robbery offense more than once, which he argues can occur without the degree of force required by \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Thus, even the aggravated variant is not categorically a crime of violence.",
          "He contends that the record does not clearly show that his predicate \u00a7 2114(a) offense was the aggravated form. Because he pleaded guilty only to Count Three (\u00a7 924(j)), and Count Three does not, on its face, set out the aggravating elements of wounding or putting life in jeopardy under \u00a7 2114(a), he argues that his offense must be treated as premised on the simple form of \u00a7 2114(a), which he says does not require the requisite level of physical force.",
          "He further argues that any references to a firearm, shooting, and the victim\u2019s death in Count Three relate only to the elements of the \u00a7 924(j) offense (causing death through use of a firearm in the course of a \u00a7 924(c) violation) and not to any aggravating element of the \u00a7 2114(a) predicate. He maintains that the \u00a7 924(j) elements should not be conflated with \u00a7 2114(a)'s aggravated offense elements.",
          "He disputes that the text of Count One is properly incorporated into Count Three for purposes of identifying the predicate offense. Even if it is incorporated, he maintains that Count One does not, in his view, clearly establish which specific form of \u00a7 2114(a) he was convicted of, or that any particular aggravating circumstance was necessarily admitted in his guilty plea.",
          "He contends that the aggravated variant of \u00a7 2114(a) is indivisible as between wounding, placing the victim's life in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon, and committing a subsequent offense of mail robbery. Because, in his reading, one way of committing the aggravated variant (subsequent offense) does not require violent force, he argues that the entire aggravated variant cannot be treated as a categorical crime of violence.",
          "He argues that because his \u00a7 2114(a) liability was based on aiding and abetting rather than acting as a principal, the offense, as applied to him, should not be treated as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). He suggests that aiding-and-abetting liability can be premised on conduct that does not itself involve the direct use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent physical force, thereby undermining the classification of his conviction as a crime of violence.",
          "He asserts that to succeed on his Davis-based \u00a7 2255 challenge, he need only show that the predicate offense could be committed without the requisite force, emphasizing the categorical nature of the inquiry, and he maintains that he has done so with respect to \u00a7 2114(a) as he interprets it."

          "The government argues that \u00a7 2114(a) is a divisible statute that sets out multiple distinct offenses. In its view, the text before the semicolon encompasses three simple variants: (1) robbery of a custodian of federal property, (2) assault of such a custodian with intent to rob, and (3) attempted robbery. The text after the semicolon sets out at least two distinct aggravated variants corresponding to (a) wounding the custodian while committing or attempting to commit the simple offense and (b) putting the custodian's life in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon while committing or attempting to commit the simple offense. The reference to a subsequent offense, the government contends, is a sentencing factor enhancing punishment for any \u00a7 2114(a) offense based on recidivism, not a separate offense element.",
          "From this framework, the government contends that the robbery-based, wounding-based, and putting-life-in-jeopardy-based \u00a7 2114(a) offenses each has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent physical force. Therefore, each of those variants qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)'s force clause. The government maintains that, so long as Forteza's predicate offense was one of these variants, it can properly support his \u00a7 924(j) conviction.",
          "The government contends that the Shepard documents, including the indictment and plea record, show that Forteza's predicate \u00a7 2114(a) offense was an aggravated variant involving wounding the victim and putting his life in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon. It emphasizes that Count Three expressly identifies the predicate crime of violence as the \u00a7 2114(a) assault 'as set forth in Count One,' and that Count One specifically alleges that the victim was wounded and his life was put in jeopardy by being shot several times, causing his death. The government argues that this incorporation by reference makes clear which elements formed the basis of the conviction.",
          "The government maintains that the plea agreement's integration clause does not preclude reliance on the indictment language because Count Three, which is part of the plea, expressly incorporates Count One's allegations. Therefore, the aggravating elements of wounding and placing the victim's life in jeopardy are within the four corners of the plea and were necessarily admitted by Forteza when he pleaded guilty to Count Three.",
          "It argues that, under prior Circuit precedent, the aggravated portion of \u00a7 2114(a) (wounding or putting the victim\u2019s life in jeopardy by a dangerous weapon) is divisible from the other statutory components and qualifies categorically as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). The government contends that any argument to the contrary has already been rejected by the Circuit and that Forteza has not developed a new basis to distinguish his case.",
          "As to aiding-and-abetting liability, the government relies on binding Circuit precedent holding that aiding and abetting a crime of violence is itself a crime of violence because an aider and abettor is punishable as a principal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and must share the requisite intent and facilitate the commission of the substantive offense. It asserts that this precedent forecloses any argument that the aiding-and-abetting nature of Forteza's predicate \u00a7 2114(a) offense removes it from the crime-of-violence category.",
          "The government argues overall that, even after Davis, Forteza\u2019s \u00a7 924(j) conviction remains valid because the predicate \u00a7 2114(a) offense, as shown in the record, falls squarely within \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)'s force clause, and that the district court correctly applied the categorical and modified categorical approaches in reaching that conclusion."

Forteza pled guilty to Count Three as drafted; there is no indication that any part of these incorporated allegations was disclaimed or modified at the plea. On this record, the finding that the predicate was the aggravated \u00a7 2114(a) variant involving wounding and jeopardy to life by a dangerous weapon is not clearly erroneous.

The structure of \u00a7 2114(a) and the government\u2019s reading align with how courts have generally treated similar robbery statutes: the basic offense (rob\/assault\/attempt to rob a custodian of federal property) is set out before the semicolon; distinct aggravated offenses (wounding the victim, or putting the victim\u2019s life in jeopardy by use of a dangerous weapon during the basic offense) appear after the semicolon; and the \u2018subsequent offense\u2019 language functions as a recidivist enhancement rather than a separate, non\u2011violent means of committing an aggravated offense. Prior First Circuit precedent has treated the aggravated portion (wounding\/putting life in jeopardy by a dangerous weapon) as divisible and as defining a separate aggravated offense. In light of that precedent and the statute\u2019s text and penalties, the panel will almost certainly hold that the aggravated variants are divisible from the simple offense and that the \u201csubsequent offense\u201d clause is a sentencing factor, not an alternative non\u2011violent element.

The aider and abettor must share the requisite intent and facilitate the commission of the underlying violent offense; the inquiry for \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) focuses on the elements of that offense, not on whether a particular accomplice personally performed the violent act. The district court correctly treated Forteza\u2019s aiding\u2011and\u2011abetting conviction under \u00a7 2114(a) as no different from a principal conviction for crime\u2011of\u2011violence purposes."

The Shepard documents make clear that the predicate was an aggravated \u00a7 2114(a) offense in which the custodian of federal funds was shot several times, wounding him and putting his life in jeopardy, causing death. Under the modified categorical approach, that aggravated variant is properly isolated and treated as a distinct offense. The aggravated wounding\/jeopardy\u2011by\u2011weapon variant of \u00a7 2114(a) necessarily involves the use of violent physical force and thus qualifies under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u2019s force clause. First Circuit precedent supports both the divisibility of \u00a7 2114(a) and the treatment of its aggravated portion as a categorical crime of violence, as well as the rule that aiding and abetting such a crime remains a crime of violence.

      "factual_background":"Angel Diaz has been in the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) since September 5, 1990. In mid\u20112020, during the COVID\u201119 pandemic, Diaz was incarcerated at Sullivan Correctional Facility in Fallsburg, New York. Proceeding pro se, Diaz filed a federal habeas corpus petition on July 3, 2020, alleging that his continued incarceration in DOCCS custody during the COVID\u201119 pandemic subjected him to unconstitutional conditions of confinement. Diaz asserted that, because of the \"fundamental nature\" of DOCCS prison environments, he and other prisoners were being \"deliberately unnecessarily placed\" at risk of contracting COVID\u201119. He alleged that the physical layout and operation of New York state prisons made it impossible for inmates to practice effective social distancing or otherwise comply with public health measures necessary to mitigate the spread of COVID\u201119. Diaz claimed he had high blood pressure and morbid obesity, conditions he alleged placed him at heightened risk of serious harm or death if he contracted COVID\u201119. He contended that DOCCS had no plan to protect medically vulnerable inmates like him and that it would be \"virtually impossible\" for DOCCS to operate any of its facilities in a manner that would adequately protect him from COVID\u2011related risks. Based on those allegations, Diaz claimed that no DOCCS facility could constitutionally confine him during the pandemic and that the only adequate remedy for the alleged Eighth Amendment violations was his immediate release from DOCCS custody.",

        "claims_brought":"On July 3, 2020, Diaz filed a pro se petition in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, seeking a writ of habeas corpus. He asserted that his incarceration in DOCCS facilities during the COVID\u201119 pandemic violated the Eighth Amendment because the State could not provide constitutionally adequate conditions of confinement in any of its facilities, given his medical vulnerabilities and the alleged impossibility of ensuring safe COVID\u201119 mitigation measures in prison. He requested immediate release from custody as the sole remedy. Diaz simultaneously pursued a state habeas petition and, while he exhausted his state remedies, the federal petition was stayed.",
        "district_court_decision":"After Diaz exhausted state remedies, the federal District Court (Judge Rom\u00e1n) lifted the stay and referred the \u00a7 2254 petition to a magistrate judge. The magistrate judge recommended that the petition be denied on the ground that Diaz\u2019s claim was not cognizable in habeas corpus and instead had to be brought, if at all, as a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because it challenged only conditions of confinement rather than the validity or duration of his conviction or sentence. Diaz objected to the recommendation. The District Court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s reasoning and held that Diaz\u2019s petition did not state a cognizable habeas claim because he was not challenging the validity of his confinement or the duration of his sentence; rather, he was complaining about the circumstances and conditions of confinement. The court indicated that to the extent Diaz sought relief other than release from custody based on those allegations, he could pursue such relief in a separate \u00a7 1983 civil action. The District Court dismissed the \u00a7 2254 petition and denied Diaz a certificate of appealability.",

The Second Circuit granted a certificate of appealability in 2023, limited to the question whether the District Court properly concluded that Diaz\u2019s request for release from prison, based on alleged unconstitutional conditions of confinement, must proceed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and not under habeas corpus. After the certificate was granted and Diaz, now represented by appointed counsel, filed his opening brief, Sullivan Correctional Facility was closed and Diaz was transferred to Sing Sing Correctional Facility. The State did not seek prior permission from the Court of Appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(a) before transferring Diaz. The case caption initially continued to name the former Sullivan superintendent as respondent; the Court later directed the Clerk to amend the caption to substitute the Superintendent of Sing Sing as respondent. On appeal, there were also threshold disputes about mootness in light of Diaz\u2019s transfer and the closing of Sullivan, and about whether Diaz\u2019s originally pro se petition properly alleged a system\u2011wide challenge to confinement in any DOCCS facility or instead challenged only conditions at Sullivan."

          "Diaz contends that his claim is properly brought as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because he challenges the legality of his continued confinement itself, not merely the conditions in a particular facility. He argues that, due to the COVID\u201119 pandemic and his specific medical vulnerabilities (high blood pressure and morbid obesity), any continued incarceration in a DOCCS facility subjects him to a substantial risk of serious harm that constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Because, as alleged, no set of conditions in any DOCCS facility can adequately mitigate that risk, he maintains that the only constitutionally sufficient remedy is his release from custody, which places his claim at the 'core of habeas.'",
          "He emphasizes that as the master of his petition he has limited his request for relief to release from custody, rather than seeking changes to prison conditions or damages, and that this requested remedy confirms that the appropriate vehicle is habeas rather than a \u00a7 1983 civil rights action. He also invokes the principle that pro se pleadings must be liberally construed, arguing that the District Court should have read his petition as raising the strongest possible argument\u2014that his confinement in any DOCCS facility during the pandemic is unconstitutional\u2014rather than narrowly as a conditions claim specific to Sullivan.",
          "On the merits of his Eighth Amendment theory, Diaz maintains that his underlying health conditions significantly increase his risk of severe illness or death from COVID\u201119, and that DOCCS has no adequate plan to protect medically vulnerable inmates from infection given the inherently congregate and restrictive nature of prison environments. He asserts, in general terms, that effective social distancing and other mitigation measures are impossible in New York state prisons and that, as a result, his continued custody during the pandemic is inherently unsafe and unconstitutional.",
          "As to mootness, Diaz argues that his transfer from Sullivan to Sing Sing and the closure of Sullivan do not moot his claim because his petition challenges system\u2011wide DOCCS confinement during the COVID\u201119 pandemic, not only conditions at Sullivan. He contends that the relief he seeks\u2014release from DOCCS custody\u2014remains available despite the transfer, and that the case therefore presents a live controversy. He further notes that DOCCS transferred him without first seeking permission from the Court of Appeals under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 23(a), and he urges that such a transfer should not be allowed to defeat appellate jurisdiction or moot his claim. Alternatively, in some of his briefing he suggests that resolution of the habeas\u2011versus\u2011\u00a7 1983 question is important to provide guidance to similarly situated prisoners and that the Court should address that statutory question notwithstanding changes in his institutional placement."

According to the State, challenges to prison conditions\u2014including claims about medical care, exposure to communicable diseases, and facility\u2011specific practices\u2014must be brought, if at all, in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, not via federal habeas.

It asserts that Diaz\u2019s petition, properly understood, challenges conditions specific to Sullivan Correctional Facility 'under pandemic conditions.' Since Sullivan has been closed and Diaz transferred to another institution, the State argues that the Court of Appeals can no longer grant effective relief directed at those conditions or that facility. The State emphasizes that prison wardens do not control conditions at facilities they do not manage, and thus a writ directed to the former Sullivan superintendent would not provide Diaz any practical relief. It cites circuit precedent holding that an inmate\u2019s transfer from a facility generally moots claims for injunctive or declaratory relief against officials of the transferring facility.",
          "The State also previously moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the factual circumstances surrounding the COVID\u201119 pandemic had 'dramatically changed' since Diaz filed his petition, arguing that these changed conditions undermined the basis for his claim of ongoing unconstitutional risk. It maintains that Diaz has not alleged any specific facts about current conditions or COVID\u201119\u2011related risks at Sing Sing or at other DOCCS facilities, and therefore any system\u2011wide challenge is unsupported. In its view, Diaz\u2019s allegations are conclusory and speculative, lacking concrete factual detail or evidence regarding DOCCS\u2019s current policies, mitigation measures, or the actual risk posed to Diaz at his present facility.",
          "With respect to the sufficiency of the pleading, the State contends that Diaz\u2019s petition does not meet the requirements of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases because it offers only generalized assertions about prison environments and DOCCS\u2019s alleged inability to protect vulnerable inmates. The State argues that, even if such a theory could in principle support habeas relief, Diaz failed to allege specific facts demonstrating that no DOCCS facility can safely house him or that DOCCS officials are acting with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm. The State also raises federalism and statutory concerns, suggesting that allowing state prisoners to challenge conditions via habeas in this manner could circumvent limitations and remedial structures in the Prison Litigation Reform Act that apply to \u00a7 1983 conditions\u2011of\u2011confinement lawsuits."

That is best understood as a challenge to the legality of his custody itself, not merely to prison conditions at a particular facility. Especially given the obligation to construe his pro se petition liberally, the appellate court is likely to hold that such a claim is cognizable in habeas and that the district court erred in dismissing on the categorical ground that conditions\u2011of\u2011confinement claims can never proceed under \u00a7 2254 when the sole requested relief is release."

Under Eighth Amendment standards and pleading requirements (Dory and the \u00a7 2254 Rules), such broad, speculative allegations are insufficient to plausibly show that no constitutionally adequate confinement is possible and that release is the only remedy.

The transfer does not make it impossible to grant effective relief; the court can still order release if a violation is shown. The State\u2019s objection goes more to the sufficiency of Diaz\u2019s system\u2011wide allegations than to mootness. Although evolving pandemic conditions might undercut the merits, they do not eliminate the live controversy about the legality of his ongoing custody.

That legal question is reviewed de novo, and Supreme Court precedent leaves room for such claims. The appeal is not moot because Diaz remains in DOCCS custody and the court can still order the release he seeks; transfer and facility closure affect only facility\u2011specific injunctive claims, not a system\u2011wide challenge to the legality of custody itself. However, even with liberal construction of his pro se pleading, Diaz\u2019s habeas petition is thin and conclusory. It does not contain the specific factual allegations about DOCCS\u2019s actual COVID\u201119 measures, conditions at facilities, or deliberate indifference necessary to plausibly show that no DOCCS facility could constitutionally confine him and that release is required. Under \u00a7 2254 and the Eighth Amendment standards, the appellate court can affirm denial of the writ on that alternative ground while clarifying the availability of habeas for this narrow kind of claim. The resulting disposition is mixed: the court reverses the district court\u2019s reasoning on cognizability and mootness but ultimately affirms the denial of habeas relief because the petition fails on the merits or at the pleading stage, leaving the overall judgment (no habeas relief) intact but on different grounds."

      },
      "factual_background":"Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. is the largest dialysis services provider in the United States, treating nearly 190,000 patients annually in about 2,400 outpatient dialysis clinics. Chronic kidney disease involves progressive loss of kidney function; end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or stage 5 chronic kidney disease, requires dialysis or transplant. At the end of 2017, approximately 750,000 patients in the United States had ESRD. Many ESRD patients undergo regular dialysis, often three times per week at outpatient clinics, and may receive injectable medications during treatment.\n\nThe federal government finances a large portion of ESRD treatment through Medicare and Medicaid. All ESRD patients are eligible for Medicare, administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Medicare is the primary payer for more than 80% of ESRD patients' dialysis costs, with annual expenditures exceeding $40 billion. Medicare reimburses outpatient dialysis providers at a composite monthly rate per patient, covering dialysis treatments, certain laboratory tests, and drugs. Providers submit one monthly reimbursement claim per patient, which includes various data; CMS contractors process and pay these claims directly to ESRD treatment facilities. Dialysis facilities must also submit annual Medicare cost reports certifying compliance with applicable laws and regulations and reporting information such as medical directors\u2019 hours.\n\nMedicaid, jointly funded by federal and state governments and administered by states under federal oversight, pays costs for some ESRD patients who do not qualify for Medicare or for services not covered by Medicare. States submit forms to CMS seeking federal matching funds, including data arising from Medicaid claims. The federal government may later recoup any improperly paid funds by reducing future payments to the state.\n\nMartin Flanagan worked for Fresenius for about twenty-nine years, most recently as Director of Acute Market Development for its Western Business Unit. In that role, he negotiated contracts under which Fresenius provided dialysis to hospital inpatients and, according to his allegations, observed an extensive kickback scheme designed to induce referrals of ESRD patients to Fresenius outpatient clinics.\n\nAccording to the amended complaint, Flanagan alleges several categories of conduct by Fresenius intended to induce referrals:\n\n1. **Hospital contracts**: Beginning around 2007, Fresenius sought exclusive contracts with hospitals to provide inpatient dialysis care. Mid-level managers, including Flanagan, were instructed to obtain hospital contracts \"at any cost\" because such contracts were allegedly important for securing referrals of discharged inpatients to Fresenius outpatient clinics. To induce hospitals to contract, Fresenius allegedly accepted below-cost rates, limited fees that would otherwise be passed to hospitals, and declined to enforce certain cost-increasing provisions, thereby budgeting for and incurring losses on some contracts with larger hospitals. Internal messaging to marketing directors in 2009\u20132010 allegedly emphasized that losing a hospital contract meant losing referrals. When Flanagan raised concerns in 2010 that below-cost contracts appeared to be purchasing referrals, he was told not to complain and that such contracts reflected standard business practice. Flanagan alleges that other employees nationwide had similar experiences when raising concerns.\n\n2. **Medical director relationships**: Fresenius separately contracted with hospital nephrologists to serve as medical directors for its outpatient dialysis facilities, a role required by Medicare regulations, which call for a medical director to devote sufficient time to clinic oversight (with regulatory guidance suggesting roughly one-quarter of a standard 40-hour workweek). Flanagan alleges Fresenius targeted physicians who could refer large numbers of patients, compensated them at levels often more than double those paid by its primary competitor in the same localities, and informally tied compensation to the size and growth of the clinics' patient census. Fresenius allegedly reported medical directors as working 8\u201310 hours per week but did not require time records. Based on his observations, Flanagan alleges that medical directors in practice spent little or no time at the clinics and often only performed brief monthly document reviews requiring a signature. He also alleges Fresenius did not track the services performed. Medical director contracts contained non-compete, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement provisions; directors seeking to leave allegedly had to negotiate buyouts of the non-compete provisions.\n\n3. **Free or below-cost services to hospitals and physicians**: The amended complaint alleges that Fresenius provided various free or below-cost services to hospitals and physician practices, characterized as benefits intended to secure referrals. These include:\n   - The \"Bridge Program,\" which provided free services to hospitals, including a Fresenius employee to perform certain tasks and to channel ESRD patients to Fresenius outpatient clinics. The services allegedly had an annual value exceeding $10,000 per hospital.\n   - A \"Treatment Options Program,\" framed as an educational program for interested hospitals, physicians, and community organizations but also allegedly used to promote Fresenius outpatient services.\n   - \"Value added services\" or \"services beyond the rate\" for hospitals and patients, such as free nursing services, in-service training, transportation to and from dialysis treatments, and patient education.\n   - \"Practice management services\" offered to physician practices at free or below-cost rates, including specialty advisory services and technology solutions, and a free recruiting service for nephrology fellows and practicing physicians. Fresenius allegedly communicated to participating physicians that early referrals to Fresenius clinics could be profitable for their practices. Some physicians using these services entered into Confidentiality Agreements and Business Associate Agreements, pursuant to which Fresenius provided additional free resources.\n\n4. **Lease arrangements**: Fresenius allegedly entered into long-term, guaranteed leases at above\u2013fair-market rental rates for office space in physician-owned buildings, with terms sometimes extending 15 years and including annual escalators. Conversely, when leasing office space in buildings it owned to its medical directors, Fresenius allegedly provided below\u2013fair-market rental rates.\n\n5. **Joint venture agreements**: Starting in 2007, Fresenius began forming joint ventures with nephrologists and other physicians to co-own and co-manage outpatient dialysis facilities, giving partners a share of profits and losses. Fresenius allegedly expected and pressured joint-venture partners to refer patients to the jointly owned clinics, and the agreements included non-compete clauses that made it difficult for physicians to leave the ventures.\n\nFlanagan characterizes the above practices collectively as a fraudulent kickback scheme aimed at increasing referrals to Fresenius outpatient dialysis clinics and generating claims to federal healthcare programs.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In March 2014, Flanagan filed a sealed qui tam complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland under the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A) and (B). He alleged that Fresenius (1) knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to federal healthcare programs by operating an illegal kickback scheme, and (2) knowingly made or used false records or statements material to such false or fraudulent claims. The alleged predicate violations included offers or payments of remuneration to hospitals and physicians in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b), to induce referrals for services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid. The original complaint allegedly satisfied the FCA\u2019s filing requirements by being filed under seal and providing notice to the government.\n\nThe complaint remained sealed while the Department of Justice investigated and decided whether to intervene. In June 2020, the United States declined to intervene, and the complaint was unsealed. In January 2021, Fresenius moved to dismiss. In February 2021, in response, Flanagan filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint reasserted FCA claims under \u00a7\u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A) and (B) and added more than 100 pages of new factual allegations and additional schemes not described in the original complaint, including detailed allegations about joint ventures, free services, and other financial arrangements.\n\nIn the amended complaint, Flanagan alleged that Fresenius defrauded the government by: (a) knowingly offering remuneration to hospitals in the form of no-cost or below-cost items and services (including free discharge planners and other support) in connection with inpatient dialysis for ESRD patients, at least one purpose of which was allegedly to secure outpatient referrals to Fresenius clinics, in violation of the AKS and outside any safe harbor; and (b) knowingly offering remuneration to physicians, at least in part to reward or induce referrals to Fresenius outpatient clinics, including through medical director agreements allegedly above fair market value or commercially unreasonable, free patient education and practice management services, lease agreements alleged to be commercially unreasonable and not at fair market value, and joint-venture arrangements in outpatient dialysis clinics that were allegedly commercially unreasonable and not at fair market value.",
        "district_court_decision":"After transfer of venue, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts addressed several issues raised by Fresenius in a renewed motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b), 12(b)(1), and 12(b)(6).\n\nThe district court first examined FCA pre-suit filing requirements under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(2). It noted that the original complaint, which had been filed under seal and provided to the government, complied with those requirements. The amended complaint, however, added approximately 125 pages of allegations and multiple new claims, including those relating to joint ventures and provisions of free services to physicians and hospitals, but was not filed under seal and was not served on the government for a new intervention decision. The court concluded that the new claims in the amended complaint did not satisfy the FCA\u2019s mandatory filing prerequisites and dismissed them on that basis.\n\nAs an alternative basis as to the joint venture claims, the district court found they were also barred by the FCA\u2019s public-disclosure bar, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4), and the first-to-file rule, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b)(5). The court compared Flanagan\u2019s joint venture allegations to those in an earlier case, United States ex rel. CKD Project v. Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, which had been filed and unsealed prior to Flanagan\u2019s amended complaint. The court determined that the earlier complaint publicly disclosed substantially similar joint-venture allegations, that Flanagan\u2019s new allegations did not materially add to those public disclosures for purposes of the public-disclosure bar, and that the same alleged scheme had already been the subject of the prior action for purposes of the first-to-file rule. The court held these were additional grounds barring the new joint venture claims.\n\nIndependently, the district court addressed whether the amended complaint satisfied Rule 9(b)\u2019s heightened pleading standard for fraud. It found that, although the pleading was lengthy and detailed concerning the general operation of government reimbursement programs and Fresenius\u2019s alleged kickback scheme, it failed to include particularized allegations of specific false claims submitted for payment. With respect to Medicare claims, which Fresenius submitted directly to the federal government, the court observed that the amended complaint did not identify any specific false claim, nor did it provide representative or sample claims illustrating falsity and connection to the alleged schemes. The court also questioned whether the amended complaint sufficiently alleged causation between the alleged AKS violations and the submission of claims under the FCA\u2019s \"resulting from\" language, but it ultimately resolved the motion on Rule 9(b) grounds, determining that the complaint did not describe the false claims, or the alleged false records and statements, with the requisite specificity. The court therefore dismissed the remaining FCA claims for failure to satisfy Rule 9(b).\n\nIn January 2023, Flanagan moved for reconsideration and sought leave to file a second amended complaint. The district court denied both motions. Regarding leave to amend, the court noted the case\u2019s age (nearly nine years), the fact that Fresenius had filed three motions to dismiss challenging the lack of particularized false-claim allegations, and the absence of a timely corrective amendment. The court characterized the delay as extensive and found that allowing another amendment at that point would cause prejudice to Fresenius, citing both the length of the litigation and the repeated failure to cure identified deficiencies. On that basis, it denied the motion to amend.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Flanagan filed a timely notice of appeal challenging three district court orders: (1) the order granting Fresenius\u2019s motion to dismiss his amended complaint; (2) the order denying his motion for reconsideration; and (3) the order denying his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in dismissing his FCA claims under Rule 9(b) and related pleading standards and abused its discretion in denying leave to amend."

He maintains that the complaint adequately identified the types of claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid and the mechanisms by which allegedly tainted referrals resulted in dialysis treatments billed to federal programs, thereby meeting the particularity requirements for FCA claims.",
          "Regarding causation under the AKS \"resulting from\" theory, Flanagan initially argued that but-for causation was not required but, after this circuit\u2019s intervening decision in United States v. Regeneron Pharms., Inc., acknowledges that but-for causation is the governing standard. He contends, however, that the amended complaint meets this standard by alleging specific compensation relationships with particular physicians that were designed to and did, in fact, induce referrals, focusing in particular on allegations relating to one physician (Dr. Stephen Tilles), his roles as medical director, his compensation, and the volume of referrals attributed to him.",
          "On his false-record\/false-statement theory under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B), Flanagan asserts that the complaint alleges Fresenius\u2019s annual cost reports and certifications falsely represented compliance with the AKS and misstated medical directors\u2019 hours, and that Fresenius intended the government to rely on these documents as conditions of payment. He argues that such allegations are sufficient to state a claim without separately pleading but-for causation, because this subsection does not incorporate the \"resulting from\" language.",
          "As to the denial of leave to amend, Flanagan contends the district court abused its discretion by focusing on the age of the case rather than actual prejudice to Fresenius or the absence of justification for delay. He emphasizes that no discovery had taken place and no trial date had been set, so permitting amendment would not meaningfully prejudice Fresenius. He further argues that he only obtained critical claims data necessary to plead the false claims and causation elements after the district court granted the motion to dismiss, so he could not reasonably have made the proposed amendments earlier."

Fresenius contends that detailed descriptions of corporate practices and generalized assertions about how claims are typically submitted are not sufficient; the relator must plead representative claims or equivalent particularized facts linking the alleged kickbacks to actual claims for payment.",
          "On causation, Fresenius maintains that, under the AKS and this circuit\u2019s decision in Regeneron, Flanagan was required to plead facts showing that the alleged kickbacks were the but-for cause of specific claims.

It contends that generalized allegations of intent to bill federal programs for all treatments, combined with high-level descriptions of regulatory forms, do not meet Rule 9(b) standards.",
          "On the motion to amend, Fresenius argues that the district court acted within its discretion in denying leave due to undue delay and prejudice. Fresenius notes that the litigation had been pending for nearly nine years; that it had filed three motions to dismiss, each highlighting the absence of particularized false-claim allegations; and that Flanagan failed to cure these deficiencies despite having ample notice of them.

          "reasoning":"Under de novo review, the amended complaint must satisfy Rule 9(b) by pleading with particularity the existence of false or fraudulent claims (or false records\/statements) and, for AKS-based theories under \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(A), but-for causation between the kickbacks and those claims. The complaint, as described, is long and detailed about Fresenius\u2019s business practices and alleged kickback structures, but the district court found (and the appellee emphasizes) that it did not identify specific false claims or provide representative examples with the necessary who\/what\/when\/where\/how tying the schemes to actual Medicare\/Medicaid claims. Post\u2011Regeneron, this circuit requires but-for causation under the AKS \u201cresulting from\u201d language; the allegations about Dr. Tilles and others appear to show correlations (financial ties plus large referral volumes) rather than facts plausibly indicating that, absent the remuneration, specific claims would not have been submitted. That kind of inferential gap typically leads courts in FCA cases to affirm Rule 9(b) dismissals. \n\nFor the \u00a7 3729(a)(1)(B) false\u2011record\/false\u2011statement theory, the relator still must plead the particulars of the false statements and their materiality to payment. The summary indicates only generalized assertions that annual cost reports and certifications falsely represented AKS compliance and medical directors\u2019 hours, without specific identification of which reports, what precise misstatements they contained, and how those misstatements were material to any particular payment decision. Appellate courts regularly treat such generalized descriptions as inadequate under Rule 9(b). Given the complaint\u2019s failure to tie detailed scheme allegations to particular false claims or concretely described false records, and the circuit\u2019s relatively strict approach in FCA\/AKS pleading post\u2011Regeneron, the most likely result is that the appellate court agrees with the district court that Rule 9(b) is not satisfied and affirms dismissal on that ground without needing to disturb the district court\u2019s causation discussion."

Within this circuit, undue delay and repeated failure to fix identified problems are accepted grounds to deny leave, even apart from concrete trial-prejudice, and courts disfavor a wait\u2011and\u2011see strategy in which a plaintiff withholds stronger factual allegations until after losing on a motion to dismiss. Here, the court made an on\u2011the\u2011record, case\u2011specific assessment: it highlighted both the long pendency and the relator\u2019s history of not curing the same defect. That is well within the range of reasonable discretionary judgments.\n\nThe relator\u2019s argument that there was no real prejudice because there had been no discovery and no trial date, and that he obtained claims data only after dismissal, is unlikely to carry the day. Appellate courts typically require a concrete explanation of why critical information could not have been obtained earlier with diligence, and the record as summarized indicates the district court was not persuaded on that point. Given the deferential abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion standard and the presence of classic Rule 15(a) factors (undue delay; repeated failure to cure), the appellate court is likely to hold that the denial of leave to amend was within the district court\u2019s discretion and affirm."

On the Rule 9(b) question, the amended complaint is described as rich in \u2018scheme\u2019 detail but thin on specific tainted claims and on concrete, particularized false statements in cost reports and certifications. In this circuit, FCA complaints are frequently dismissed where they do not identify actual claims or provide representative examples, especially after an intervening decision (Regeneron) has clarified a stringent but\u2011for causation requirement for AKS\u2011based FCA theories. The appellant\u2019s reliance on broad descriptions of business practices, coupled with an emphasis on overall referral volumes and one exemplar physician, is unlikely to satisfy those standards on de novo review.\n\nOn the amendment issue, the record reflects nearly a decade of litigation, three dismissal motions highlighting the same core defect, and a district court that expressly grounded its denial in undue delay, repeated failure to cure, and prejudice from further extension. Under the abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion standard, and given this circuit\u2019s willingness to affirm denials of leave based on delay and repeated deficiencies alone, it is improbable that an appellate panel would find an abuse.

      "factual_background":"The case concerns the family-based immigrant visa process for Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Menezes, sponsored by his father, Eduardo Teles de Menezes.\n\nCarlos, a noncitizen, was admitted to the United States on a tourist visa on January 20, 2013. He lived with his father Eduardo in Massachusetts for several years, attended and graduated from high school there, and later studied at Target International Student Center on a student visa.\n\nOn December 9, 2017, Eduardo obtained lawful permanent resident (LPR) status. On January 12, 2018, when Carlos was 20 years old, Eduardo filed a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative (the \"Visa Petition\"), with USCIS to sponsor Carlos for an immigrant visa in the F2A category (children under 21 of LPRs). USCIS approved the petition on August 12, 2019, after approximately one year and seven months of processing. At the time of approval, a visa number in the F2A category was immediately available for Carlos.\n\nFollowing this approval and visa availability, Carlos submitted an immigrant visa application to the Department of State, and the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro scheduled him for an in-person immigrant visa interview on October 15, 2021.\n\nBefore that interview occurred, Eduardo naturalized as a U.S. citizen on May 27, 2021.\n\nCarlos attended the scheduled consular interview in October 2021. Several months later, on March 4, 2022, the Rio de Janeiro consulate sent Carlos an email (the \"March 4 Email\"). The email stated that, based on Eduardo's naturalization date, Carlos was \"not eligible for the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) since he was over 21 years old when the petitioner naturalized.\" The email further stated that Carlos's application was now classified in the F1 category (adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens) and that his visa category was \"not current.\" It explained that applicants then being called for interviews in the F1 category were those whose petitions were filed on or before December 1, 2014, whereas Carlos's petition had been filed on January 12, 2018.\n\nCarlos and Eduardo allege that, under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), Carlos remained a \"child\" (under 21 for statutory purposes) on the date of Eduardo's naturalization, despite his biological age having passed 21 during the process. They assert that, properly applying the CSPA age-calculation rules for F2A beneficiaries, Carlos's statutory age should have been treated as under 21 when Eduardo naturalized, so that the petition should have converted to the \"immediate relative\" category (children of U.S. citizens), which is not numerically capped and for which visas are always available. They contend that instead the government reclassified the petition into the F1 category, placing Carlos into a numerically capped queue with a much longer wait, thereby significantly delaying adjudication of his visa application.",

They challenged the Department of State's and consulate's treatment of Eduardo's approved I-130 petition and Carlos's visa classification following Eduardo's naturalization.\n\nThe complaint:\n- Identified as the relevant \"final agency action\" the reclassification of Eduardo's petition, as reflected in the March 4, 2022 consular email stating that Carlos was not CSPA-eligible and that his case was now in the F1 category and not current.\n- Alleged that this reclassification violated the Child Status Protection Act because, under the CSPA's age-calculation formula, Carlos should have been treated as under 21 on the date of Eduardo's naturalization and therefore should have been classified as an \"immediate relative\" of a U.S. citizen.\n- Asserted that the reclassification was contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (D).\n- Asserted a constitutional claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nAs relief, plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that Carlos is the \"immediate relative\" of his U.S.-citizen father entitled to classification in that category, or, in the alternative, an order requiring the government to reinstate Eduardo's petition in the F2A category.",

Plaintiffs opposed, arguing that their suit challenged only the erroneous reclassification of Eduardo's I-130 petition and not a visa denial, so consular nonreviewability did not apply, and further that the reclassification violated the CSPA's age-out protections.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that the doctrine of consular nonreviewability precluded review of the challenged action.

          "On consular nonreviewability: Plaintiffs argue that their case does not involve review of a consular officer's denial of an immigrant visa. They assert that Carlos has not received a final visa refusal; instead, the consulate has effectively suspended or delayed his visa adjudication by reclassifying the underlying approved petition into an F1 category that is not current. They characterize the challenged action as the Department of State's and consulate's misclassification of Eduardo's approved I-130 petition (as reflected in the March 4 Email), not an exercise of consular discretion to grant or deny a visa. They contend that challenges to petition classifications and to the authority to suspend visa processing fall outside the consular nonreviewability doctrine, citing cases such as Patel v. Reno and other \"delay\" cases, and that courts routinely review classification decisions like conversions among F-visa categories.",
          "On the CSPA\/statutory merits: Plaintiffs contend that, under the CSPA, Carlos remained a \"child\" for immigration purposes when Eduardo naturalized, even though his biological age had exceeded 21, because his statutory age under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(h)(1) was under 21 after subtracting the period during which the petition was pending. They argue that \u00a7 1151(f)(2)'s directive that age for conversion to the immediate-relative category be determined using the \"age of the alien on the date of the parent's naturalization\" refers to the statutory age as calculated under \u00a7 1153(h)(1) for F2A beneficiaries, not the biological age. They emphasize that \u00a7 1151(f)(2) applies only to petitions initially filed in the F2A category (for which \u00a7 1153(h)(1)'s special age formula applies), that the CSPA was enacted to prevent children from aging out due to government delay, and that interpreting \"age\" as biological age at naturalization would undermine that purpose and penalize children when parents naturalize. Plaintiffs point to statutory structure, including the treatment of F2B beneficiaries under \u00a7 1154(k), and legislative history indicating Congress intended to protect children of both LPRs and citizens from losing benefits because of bureaucratic processing delays or parental naturalization. They argue that, properly interpreted, Eduardo's petition should have converted to the immediate-relative category upon his naturalization, entitling Carlos to immediate visa availability, and that the reclassification to F1 was contrary to the CSPA and thus unlawful under the APA and violative of due process.",
          "On characterization of the March 4 Email: Plaintiffs argue that the March 4 Email does not purport to deny the visa but instead notifies Carlos that, because of his purported ineligibility for CSPA benefits and reassignment to the F1 category, his priority date is not yet current and he is not yet eligible for a final visa decision. They contend this supports their position that they challenge an ongoing classification decision and resultant delay, not a final visa refusal."

          "On consular nonreviewability: Defendants argue that, in substance, plaintiffs are challenging the consular officer's decision to refuse or effectively deny Carlos's immigrant visa, because the consulate informed him that he is not eligible for a visa in the immediate-relatives category, placed him in the F1 category, and stated that no visa is currently available. They characterize the March 4 Email as conveying a consular decision that Carlos is ineligible for CSPA protection and therefore not immediately eligible for a visa. On this view, the suit is an attempt to obtain review of a consular officer's visa determination and is barred by the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Alternatively, they maintain that even where limited review is possible, it is confined to asking whether the consular officer provided a facially legitimate and bona fide reason, which they assert was provided by the officer's reliance on the CSPA and the visa bulletin.",
          "On the CSPA\/statutory merits: Defendants argue that the term \"age\" in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151(f)(2) should be given its ordinary meaning, i.e., biological age, because the statute does not expressly redefine \"age\" in that subsection. They contend that \u00a7 1153(h)(1)'s special age-calculation formula applies only \"[f]or purposes of\" the F2A category (and another inapplicable category) and does not carry over to the immediate-relative context or to \u00a7 1151(f)(2). They emphasize that \u00a7 1151(f)(1) and \u00a7 1151(f)(2) both use the term \"age\" without redefining it, and assert that in \u00a7 1151(f)(1) the term clearly refers to biological age, so it should be interpreted similarly in \u00a7 1151(f)(2). They further argue that Congress did not intend the CSPA to fully eliminate aging out and that some beneficiaries, including those whose parents naturalize during the process, may still age out under the statute as written. They maintain that any adverse consequences result from preexisting numerical limits and category queues, not from the CSPA itself. Defendants also argue that interpreting \"age\" in \u00a7 1151(f)(2) to incorporate \u00a7 1153(h)(1)'s formula would improperly extend the \"for purposes of\" clause beyond its terms and create what they characterize as absurd results tied to the differing wait times in the visa categories across nationalities. They thus contend that Carlos, being biologically over 21 at the time of Eduardo's naturalization, could not qualify as an immediate relative under \u00a7 1151(f)(2), and that conversion to the F1 category was the correct application of the law."

Plaintiffs target the legal classification of an already-approved I\u2011130 and the agencies\u2019 reading of the CSPA, not a discretionary visa refusal. Courts distinguish review-barred visa denials from reviewable questions about petition adjudication, category conversions, and statutory eligibility. Here, the core dispute is the legal effect of Eduardo\u2019s naturalization on the petition and Carlos\u2019s status under the CSPA\u2014a statutory interpretation question about petition\/beneficiary classification. Treating such classification as categorically insulated from review would improperly extend consular nonreviewability beyond its traditional scope and leave no forum to correct alleged legal misapplication of the CSPA.

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"On the merits, the question is pure statutory interpretation of the CSPA and related INA provisions. Section 1151(f)(2) directs that when a petition initially filed in F2A converts upon a parent\u2019s naturalization, the relevant age is \"the age of the alien on the date of the parent\u2019s naturalization.\" By its terms and structure, \u00a7 1153(h)(1)\u2019s age-reduction formula applies \"[f]or purposes of\" the F2A and specified preference categories, not to immediate relatives or to \u00a7 1151(f). Congress knows how to cross-reference that formula when it wishes to; it did not do so in \u00a7 1151(f)(2). The most natural reading is that \"age\" there means biological age on the naturalization date. Plaintiffs\u2019 request to import the \u00a7 1153(h)(1) formula into \u00a7 1151(f)(2) conflicts with the limiting \"for purposes of\" clause and would treat age differently for converted-immediate-relative cases than for petitions originally filed as immediate relatives under \u00a7 1151(f)(1), even though Congress used the same term \"age\" in both subsections without redefinition. While plaintiffs\u2019 policy argument about protecting against aging out is substantial, the CSPA did not eliminate all aging out, and the statutory text does not clearly support their broader reading. Because Carlos was biologically over 21 when Eduardo naturalized, he could not qualify as an immediate relative under \u00a7 1151(f)(2); conversion to F1 was consistent with the statute. Thus, although review is available, the government\u2019s classification is not contrary to law under the APA, and the due process claim fails in the absence of a statutory entitlement."

Appellate courts are likely to treat that as reviewable under the APA. However, once the panel reaches the merits, the statutory text of \u00a7\u00a7 1151(f) and 1153(h) more strongly supports the government\u2019s plain-meaning reading of \"age\" in \u00a7 1151(f)(2) as biological age on the date of naturalization, given the limited scope of \u00a7 1153(h)(1), the parallel use of \"age\" in \u00a7 1151(f)(1) and (2), and Congress\u2019s decision not to extend the CSPA\u2019s age-freezing mechanism to the immediate-relative conversion context. The court is therefore likely to reverse the district court\u2019s threshold bar, hold that review is available, but ultimately rule against plaintiffs on the CSPA\/APA\/due process issues and affirm the government\u2019s classification decision, producing a mixed outcome overall."

      "factual_background":"Brian Flores is a professional football coach who has worked for multiple National Football League (NFL) member clubs, including the New England Patriots (2008\u20132018), Miami Dolphins (2019\u20132021), Pittsburgh Steelers (2022), and Minnesota Vikings (2023\u2013present). The NFL is an unincorporated association of 32 professional football clubs. Its structure, operations, and the relationships among the league, its member clubs, and club employees are governed by the NFL Constitution and Bylaws (the NFL Constitution). The NFL Constitution vests broad authority in the NFL Commissioner, including the power to interpret league rules and policies, discipline clubs and employees, hire counsel to respond to conduct deemed detrimental to the league or professional football, and exercise \u201cfull, complete, and final jurisdiction and authority to arbitrate\u201d specified categories of disputes, including disputes between coaches and member clubs.\n\nEach time Flores was hired by an NFL club, he signed an employment agreement that contained two relevant contractual features: (1) a club-specific arbitration clause requiring that disputes between Flores and that club be submitted to arbitration before the NFL Commissioner under the NFL\u2019s Dispute Resolution Procedural Guidelines, and (2) a provision in which Flores agreed to comply with and be bound by the NFL Constitution, which was incorporated by reference in its then-current form and as later amended.\n\nIn January 2019, while still employed by the New England Patriots under such an agreement, Flores interviewed for the head coach position with the Denver Broncos. He alleges that the Broncos failed to hire him because of his race and that the interview was a \u201csham\u201d conducted only to comply with the NFL\u2019s \u201cRooney Rule,\u201d which requires that clubs interview minority and\/or female candidates for open coaching positions. In February 2019, after the Broncos interview, Flores was hired as head coach of the Miami Dolphins.\n\nIn January 2022, after three seasons as head coach of the Dolphins, Flores was terminated. He then interviewed for head coach positions with the New York Giants and the Houston Texans. He was not selected for either job and alleges that these non-hires were the product of racial discrimination and retaliation. In February 2022, Flores was hired by the Pittsburgh Steelers as a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach. His Steelers employment agreement, like his prior club contracts, contained a club-specific arbitration clause and incorporated the NFL Constitution by reference.\n\nFlores, along with other coaches, alleges that the NFL and various member clubs engaged in systemic racial discrimination in hiring and retention decisions, including in connection with his head-coach interviews with the Broncos, Giants, and Texans and his termination by the Dolphins. His claims include alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and analogous state and local anti-discrimination statutes, brought on behalf of himself and a putative class of similarly situated individuals.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In February 2022, Flores filed a putative class action in the Southern District of New York against the NFL and several member clubs, including the Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Miami Dolphins, asserting claims of racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 and related state and local anti-discrimination laws. In April 2022, Flores filed a first amended complaint adding the Houston Texans as a defendant as to additional claims by Flores and adding Steve Wilks and Ray Horton as additional plaintiffs asserting similar race-discrimination claims against the Arizona Cardinals and Tennessee Titans, respectively. The operative complaint alleged race discrimination and related statutory violations in hiring, employment, and termination decisions, and sought to proceed on a class basis.\n\nIn June 2022, the NFL and the relevant member clubs moved to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and to stay the federal proceedings. They argued that all of the claims brought by Flores, Wilks, Horton, and the putative class were subject to arbitration under the arbitration provisions in the coaches\u2019 various employment agreements, each of which (a) contained a club-specific arbitration clause with the hiring club and (b) incorporated by reference the NFL Constitution\u2019s broader arbitration provision. Defendants further contended that the NFL itself, though not a signatory to the individual club contracts, could enforce those arbitration agreements under the doctrine of equitable estoppel because plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the NFL were intertwined with and derivative of their claims against the member clubs.\n\nOn March 1, 2023, the district court granted the motion to compel arbitration as to: (i) Flores\u2019s claims against the Miami Dolphins and his related claims against the NFL; (ii) Wilks\u2019s claims against the Arizona Cardinals and related claims against the NFL; and (iii) Horton\u2019s claims against the Tennessee Titans and related claims against the NFL. The court relied on the club-specific arbitration clauses and the incorporation of the NFL Constitution in those employment agreements, as well as equitable estoppel to reach claims against the NFL. The district court, however, denied the motion to compel arbitration as to Flores\u2019s claims against the Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Houston Texans, and his related claims against the NFL.\n\nRegarding Flores\u2019s claims against the Broncos and related claims against the NFL, the district court concluded that they fell outside the Patriots-specific arbitration clause but within the general arbitration provision of the NFL Constitution that had been incorporated into Flores\u2019s Patriots contract. The court nevertheless refused to enforce the NFL Constitution\u2019s arbitration clause, holding under Massachusetts law that it was illusory and unenforceable because the NFL and its member clubs retained unilateral power to modify the terms of the NFL Constitution. The court therefore ordered that Flores\u2019s claims against the Broncos and the related NFL claims proceed in federal court.\n\nAs to Flores\u2019s claims against the Giants and Texans and his related claims against the NFL, defendants argued that Flores\u2019s later Steelers contract, with its own club-specific arbitration clause and incorporation of the NFL Constitution, required arbitration and applied retroactively to his claims arising from the Giants and Texans interviews that pre-dated his Steelers employment. Without resolving the retroactivity question, the district court held that defendants had not demonstrated the existence of a valid arbitration agreement covering those claims because the version of the Flores\u2013Steelers agreement submitted to the court lacked the NFL Commissioner\u2019s signature, which under the contract\u2019s terms was required. On that basis, the court denied the motion to compel arbitration of Flores\u2019s claims against the Giants, Texans, and related claims against the NFL.\n\nIn March 2023, both sides filed cross-motions for partial reconsideration of the March 1, 2023 order. Defendants argued that they had not been given notice that the absence of the Commissioner\u2019s signature on the Steelers agreement would be a determinative ground for denying arbitration, and they submitted a later copy of the Flores\u2013Steelers agreement bearing the Commissioner\u2019s June 17, 2022 approval signature. On July 25, 2023, the district court denied both motions for reconsideration.\n\nOn August 21, 2023, the NFL, Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Houston Texans filed a notice of appeal limited to the portions of the March 1, 2023 order declining to compel arbitration of Flores\u2019s claims against the Broncos, Giants, and Texans and his related claims against the NFL, and to the July 25, 2023 order denying their motion for reconsideration. Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal challenging the portions of the March 1 order compelling arbitration of Flores\u2019s claims against the Dolphins and Wilks\u2019s and Horton\u2019s claims; the Second Circuit subsequently dismissed that cross-appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.

          "Flores\u2019s Patriots employment agreement incorporated by reference the NFL Constitution, which in Section 8.3 grants the Commissioner \u2018full, complete, and final jurisdiction and authority to arbitrate\u2019 any dispute between a coach and any member club. Because Flores interviewed with the Broncos while under contract with the Patriots, his discrimination claims against the Broncos and the related claims against the NFL fall squarely within that arbitration provision and must be arbitrated.",
          "The NFL Constitution\u2019s arbitration clause is a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement protected by the FAA. Its grant of broad authority to the Commissioner does not render it illusory or non-arbitral; rather, it reflects the parties\u2019 contractual choice of an arbitral decision-maker and procedures within the range permitted by the FAA and consistent with longstanding league practice.",
          "Under equitable estoppel, Flores is bound to arbitrate his claims against the NFL itself because those claims are factually intertwined with and derivative of his claims against the member clubs (Broncos, Giants, Texans). Having relied on the NFL Constitution and club relationships to assert joint wrongdoing by the NFL and its clubs, he cannot simultaneously avoid the arbitration obligations embedded in those same instruments.",
          "As to the Giants and Texans, Flores\u2019s employment agreement with the Steelers also contains a valid arbitration clause and incorporates the same NFL Constitution provision. That agreement, once properly executed, binds Flores to arbitrate his claims, and its scope is broad enough to encompass disputes arising out of prior hiring processes with other clubs, so his Giants and Texans claims and related NFL claims are arbitrable under the Steelers agreement.",
          "The district court\u2019s refusal to compel arbitration based on the absence of the Commissioner\u2019s signature on the version of the Steelers agreement in the record was improper because defendants were not given notice that this perceived defect would be dispositive and were deprived of an opportunity to cure it. Once defendants produced a fully executed version of the contract on reconsideration, the court should have recognized a valid arbitration agreement and compelled arbitration of the Giants and Texans claims.",
          "Even if the NFL Commissioner subsequently designated another individual (Peter C. Harvey) to serve as arbitrator in Flores\u2019s case, this designation was consistent with the authority granted by the NFL Constitution and any applicable dispute resolution guidelines, and does not undermine the validity or enforceability of Flores\u2019s arbitration agreement."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "Flores\u2019s discrimination claims against the Broncos, Giants, Texans, and the NFL are not subject to any enforceable arbitration agreement because the provisions on which defendants rely either fall outside the scope of valid club-specific agreements or are themselves invalid and unenforceable. In particular, Flores\u2019s Patriots club-specific arbitration clause covers only disputes with the Patriots, not claims involving other clubs like the Broncos or the NFL itself.",
          "The NFL Constitution\u2019s general arbitration provision, as incorporated into Flores\u2019s Patriots contract, is unconscionable and illusory under applicable state law because the NFL and its member clubs retain unilateral authority to amend the Constitution, including its arbitration terms, at any time. This unilateral modification power deprives the provision of mutuality and enforceable contractual obligation.",
          "Even apart from state contract law, the NFL Constitution\u2019s arbitration clause does not qualify as a protected arbitration agreement under the FAA. It does not provide for an independent, neutral arbitral forum or definite procedures but instead vests unilateral substantive and procedural control over the dispute in the NFL Commissioner, who is the principal executive of one of the adverse parties and is paid by the member clubs. This structure is inconsistent with the \u2018traditional arbitral practice\u2019 and \u2018bilateral arbitration\u2019 contemplated by the FAA.",
          "The arbitration scheme at issue effectively prevents Flores from vindicating his federal statutory rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. By requiring him to submit employment discrimination claims to the unilateral authority of the league\u2019s chief executive\u2014who oversees and owes duties to the very entities he is suing\u2014the provision operates as a prospective waiver of his right to pursue statutory remedies in a genuinely neutral adjudicatory forum and therefore is unenforceable under the effective vindication doctrine.",
          "With respect to the Giants and Texans claims, defendants failed to carry their burden of demonstrating the existence of a valid arbitration agreement at the time of the initial motion, because the version of the Flores\u2013Steelers agreement they presented was not signed by the Commissioner, despite contractual language requiring such approval. The district court properly concluded that, on that record, no valid arbitration agreement binding Flores to arbitrate the Giants and Texans disputes had been shown.",
          "Defendants\u2019 later submission, on reconsideration, of a version of the Steelers agreement bearing the Commissioner\u2019s signature does not warrant reconsideration because it was evidence that could have been presented earlier with reasonable diligence. Moreover, even if the Steelers agreement were deemed valid and retroactive, it incorporates the same NFL Constitution arbitration provision that Flores contends is invalid and unenforceable, so it cannot provide a basis to compel arbitration of his Giants and Texans claims or related claims against the NFL."

          "reasoning":"Whether the NFL Constitution\u2019s arbitration provision, incorporated into Flores\u2019s Patriots contract, is enforceable against his Broncos-related claims is a legal question of contract enforceability under the FAA and Massachusetts law, reviewed de novo. The district court found the provision illusory because the league and clubs can unilaterally amend the NFL Constitution. Appellate courts, however, have frequently upheld arbitration clauses in league constitutions and handbooks that are incorporated by reference, even where the drafter retains amendment power, so long as the promise to arbitrate is currently operative and there is some baseline mutual obligation. Here, Flores admittedly assented to be bound by the Constitution \u201cas amended,\u201d and Section 8.3 specifically commits coach\u2013club disputes to the Commissioner\u2019s arbitration. There is no indication that the NFL purported to retroactively alter the arbitration obligation so as to nullify its promise. In similar contexts, unilateral modification rights have not rendered arbitration clauses illusory where existing disputes remain covered unless and until changed with notice. Given the strong federal policy favoring arbitration under the FAA and the district court\u2019s outlier conclusion that the Constitution\u2019s clause is categorically illusory, the appellate court is likely to hold that the NFL Constitution\u2019s arbitration clause, as incorporated into the Patriots agreement, is a valid agreement to arbitrate Flores\u2019s dispute with the Broncos and related claims against the NFL. Accordingly, the refusal to compel arbitration of the Broncos claims on illusoriness grounds is reversed."

          "reasoning":"Whether the NFL Constitution\u2019s procedure qualifies as \u201carbitration\u201d under the FAA and whether it violates the effective-vindication doctrine are questions of law, reviewed de novo. The district court reasoned that vesting \u2018full, complete, and final\u2019 authority in the Commissioner\u2014who is closely aligned with the clubs\u2014meant the process was not true arbitration and\/or prevented effective vindication of \u00a7 1981 rights. Federal courts, including the Second Circuit, have repeatedly enforced arbitration clauses naming a party-affiliated or employer-selected decisionmaker so long as the basic hallmarks of arbitration (a designated decisionmaker, the opportunity to present evidence, and a binding decision) are present. The FAA does not require a neutral chosen in the abstract; it allows parties to contract for arbitral fora with structural ties to one side, leaving partiality challenges to vacatur standards after the award. Nor does the effective-vindication doctrine bar agreements simply because the arbitrator is not structurally independent; that doctrine is reserved for provisions that foreclose statutory remedies (e.g., outright class-action waivers in certain contexts, bans on particular forms of relief, prohibitive fees), which are not alleged here. The NFL procedure specifies a forum (the Commissioner or his designee), identifies a decisionmaker, and produces a binding award; this fits the FAA\u2019s conception of arbitration, even if it is highly one-sided in appearance. Precedent strongly disfavors invalidating arbitration agreements based solely on the decisionmaker\u2019s institutional relationship to a party. The appellate court is therefore likely to reverse the district court\u2019s alternative holding that the clause is non-arbitral or violates effective vindication and hold that the agreement is enforceable under the FAA."

          "prediction":"REVERSE",
          "reasoning":"The existence and scope of an arbitration agreement, including whether the Steelers contract is valid and covers pre-existing disputes, are reviewed de novo. The district court denied arbitration of the Giants and Texans claims because the version of the Steelers agreement first submitted lacked the Commissioner\u2019s required approval signature. On that record, the court held there was no valid agreement. On appeal, however, the record now includes a later copy of the same Steelers contract signed by the Commissioner on June 17, 2022. The contract language and the NFL\u2019s internal approval requirement strongly suggest that the parties (Flores and the Steelers) intended to be bound as of execution, with league approval functioning as an internal condition or ratification step rather than as a condition that left Flores free of all contractual obligations\u2014including his compensation and job duties\u2014until the Commissioner signed. Courts are generally reluctant to treat such approval clauses as eliminating contract formation entirely when the parties have performed under the agreement, as Flores did with the Steelers. Furthermore, the NFL and the clubs have plausibly argued that the Steelers arbitration clause is broad enough to cover disputes between Flores and other member clubs, and that such clauses can apply retroactively to earlier disputes so long as the parties so agree in clear language; here, the language is sweeping and tied to the employment relationship and the NFL Constitution rather than limited solely to disputes with the Steelers. Given the strong presumption in favor of arbitrability, the appellate court is likely to conclude there is a valid and enforceable Steelers arbitration agreement, that the league\u2019s initial failure to include a signed copy did not negate the contract, and that the clause encompasses Flores\u2019s Giants and Texans hiring claims and related claims against the NFL. The district court\u2019s refusal to compel arbitration of these claims is therefore reversed."

          "reasoning":"Denial of reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretion. The district court refused to reconsider even after defendants produced a fully executed Steelers agreement bearing the Commissioner\u2019s signature. Local standards require newly discovered evidence that could not with reasonable diligence have been presented earlier, an intervening change in law, or clear error\/manifest injustice. The district court emphasized that the signature-page evidence was available all along. However, the order denying arbitration on the specific ground of the missing Commissioner\u2019s signature came as a sua sponte rationale\u2014defendants were not put on notice that the lack of that signature would be dispositive or should be specifically addressed or supplemented in the initial submissions. In such circumstances, later submission of a fully signed agreement corrects a record deficiency created by the court\u2019s unannounced focus, and refusing to consider it effectively elevates a curable technical omission over the parties\u2019 actual contractual intent and performance. Given that the core purpose of reconsideration is to prevent clear error or manifest injustice, and the new evidence goes to the existence of the very arbitration agreement at issue, the appellate court is likely to find that the district court abused its discretion in declining to consider the signed Steelers agreement and in allowing litigation to proceed in the face of a clearly executed arbitration contract. Accordingly, the denial of reconsideration is reversed, with instructions to compel arbitration of the Giants and Texans claims as well."

      "overall_outcome":"REVERSE",
      "confidence":0.7,
      "reasoning":"All issues on appeal center on the enforceability of the NFL Constitution\u2019s arbitration clause and its incorporation into Flores\u2019s Patriots and Steelers contracts. Modern FAA jurisprudence in the Second Circuit and elsewhere strongly favors enforcement of such agreements, including in professional sports settings, even when the league commissioner serves as arbitrator. Arguments that the clause is illusory or non-arbitral because the NFL can amend the Constitution or because the Commissioner is not structurally neutral are in substantial tension with precedent upholding employer-drafted arbitration policies, internal approval requirements, and employer- or union-affiliated arbitrators. Likewise, courts typically do not treat an internal approval signature as negating the existence of a contract when both sides have fully performed; instead, they look to intent and conduct, both of which support the existence of a binding Steelers agreement. The combination of a strong federal policy favoring arbitration, the breadth of the clauses at issue, and the disfavor toward using effective-vindication doctrine or structural bias arguments to invalidate arbitration agreements makes it unlikely that the appellate court will sustain the district court\u2019s refusals to compel arbitration. The most coherent appellate resolution, and the one consistent with the subsequent dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal, is to reverse the challenged portions of the order and require Flores to arbitrate his Broncos, Giants, and Texans claims and the associated claims against the NFL under the NFL Constitution, while leaving intact the unappealed orders compelling arbitration of his Dolphins claims and the other coaches\u2019 claims."

      },
      "factual_background":"The Rhode Island Interscholastic League (the League) is a nonprofit association of more than seventy public, private, and parochial high schools in Rhode Island that voluntarily join to participate in interscholastic athletics. The League's mission is to supervise and administer athletic programs, contests, and schedules, and to provide governance and leadership for high school sports programs. It seeks to ensure fair play, honorable competition, good sportsmanship, ethical conduct, and, in particular, to \"promote even competition and maximum participation\" across Rhode Island high school sports.\n\nMember schools rely on the League to set minimum, uniform eligibility standards for student-athletes. These standards are intended to ensure fundamentally fair and equitable competition and harmonious relations among competing schools. The League's eligibility rules require, among other things, that a student play for the school in which he or she is enrolled (with limited exceptions), be in or beyond the ninth grade, be under nineteen years old as of September 1 of the relevant academic year, maintain passing grades in at least sixty percent of his or her coursework, and obtain a pre-participation athletic physical.\n\nAt issue here is the League's Eight-Semester Rule. That rule provides that once a student enters the ninth grade, the student is limited to eight consecutive semesters of eligibility and automatically becomes ineligible for athletic competition four years from the date of entry into the ninth grade. The League has a waiver process characterized in its rules as \"exceptional and extraordinary relief.\" Initially, the League's Executive Director decides waiver requests. A negative decision may be appealed to the Waiver Request Hearing Committee (Waiver Committee), composed of four high school administrators and the Chairperson of the League's Principals' Committee on Athletics (Principals' Committee). A majority vote of Committee members present is required to decide an appeal. Decisions of the Waiver Committee may, in turn, be appealed to the Principals' Committee, which may, in extenuating circumstances causing undue hardship, waive an eligibility rule upon approval by sixty percent of the members present and voting.\n\nJohn Doe has been active in competitive sports since elementary school, playing basketball from the second grade, adding baseball by third or fourth grade, and later playing both sports in middle school. In seventh and eighth grades he also played flag football. He entered a Rhode Island parochial high school, a League member school, as a freshman in fall 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that school did not offer sports in fall 2020, which John and his parents experienced as a loss of camaraderie and connection. As pandemic conditions improved, John played abbreviated seasons of basketball, football, and track later that academic year. Academically, he did well at the parochial school, averaging 89%, though his teachers identified areas for improvement and he began working with a tutor.\n\nFor the 2021\u20132022 academic year, John's parents transferred him to an out-of-state boarding school to obtain more community, personalized attention, structure, independence, and in-person learning. Following advice from a boarding-school consultant, they enrolled him there as a freshman, effectively reclassifying him and causing him to repeat ninth grade so he could have a full four-year experience at the boarding school with added maturity and preparation for its rigor. During that repeated freshman year, he played football in the fall, basketball in the winter, and lacrosse in the spring.\n\nAlthough he finished the 2021\u20132022 year at the boarding school with strong grades overall (including multiple \"honors with commendation\" and \"high pass\" grades), John and his father reported that he struggled socially and academically, earned lower grades than at the parochial school, lost significant weight, and began exhibiting symptoms of a depressive disorder. In summer 2022 he was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and several learning disorders. His parents then decided to transfer him back to Rhode Island, enrolling him at a different private school than the one he first attended. Because he had now completed a freshman year twice, he entered the 2022\u20132023 academic year as a sophomore. At the new private school he received an Individual Support Plan (ISP) and other academic accommodations, such as extended time on standardized tests. His well-being improved, and he played varsity football in the fall and varsity basketball in the winter.\n\nDuring conversations with the private school's athletic director in summer 2022, John's parents learned of the Eight-Semester Rule and how it would apply to John. Because John first entered ninth grade at the parochial school in fall 2020, he would complete eight consecutive semesters by the end of spring 2024, the close of his junior year at the new private school. As a result, under the League's Rule, he would be ineligible to play sports at any League member school in what would be his fifth year of high school, the 2024\u20132025 school year, which for him would be his senior year at the private school.\n\nIn March 2023, John's parents, through counsel, formally requested a waiver of the Eight-Semester Rule from the League to allow him to participate in interscholastic sports during the 2024\u20132025 academic year. They characterized the request as one for a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), asserting that John's disabilities were the sole reason for the waiver request and that, absent the (then-undiagnosed) learning disabilities, he would have remained at the original Rhode Island school and would not have needed a waiver. They submitted written statements from John and his parents, a letter from his tutor, a psychoeducational evaluation, report cards from his three high schools, and transfer application materials.\n\nThe Waiver Committee held a hearing in April 2023. It heard testimony from John, his parents, their attorney, and the private school's athletic director. The Committee also reviewed the written submissions, including medical records, the ISP, and letters from John's psychiatrist and the private school's Director of Wellness. The Committee unanimously denied the waiver, concluding that the documentation and testimony did not establish an academic or athletic hardship warranting waiver of the Eight-Semester Rule.\n\nJohn appealed to the Principals' Committee. At an August 2023 hearing, the same individuals testified, and the same materials were submitted along with an additional psychiatrist letter, a letter from John's primary care physician, and documentation of his standardized testing accommodations. In September 2023, the Principals' Committee unanimously affirmed the denial, again finding that the materials did not show an academic or athletic hardship sufficient to support a waiver of the Rule.",

        "claims_brought":"In October 2023, John Doe, through his parents James and Jane Doe, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the Rhode Island Interscholastic League. The complaint alleged that the League's refusal to grant a waiver of the Eight-Semester Rule violated Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, claiming that the requested waiver constituted a reasonable accommodation for John\u2019s disabilities. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and an injunction preventing the League from enforcing the Eight-Semester Rule against John.",
        "district_court_decision":"After a brief discovery period and written submissions, the district court held a hearing in April 2024 on the plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief. Shortly thereafter, the court issued an order granting a permanent injunction permitting John to participate in competitive sports during the 2024\u20132025 academic year notwithstanding the Eight-Semester Rule. In doing so, the court analyzed the four factors for permanent injunctive relief\u2014actual success on the merits, irreparable harm, balance of equities, and public interest\u2014and found they weighed in favor of the plaintiffs. On the merits, the district court addressed disputed elements of the ADA claim: whether Title II applied to the League; whether the denial of the waiver was caused by John\u2019s disability; and whether the requested waiver was a reasonable accommodation. The court concluded that the League was a public entity subject to Title II; that John\u2019s disability was the but-for cause of the denial because, absent his anxiety, depression, ADHD, and related impairments, he would have remained at the boarding school and played through his senior year; and that waiving the Eight-Semester Rule in his case was a reasonable accommodation under both Title II and Title III.",

It argues that his ineligibility stems from his voluntary reclassification as a freshman at the out-of-state boarding school, which resulted in his senior year falling in his fifth year of high school. According to the League, the decision to repeat ninth grade was unrelated to his disability, and therefore his disability was not the but-for cause of his having exhausted eight semesters of eligibility.",
          "The League points out that John's strong academic performance at the parochial school and the reasons given for his transfer to the boarding school\u2014pandemic-related disruptions, remote learning, and desire for more community and structure\u2014show that the initial transfer and reclassification were not driven by disability. It maintains that because his ineligibility was effectively fixed when he chose to repeat the ninth grade, subsequent disability-related circumstances, including the later transfer back to Rhode Island, did not cause his eventual ineligibility under the Rule.",
          "The League argues that the Eight-Semester Rule is an essential component of its interscholastic athletics program, designed to promote maximum participation and competitive balance by ensuring that all students have the same number of semesters of eligibility. It asserts that allowing a student to compete in a ninth or tenth semester, after already having the opportunity to play during eight semesters, would undermine these core purposes by injecting more experienced and often older players into competition, potentially displacing younger, less mature students and altering the competitive landscape.",
          "The League further maintains that the Rule operates in tandem with age-based restrictions that courts have widely recognized as essential aspects of interscholastic athletics. It emphasizes that in all thirty-four prior waivers granted over the past decade, the League has never permitted a student to exceed eight semesters of actual playing eligibility; instead, waivers were granted only where students could not participate during some of their first eight semesters due to extreme circumstances (such as homelessness or severe trauma), so those students did not gain extra seasons of competitive advantage.",
          "The League contends that granting John's requested waiver would represent a fundamental alteration of the nature of its athletics program by disrupting uniform eligibility, competitive parity, and the goal of maximizing participation. It also argues that the district court misapplied the fundamental-alteration analysis by focusing too narrowly on individual sports rather than on the League's overall educational and competitive objectives, and by discounting the risks of displacement, safety concerns due to size and maturity differences, and the potential for \"red-shirting.\"",
          "Finally, the League argues that because John cannot satisfy the merits of his ADA claim\u2014both on causation and on the reasonableness of the requested accommodation\u2014the plaintiffs did not meet the \"actual success on the merits\" requirement necessary for a permanent injunction, and thus the injunctive relief should not have been granted."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "The plaintiffs assert that John Doe is a qualified individual with disabilities under the ADA and that the League's denial of a waiver for the Eight-Semester Rule denied him access to the benefits of interscholastic athletics on the basis of his disabilities. They argue that the waiver he requested is a reasonable accommodation necessary to afford him equal access to competitive sports during his senior year.",
          "On causation, the plaintiffs contend that John's disabilities were the but-for cause of the sequence of events that led to his ineligibility. They argue that although his initial transfer and reclassification may not have been due to disability, his later diagnoses of anxiety, depression, ADHD, and learning disorders caused his parents to transfer him back to Rhode Island. They maintain that but for his disabilities, he would have remained at the boarding school and would have been able to play sports through his senior year there without running afoul of the League\u2019s Eight-Semester Rule.",
          "The plaintiffs emphasize that his disabilities necessitated the move back to Rhode Island and the accommodations he now receives, and that this disability-driven transfer brought him back under the League's jurisdiction, where the Eight-Semester Rule then prevented him from playing in his senior year. In their view, this creates the requisite causal connection between his disabilities and the League\u2019s denial of the waiver.",
          "Regarding the reasonableness of the accommodation, the plaintiffs argue that waiving the Eight-Semester Rule in John\u2019s specific circumstances does not alter an essential aspect of interscholastic competition and instead simply allows him to access the same opportunity to play sports during his senior year that nondisabled students ordinarily enjoy. They characterize the Rule as not essential to the nature of high school sports but rather as an administrative eligibility provision that can be modified without undermining the fundamental character of the games themselves.",
          "They further argue that permitting John to play in his senior year would not unfairly advantage him or materially disadvantage other players, particularly given that he meets all other eligibility criteria, including age limits, and has already been competing alongside his peers. They contend that a one-student, one-year waiver is a tailored, individualized modification that does not destabilize competitive balance or safety and is consistent with the League's stated goals of fair play and maximizing participation.",
          "The plaintiffs rely on case law they read as supporting the view that disability-caused academic or enrollment disruptions can justify waivers of maximum-participation rules as reasonable accommodations, and they urge that the ADA's reasonable-modification duty requires flexibility from athletic associations when strict enforcement of eligibility rules would, in practice, exclude disabled students from full participation in educational opportunities."

          "reasoning":"Causation under Titles II and III is a legal question reviewed de novo. The record shows that John\u2019s fifth year of high school (and resulting ineligibility) was fixed when his parents, for non-disability reasons, chose to reclassify him as a freshman at the boarding school. At that point, under the League\u2019s facially neutral Eight\u2011Semester Rule, his senior year necessarily fell outside the eight\u2011semester window. His later diagnoses and disability\u2011related transfer back to Rhode Island did not cause the exhaustion of his eight semesters; they only affected where, not whether, he would confront the Rule. Under but\u2011for causation, the relevant question is whether, absent the disability, he would have been ineligible under the Rule. Even if he had remained at the boarding school, he still would have completed eight consecutive semesters by the end of what is now his junior year; the League\u2019s Rule would apply in the same way to any student who repeated ninth grade for non\u2011disability reasons. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the disability was the but\u2011for cause of his ineligibility therefore misapplies the causation standard: the operative cause is the earlier, voluntary reclassification decision, not the subsequent disability\u2011driven transfer back to a League member school."

          "prediction":"REVERSE",
          "reasoning":"Whether a requested modification is a reasonable accommodation or a fundamental alteration is a mixed question of law and fact; in this context\u2014on a paper record after an injunction hearing\u2014the core determination is treated as a legal one and reviewed de novo. The Eight\u2011Semester Rule is an eligibility rule designed to further core program objectives: maximum participation, competitive balance, uniformity, and alignment with age\u2011based limits. The League\u2019s undisputed history shows that it has never allowed any student to obtain more than eight actual semesters of competition; past waivers merely allowed students who lost seasons due to extreme hardship to use all eight semesters, not to gain a ninth. Granting John a ninth semester would thus be a qualitatively different step: he has already had the opportunity to compete in all eight semesters, including a full athletic year during his repeated ninth grade at the boarding school. Allowing him a fifth year of eligibility would place an older, more experienced player into competition and risk displacement of younger athletes, while eroding the uniformity and predictability of the Rule and opening the door to red\u2011shirting pressures that the League reasonably seeks to avoid. Under Martin, this sort of modification alters an essential eligibility condition that defines the character of the competition as a four\u2011year high\u2011school program with equal participation windows. Because the League bears the burden but presented a coherent, program\u2011wide rationale\u2014which the plaintiffs did not meaningfully undermine\u2014the requested waiver would constitute a fundamental alteration and therefore is not a reasonable accommodation as a matter of law. The district court\u2019s contrary conclusion is reversible legal error."

Because the plaintiffs failed, as a matter of law, to prove (1) that John\u2019s disability was the but\u2011for cause of his ineligibility under the Eight\u2011Semester Rule, and (2) that the requested ninth\u2011semester waiver was a reasonable accommodation that would not fundamentally alter the League\u2019s program, they did not achieve actual success on the merits. Without success on the merits, one of the four required elements for a permanent injunction is absent, so the injunction cannot stand regardless of the district court\u2019s findings on irreparable harm, balance of equities, or public interest. In relying on an incorrect understanding of causation and of the fundamental\u2011alteration limitation, the district court necessarily abused its discretion in granting permanent injunctive relief."

      "reasoning":"The appeal is focused solely on the first element of permanent injunctive relief\u2014actual success on the merits of the ADA reasonable\u2011accommodation claim. On de novo review, the League\u2019s arguments on causation and fundamental alteration are stronger under prevailing ADA doctrines. The chain of events shows that John\u2019s ineligibility under the Eight\u2011Semester Rule was locked in by his family\u2019s earlier, non\u2011disability\u2011motivated choice to repeat ninth grade at the boarding school. The later disability\u2011driven transfer back to Rhode Island did not change the fact that he had already used or had the opportunity to use eight semesters of eligibility; it merely relocated where his final years would be spent. That breaks the but\u2011for link required by Titles II and III between the disability and the exclusion. Separately, the record reflects that the Eight\u2011Semester Rule functions as a core eligibility limit tied to age, competitive balance, and maximum participation, and that the League has consistently refused to give athletes more than eight semesters of actual competition. Permitting a ninth semester for a student who already played through eight semesters would undermine that design, risk displacement of younger players, and invite strategic red\u2011shirting. Under the Martin framework, such a modification would fundamentally alter the nature of the League\u2019s interscholastic program. Because those two legal errors undercut the district court\u2019s finding of actual success on the ADA claim, the permanent injunction must be reversed, and no remand for further fact\u2011finding is necessary on the limited issues presented on appeal."

      "factual_background":"On July 17, 2014, Quinn Lucas Schansman, a dual citizen of the United States and the Netherlands, boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur to meet his family for a vacation in Indonesia. While traveling over eastern Ukraine, MH17 was shot down by a surface\u2011to\u2011air missile launched from territory forcibly controlled by the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DPR), which the complaint describes as a terrorist group backed by the Russian Federation. All passengers on board, including Quinn, died.\n\nThe DPR had been designated a terrorist organization by Ukraine as of July 17, 2014, and the United States had imposed sanctions on it, although the DPR had not been designated by the United States as a \"foreign terrorist organization\" under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1189(a)(1). The U.S. Department of the Treasury had issued sanctions regulations relating to the situation in Ukraine.\n\nSberbank is headquartered in the Russian Federation and operates worldwide. During the time period relevant to the second amended complaint, Sberbank maintained branches in the United States and held correspondent accounts with banks in New York City. These correspondent accounts were used to effectuate U.S.\u2011dollar transactions, and Sberbank advertised these correspondent relationships on its website.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that Sberbank provided banking and money\u2011transfer services to the DPR and DPR\u2011affiliated fundraising entities, and that Sberbank did so with actual knowledge or deliberate indifference to the DPR\u2019s use of those services to support lethal terrorist activities. According to the complaint, the DPR and its supporters engaged in public fundraising campaigns on social media and other internet platforms, openly directing donors to send money to accounts held at Sberbank or to bank cards issued by Sberbank. For example, the DPR\u2019s self\u2011proclaimed governor allegedly posted Sberbank bank\u2011card details on a blog for donation purposes, and in another video the DPR\u2019s commander\u2011in\u2011chief displayed a paper listing a full Sberbank account number used for donations.\n\nPlaintiffs assert that funds transferred into Sberbank accounts for DPR\u2011related fundraisers were essential for procuring weapons, ammunition, armored vehicles, and other military supplies that the DPR used to intimidate and coerce the Ukrainian government and civilian population and to acquire and control territory, including the area from which the missile that downed MH17 was launched. According to the complaint, the DPR itself did not maintain a central bank account in its own name because it was widely recognized as a terrorist group, so fundraising entities used Sberbank accounts and cards instead.\n\nOne such group, Save Donbass, allegedly used its website to solicit donations, asking Sberbank cardholders to make direct payments to a specified card number and providing that number. Save Donbass purportedly posted reports of transfers to and from its Sberbank accounts in June and July 2014 and reported, on the day before the MH17 attack, that it had purchased armored vehicles and other military supplies for the DPR and its affiliates. A leading DPR fundraiser allegedly described the crowdfunding effort targeting Russian citizens as perhaps the largest crowdfunding campaign in post\u2011Soviet Russia and claimed that the donations \"ensured the survival\" of the DPR.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that certain DPR\u2011affiliated fundraising efforts specifically targeted donors wishing to transmit U.S.\u2011dollar funds, and directed that dollar transfers be routed through Sberbank\u2019s correspondent accounts at banks in New York City, including Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Bank of New York Mellon, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase Bank. Some of these instructions were provided in English\u2011language posts, including one that called a particular Sberbank account the \"official account to collect funds.\" A financial report posted by a DPR\u2011affiliated group on July 4, 2014, stated that \"citizens from different countries\" had transferred \"significant amounts\" of money, and reported expenditures of 1,762,690 rubles (approximately $51,000 at that time) for cash support and purchases of military equipment for the DPR.\n\nPlaintiffs identify two specific wire transfers dated June 9 and July 2, 2014, totaling $300, sent from individuals residing in Maryland and New Jersey to DPR\u2011related recipients via Sberbank\u2019s correspondent accounts in New York. They allege these transfers are non\u2011exhaustive examples and expect discovery to reveal additional transfers.\n\nAccording to the complaint, by no later than April 2014, Sberbank had actual knowledge that it was providing material support and financing to the DPR. Plaintiffs point to April 2014 media reports in outlets such as Forbes, Reuters, and the Kyiv Post that identified Sberbank as an intermediary used to fund DPR operations. One article allegedly stated that Sberbank had commenced an internal investigation into the allegations of terrorist financing; another reportedly indicated that Sberbank had contacted Ukrainian officials about the allegations. Plaintiffs contend these reports show Sberbank\u2019s awareness of DPR\u2011related fundraising through its accounts.\n\nAfter the July 17, 2014 MH17 shoot\u2011down, the U.S. Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Sberbank based on its financial dealings, including financial assistance to the DPR. Plaintiffs allege that despite these developments, Sberbank continued for some time to allow donors to use its correspondent accounts in New York City to send funds to the DPR and related entities.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On April 4, 2019, Plaintiffs\u2014surviving family members of Quinn Lucas Schansman\u2014filed an initial complaint in the Southern District of New York. They asserted claims under the Anti\u2011Terrorism Act (ATA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331 et seq., specifically invoking 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333 as the civil cause of action, and alleged that Sberbank had knowingly provided material support and financing to the DPR, in violation of ATA provisions such as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2339A and 2339C, and that this support proximately caused the terrorist act that downed MH17 and thus Quinn\u2019s death. Plaintiffs later named additional defendants in amended pleadings, including VTB Bank PJSC and several money\u2011transfer companies (Western Union Company; Western Union Financial Services, Inc.; MoneyGram International, Inc.; and MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc.).\n\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 8, 2019, and a second amended complaint on October 5, 2020, which is the operative complaint. In that pleading, Plaintiffs alleged that Sberbank provided material support and financing to the DPR by, among other things, operating and maintaining correspondent accounts in New York, allowing transfers to specified Sberbank cards and accounts associated with DPR\u2011related fundraisers, and continuing to process such transactions despite public reports and sanctions indicating DPR\u2019s terrorist activities and Sberbank\u2019s suspected role. They asserted that this conduct constituted knowing or deliberately indifferent participation in providing material support to terrorism that proximately led to the MH17 attack and Quinn\u2019s death.\n\nThe money\u2011transfer company defendants and Plaintiffs later reached a resolution, and Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against those entities were voluntarily dismissed. VTB did not assert defenses under the FSIA or ATA. Sberbank remained as a principal defendant.",
        "district_court_decision":"After Plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint, Sberbank moved to dismiss that complaint, asserting lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim under the ATA. In those earlier phases, and even after the Russian Ministry of Finance acquired a majority stake, Sberbank expressly disclaimed being an instrumentality of the Russian Federation in briefing on its earlier motions to dismiss.\n\nOn November 17, 2021, Sberbank filed its answer to the second amended complaint and, for the first time, raised an objection to subject\u2011matter jurisdiction based on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), contending that because Sberbank was majority\u2011owned by the Russian Federation (through its Central Bank and, later, the Ministry of Finance), it qualified as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state and was presumptively immune under the FSIA. With the district court\u2019s permission, Sberbank then moved on December 30, 2021, to dismiss the second amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), claiming lack of subject\u2011matter jurisdiction on two grounds: (1) immunity under the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602 et seq.; and (2) immunity under the ATA\u2019s sovereign\u2011immunity provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2337(2). Sberbank argued that it was presumptively immune as an agency or instrumentality of the Russian Federation and that no FSIA exception, including the commercial\u2011activity exception, applied. It also argued that the ATA independently barred claims against it as a foreign state or its agency.\n\nIn March 2022, the district court authorized jurisdictional discovery focused on the status and independence of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, specifically the degree of its independence from the Russian Federation and from agencies of state power, in connection with whether the Central Bank should be treated as a political subdivision of Russia under FSIA standards. The court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request for discovery into whether the Central Bank\u2019s functions were predominantly governmental or commercial and into the extent to which Sberbank\u2019s activity was used to commit unlawful acts. By November 18, 2022, the parties reported that Sberbank had produced some discovery but that disputes remained regarding the scope and schedule of that discovery.\n\nOn December 6, 2022, while the discovery dispute remained open, the district court issued a written order resolving Sberbank\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion. The court first declined to hold that Sberbank had waived its sovereign\u2011immunity defense by not raising it in earlier motions, noting that Sberbank asserted FSIA immunity in its answer to the second amended complaint. The district court then analyzed whether Sberbank qualified as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603. Relying on Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson and Abrams v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran\u00e7ais, it concluded that Sberbank\u2019s status for FSIA purposes should be assessed as of the time the suit was filed. At that time, Sberbank\u2019s majority owner was the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Applying the \u201ccore functions\u201d test developed in Garb v. Republic of Poland, the court determined that the Central Bank\u2019s core functions were predominantly governmental (such as exclusive authority over issuance and stability of the national currency), and that the Central Bank therefore qualified as a political subdivision of the Russian Federation. On that basis, the district court concluded that Sberbank was an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state and thus presumptively immune under the FSIA.\n\nThe district court next considered whether an FSIA exception applied. It focused on the commercial\u2011activity exception in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2) and determined that the gravamen of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims concerned Sberbank\u2019s provision of material support and financing to the DPR through operation of correspondent accounts and authorization of money transfers in New York. It determined that such conduct\u2014use of correspondent accounts and execution of money transfers\u2014constituted classic commercial banking activity carried on in the United States and therefore fell within the statutory definition of \u201ccommercial activity.\u201d Concluding that the claims were \"based upon\" that commercial activity, the court found the commercial\u2011activity exception applicable.\n\nFinally, the district court addressed Sberbank\u2019s argument that, independent of the FSIA, the ATA\u2019s immunity provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2337(2), barred the suit. Relying in part on Republic of Austria v. Altmann and on the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Ungar v. Palestinian Liberation Organization, the court determined that sovereign\u2011immunity assertions under the ATA should be treated as functionally equivalent to those under the FSIA, and that ATA immunity should be interpreted consistently with FSIA principles, including the commercial\u2011activity exception. On that basis, the court rejected Sberbank\u2019s ATA\u2011based immunity argument and allowed the case to proceed.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Sberbank appealed the district court\u2019s December 6, 2022 order denying its Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on sovereign\u2011immunity grounds. On appeal, Sberbank challenges (1) the district court\u2019s determination that it is not immune from suit under the FSIA in light of the commercial\u2011activity exception, and (2) the district court\u2019s conclusion that Sberbank is not immune under the ATA\u2019s immunity provision, including the court\u2019s use of FSIA principles to interpret ATA immunity. The appeal thus presents questions about whether Sberbank is entitled to presumptive immunity under the FSIA and\/or ATA, whether the FSIA commercial\u2011activity exception applies to Sberbank\u2019s alleged conduct, and whether that exception applies in the ATA context."

          "FSIA instrumentality status and timing: Sberbank contends it is presumptively immune under the FSIA because it is a separate legal person whose majority shares are owned by an organ or political subdivision of the Russian Federation. At the time the action was filed, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation held a majority stake, and Sberbank argues that the Central Bank was itself a political subdivision or organ of the Russian Federation. After April 30, 2020, the Russian Ministry of Finance acquired a majority stake in Sberbank, and Sberbank argues that, under Bartlett v. Baasiri, post\u2011filing changes in ownership that confer foreign\u2011state status must be recognized for FSIA purposes. It rejects any limitation based on alleged gamesmanship in the Ministry of Finance acquisition.",

It characterizes any use of U.S. correspondent accounts as incidental, ministerial banking functions and asserts that the alleged two transfers totaling $300 through U.S. correspondent accounts cannot plausibly constitute the core conduct of the lawsuit, nor form a sufficient factual basis to show that Sberbank\u2019s U.S.\u2011based conduct was the commercial activity upon which the action is based. Sberbank maintains that the alleged wrongful acts, including provision of funds to DPR supporters and the subsequent missile attack, occurred abroad.",
          "ATA immunity: Relying on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2337(2), Sberbank contends that the ATA independently bars civil claims against a \"foreign state\" and its agencies, and that the term \"foreign state\" there incorporates the FSIA\u2019s definition, which includes agencies and instrumentalities. Sberbank argues that ATA immunity therefore extends to instrumentalities like itself, as majority\u2011owned by a foreign state through its ministry or central bank, and that the district court erred in treating ATA immunity as coextensive with FSIA immunity only to then apply FSIA exceptions.",
          "No commercial\u2011activity exception in ATA context: Sberbank argues that even if FSIA principles determine whether it is a \"foreign state\" for ATA purposes, the ATA sets out a separate and more specific immunity framework that is distinct from the FSIA\u2019s exceptions. It notes that the ATA does not reference the FSIA\u2019s commercial\u2011activity exception and that Congress, when amending the ATA and FSIA via JASTA, provided an explicit ATA\u2011specific exception to ATA immunity for certain terrorism\u2011related claims but did not state that the FSIA commercial\u2011activity exception applies to ATA suits. Sberbank contends that, under canons of statutory construction, the later, more specific ATA immunity provision should control over the more general FSIA framework in the terrorism context, and that recognizing FSIA commercial\u2011activity exceptions within ATA suits would effectively constitute an implied partial repeal of \u00a7 2337(2).",
          "Scope of alleged knowledge and wrongdoing: Sberbank disputes the sufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that it had actual knowledge or was deliberately indifferent to DPR fundraising and terrorism. It asserts that the complaint relies heavily on media reports and generalized allegations, and contends that even if it operated correspondent accounts and processed routine banking transactions, such activity is not inherently wrongful or sufficient to constitute material support to terrorism under the ATA without more specific evidence tying Sberbank\u2019s U.S.\u2011based conduct to the MH17 attack."

Patrickson, an entity\u2019s status as an agency or instrumentality should be determined at the time the action is filed, so only the Central Bank\u2019s ownership at filing should matter. They contend that any post\u2011filing acquisition of shares by the Russian Ministry of Finance should not retroactively confer immunity. Even in light of Bartlett v. Baasiri, they argue that Sberbank\u2019s change in ownership reflects litigation\u2011motivated \"gamesmanship\" by Russia designed to manufacture FSIA immunity mid\u2011suit and that such strategic acquisitions should not be permitted to confer instrumentality status or should at least warrant further factual development on whether the change was engineered to avoid liability.",
          "Application of the FSIA commercial\u2011activity exception: Plaintiffs argue that the gravamen of their claims is Sberbank\u2019s commercial financial activity in the United States\u2014specifically, the operation of correspondent accounts and authorization of money transfers in New York for DPR\u2011related fundraising entities\u2014rather than the DPR\u2019s eventual attack on MH17. They emphasize that Sberbank, acting as a private commercial bank, facilitated a global crowdfunding operation that channeled funds through U.S. correspondent accounts to DPR supporters, with alleged knowledge of DPR\u2019s terrorist activities. They contend that use of correspondent accounts and execution of payment orders are quintessential commercial banking activities not involving sovereign powers, and that these activities occurred in the United States and are the particular conduct on which the ATA claims are based. They further assert that the two identified $300 transfers are non\u2011exclusive examples, that the complaint plausibly alleges a much larger volume of DPR\u2011directed transfers routed through U.S. accounts, and that they have been constrained by limited pre\u2011discovery access to transaction data.",
          "ATA immunity narrower than FSIA: Plaintiffs argue that the ATA\u2019s immunity provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2337(2), is textually narrower than the FSIA because it immunizes only a \"foreign state\" and an \"agency of a foreign state\" and does not mention instrumentalities. They contend that importing the FSIA\u2019s definition of \"foreign state\" into the ATA would render the phrase \"an agency of a foreign state\" superfluous and improperly extend ATA immunity to entities Congress did not intend to shield. Plaintiffs note that FSIA \u00a7 1603(a) by its terms defines \"foreign state\" only \"for purposes of\" Chapter 97 of Title 28 and does not automatically govern usage in Title 18. They maintain that \"foreign state\" in \u00a7 2337(2) should be read independently, so that entities like Sberbank, which they characterize as an instrumentality rather than an \"agency\" as that term is used in Title 18, are not covered by ATA immunity.",
          "FSIA as comprehensive regime; application of commercial\u2011activity exception to ATA suits: Plaintiffs maintain that, consistent with Amerada Hess and Altmann, the FSIA supplies the comprehensive and exclusive framework for civil sovereign\u2011immunity determinations, including in ATA cases, and that claims of foreign\u2011state immunity, whatever the underlying cause of action, must be resolved in conformity with FSIA principles and exceptions. They argue that assertions of immunity under the ATA are \"functionally equivalent\" to FSIA immunity claims, as recognized by the First Circuit in Ungar v. Palestinian Liberation Organization, and that, therefore, if Sberbank is treated as a foreign state or instrumentality under the FSIA for ATA purposes, it must also be subject to the same FSIA exceptions, including \u00a7 1605(a)(2)\u2019s commercial\u2011activity exception. Plaintiffs contend there is no textual or legislative basis to conclude that Congress intended ATA immunity to override or supplant the FSIA\u2019s restrictive theory of sovereign immunity or its commercial\u2011activity exception, and that JASTA\u2019s purpose and structure support broad civil remedies for terrorism victims, not reduced accountability for foreign sovereigns engaged in commercial support for terrorism.",
          "Link between Sberbank\u2019s U.S. conduct and alleged terrorism: Plaintiffs argue that Sberbank\u2019s alleged conduct in using U.S. correspondent accounts to route funds to DPR\u2011related entities with knowledge of DPR\u2019s terrorist activities falls squarely within the ATA\u2019s prohibitions on providing material support and financing to terrorists. They maintain that the wrongful act in this case is the financial facilitation itself\u2014\"moving money for a fee\" to known or suspected terrorist actors\u2014carried out, in significant part, through banking operations in the United States, and that the MH17 attack is a downstream consequence of that financial support. They analogize their claims to cases such as Rodriguez v. Pan American Health Organization, where a court focused on the alleged financial intermediary conduct in the United States as the gravamen of the suit when determining the applicability of the commercial\u2011activity exception."

The district court held that (a) ownership is measured at filing, and (b) at filing the Central Bank\u2019s majority ownership made Sberbank an instrumentality because the Central Bank is a political subdivision under the core\u2011functions test. That analysis is consistent with Dole Food and Second Circuit precedent (Garb), and Bartlett v. Baasiri only adds that post\u2011filing acquisitions can also confer immunity; it does not negate immunity that already exists at filing. The record indicates the Central Bank\u2019s core functions (monetary policy, currency issuance, financial stability) are predominantly governmental, so treating it as a political subdivision is well supported. Any \u2018gamesmanship\u2019 argument about the later transfer to the Ministry of Finance is largely moot if Sberbank already qualified at the time of filing.

The district court found the gravamen of the claim is Sberbank\u2019s operation and use of U.S. correspondent accounts to process DPR\u2011directed transfers, not the DPR\u2019s firing of the missile itself. Under Weltover and Nelson, using correspondent accounts and executing wire transfers is classic commercial activity: the bank is acting like a private market participant, not as a sovereign. Under Sachs\u2019s gravamen analysis, the core conduct for which Sberbank is sued is that commercial banking activity, alleged to have occurred, in part, in New York. The fact that plaintiffs presently identify only two specific $300 transfers is not dispositive at the pleading stage, because they plausibly allege a large crowdfunding operation routed through those accounts and explain that the details of additional transfers are in Sberbank\u2019s control. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the action is 'based upon' commercial activity carried on in the United States by Sberbank fits the statutory text and Supreme Court precedent, so the commercial\u2011activity exception properly abrogates FSIA immunity on the pleadings."

          "reasoning":"Interpretation of ATA \u00a7 2337(2) is purely legal and reviewed de novo. The district court treated ATA immunity as functionally equivalent to FSIA immunity and interpreted 'foreign state' in \u00a7 2337(2) in light of FSIA principles. The statutory text in \u00a7 2337(2) bars suits against a 'foreign state, an agency of a foreign state, or an officer or employee of a foreign state or an agency thereof.' If 'foreign state' were automatically imported wholesale from FSIA \u00a7 1603(a) (which already includes agencies and instrumentalities), then adding 'an agency of a foreign state' would be surplusage, a result disfavored by canons of construction. Moreover, FSIA \u00a7 1603(a) by its terms defines 'foreign state' 'for purposes of this chapter' (Title 28, Chapter 97) and does not govern Title 18 unless Congress says so. The more coherent reading is that ATA \u00a7 2337(2) defines its own immunity category and at least does not automatically expand immunity beyond what FSIA would recognize once FSIA\u2019s exceptions are applied. Amerada Hess and Altmann emphasize FSIA as the comprehensive regime for civil immunity; they do not suggest that a separate Title 18 provision can override FSIA\u2019s exceptions sub silentio. The district court\u2019s approach, which prevents \u00a7 2337(2) from enlarging immunity beyond FSIA\u2019s contours, is therefore likely to be upheld."

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"Whether FSIA exceptions, including the commercial\u2011activity exception, limit immunity in an ATA action is a question of statutory interpretation reviewed de novo. FSIA \u00a7 1602 states that claims of foreign sovereign immunity in U.S. courts are to be decided 'in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter,' i.e., including \u00a7 1605\u2019s exceptions. Amerada Hess describes FSIA as providing the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in civil cases. Reading ATA \u00a7 2337(2) to create a freestanding, broader immunity untethered from FSIA\u2019s exceptions would conflict with that regime and would amount to an implied repeal of FSIA \u00a7 1605(a)(2) in the terrorism context, which courts strongly disfavor absent clear congressional intent. JASTA\u2019s structure reinforces that Congress sought to enhance, not contract, civil accountability for terrorism\u2011related conduct, and when Congress wanted to create terrorism\u2011specific immunity rules (e.g., FSIA \u00a7 1605B, ATA \u00a7 2333(d)(2)), it did so explicitly. There is no indication Congress meant ATA \u00a7 2337(2) to insulate foreign\u2011state commercial banking activities from FSIA\u2019s well\u2011established exceptions. The district court\u2019s holding that any ATA\u2011based claim of sovereign immunity must still be analyzed subject to FSIA\u2019s exceptions, including the commercial\u2011activity exception that applies here, is therefore likely to be affirmed."

      "reasoning":"The appeal turns entirely on questions of sovereign immunity, which are reviewed de novo. On the threshold FSIA status question (issue 1), the district court\u2019s reasoning tracks Supreme Court and Second Circuit authority: Sberbank is majority\u2011owned by an entity (the Central Bank) whose core functions are governmental, making Sberbank an 'agency or instrumentality' of the Russian Federation at the time of filing. Bartlett\u2019s holding on post\u2011filing acquisitions, if anything, reinforces immunity; it does not undermine the district court\u2019s earlier\u2011in\u2011time analysis. Both parties seem to accept that, if the Central Bank is a political subdivision, presumptive FSIA immunity attaches.\n\nOn issue 2, the court\u2019s application of the commercial\u2011activity exception is doctrinally solid. The nature of the alleged conduct\u2014operating correspondent accounts and executing wire transfers in New York for DPR\u2011related fundraisers\u2014is quintessential commercial banking, not the exercise of sovereign authority. Under Sachs, the gravamen analysis focuses on the defendant\u2019s conduct that directly underlies the claim. Here, the ATA claims are framed around Sberbank\u2019s knowing provision of financial services; the missile launch is the downstream injury. At the pleading stage, the court may credit plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that many DPR\u2011related transfers flowed through U.S. accounts; the identification of only two specific $300 transfers does not defeat the plausibility of broader U.S.\u2011based commercial activity.\n\nIssues 3 and 4 involve statutory interpretation of the ATA in relation to the FSIA. The district court\u2019s view\u2014that ATA immunity is construed consistently with FSIA and cannot expand sovereign immunity beyond the limits and exceptions Congress established in FSIA\u2014is strongly supported by Amerada Hess, Altmann, FSIA\u2019s \u00a7 1602 preamble, and by Ungar\u2019s reasoning that ATA and FSIA immunity are functionally equivalent. Reading 'foreign state' in \u00a7 2337(2) to incorporate the FSIA definition wholesale would make 'agency of a foreign state' redundant and would imply that Congress silently overrode FSIA\u2019s commercial\u2011activity exception in terrorism cases, a result inconsistent with canons against surplusage and against implied repeals. JASTA\u2019s focus on broadening remedies for terrorism victims further militates against interpreting \u00a7 2337(2) as a super\u2011immunity shield that survives FSIA exceptions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the appellate court is likely to affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Sberbank\u2019s Rule 12(b)(1) motion in full, leaving the case to proceed on the merits under the ATA with FSIA immunity abrogated by the commercial\u2011activity exception."

      "factual_background":"In November 2004, Julio A. Rodr\u00edguez\u2011M\u00e9ndez participated in a carjacking in Puerto Rico while in possession of a firearm. His conduct led to successive prosecutions in Puerto Rico\u2019s Commonwealth courts and in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. \n\nFirst, in the Commonwealth court, Rodr\u00edguez was charged with robbery of a motor vehicle in violation of Article 173B of the Puerto Rico Penal Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33 \u00a7 4279b (repealed 2004), and carrying a weapon without a license in violation of Article 5.04 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, \u00a7 458c (repealed 2013). He pled guilty to these Commonwealth offenses and received a sentence of twelve years' imprisonment.\n\nFollowing this Commonwealth conviction, a federal grand jury indicted Rodr\u00edguez on three counts arising from the same 2004 carjacking incident: (1) aiding and abetting a carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 2119; (2) aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 924(c); and (3) unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon (felon\u2011in\u2011possession), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). \n\nThe indictment further alleged that Rodr\u00edguez qualified as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), on the basis of at least three prior convictions for robbery of a motor vehicle under Article 173B. A presentence investigation report identified these ACCA predicates as convictions under Article 173 (armed robbery), but the parties later agreed they were actually for robbery of a motor vehicle under Article 173B.\n\nRodr\u00edguez pled guilty in federal court to the felon\u2011in\u2011possession count. In exchange, the government dismissed the remaining federal charges. \n\nArticle 173B of the Puerto Rico Penal Code, under which Rodr\u00edguez previously had been convicted, defined motor\u2011vehicle robbery as unlawfully appropriating a motor vehicle belonging to another, taking it from the person or the person's possession, in his or her immediate presence and against his or her will, through \"the use of violence or intimidation,\" while \"using an object capable of causing grave bodily injury.\" Puerto Rico law, through Article 174 (P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, \u00a7 4280, repealed 2004), defined \"intimidation\" broadly to include threats not only against a person but also against property.",

        "claims_brought":"After being federally indicted, Rodr\u00edguez pled guilty to the federal felon\u2011in\u2011possession charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and the government dismissed the aiding and abetting carjacking and \u00a7 924(c) firearm charges. Because of his prior Article 173B motor\u2011vehicle\u2011robbery convictions, the sentencing court treated him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), which increased the statutory penalties for the \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense. In November 2006, the district court sentenced him to 216 months' imprisonment on the felon\u2011in\u2011possession conviction, applying the ACCA enhancement. Rodr\u00edguez filed a notice of direct appeal but voluntarily dismissed it in October 2008 and did not seek collateral relief within one year of the conviction becoming final.\n\nSubsequently, there were two major legal developments: (1) in June 2015, the Supreme Court decided Johnson v. United States (Johnson II), holding that the ACCA's residual clause was unconstitutionally vague; and (2) in June 2016, the Supreme Court decided Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, holding that Puerto Rico and the United States are the same sovereign for double\u2011jeopardy purposes and barring successive prosecutions by those two governments for the same offense.\n\nApproximately three months after S\u00e1nchez Valle, Rodr\u00edguez, proceeding pro se, filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the District of Puerto Rico seeking to vacate his federal felon\u2011in\u2011possession conviction on double jeopardy grounds. After counsel was appointed, he amended the \u00a7 2255 motion to add a separate challenge to his ACCA enhancement, arguing that, in light of Johnson II, his three prior Article 173B motor\u2011vehicle\u2011robbery convictions no longer qualified as ACCA predicate offenses.",

The court reasoned that Rodr\u00edguez had failed to satisfy what it described as the \"stone set privity requirement\" necessary for his double\u2011jeopardy theory. \n\nOn the ACCA claim, the district court examined whether Rodr\u00edguez's prior Article 173B convictions were \"violent felonies\" under the ACCA after Johnson II. The court held that Article 173B offenses did qualify as ACCA predicates under the ACCA's force clause because the offense required that the defendant commit motor\u2011vehicle robbery \"using an object capable of causing grave bodily injury,\" which the court interpreted as satisfying the requirement that the offense have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" Accordingly, the district court upheld the ACCA enhancement and denied the \u00a7 2255 motion in full.

          "On the ACCA issue, Rodr\u00edguez asserts that, after Johnson II invalidated the ACCA residual clause, his Article 173B motor\u2011vehicle\u2011robbery convictions no longer qualify as ACCA \"violent felonies.\" Applying the categorical approach, he contends that Article 173B\u2019s element of committing the offense \"through the use of violence or intimidation\" is indivisible and too broad. In particular, because Puerto Rico law (Article 174) defines \"intimidation\" to include threats against property as well as persons, the least culpable conduct under Article 173B includes intimidation of property only, which does not require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another as required by the ACCA force clause. He also argues that Article 173B does not match any ACCA enumerated offense: it is not generic extortion because it does not require that the victim\u2019s consent to part with property be induced, and any taking can be wholly against the victim\u2019s will; and, by its terms, it is a robbery statute focused on non\u2011consensual takings, not on extortionate inducement of consent. He further maintains (in an argument the appellate court notes but does not resolve in detail) that Article 173B can be violated with a mens rea of recklessness, which would also fall outside the ACCA\u2019s definition of a violent felony."

          "On double jeopardy, the government defends the district court\u2019s rejection of the claim but on different grounds than the district court. It argues first that Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 double\u2011jeopardy claim fails because Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle does not apply retroactively on collateral review, so he cannot rely on S\u00e1nchez Valle to invalidate his previously final conviction. Alternatively, the government contends that even if S\u00e1nchez Valle were applied retroactively and Puerto Rico and the United States are treated as one sovereign, there is no double\u2011jeopardy violation under Blockburger because federal felon\u2011in\u2011possession under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and carrying a firearm without a license under Puerto Rico\u2019s Article 5.04 are different offenses. Citing prior circuit precedent (United States v. Almonte\u2011N\u00fa\u00f1ez), the government notes that \u00a7 922(g)(1) requires proof that the defendant is a prohibited person (a felon) and that the firearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce, neither of which Article 5.04 requires, while Article 5.04 requires proof that the firearm was unlicensed, which \u00a7 922(g)(1) does not.",
          "On the ACCA issue, the government argues that Rodr\u00edguez was properly designated an armed career criminal. It maintains that Article 173B motor\u2011vehicle robbery qualifies as a violent felony under the force clause because the statute requires that the perpetrator use \"an object capable of causing grave bodily injury\" and commit the offense \"through the use of violence or intimidation.\" The government asserts that even where intimidation under Puerto Rico law might involve threats directed at property, in the context of a carjacking carried out with a dangerous object, any such threat effectively constitutes a threat of physical force against the person present during the robbery. In the alternative, the government argues that Article 173B qualifies under the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offense clause as the generic offense of extortion. It characterizes Article 173B carjackings accomplished through intimidation (including intimidation directed at property) as situations in which the victim acquiesces and parts with the vehicle \"against his\/her will\" due to the perpetrator\u2019s threats, and it contends that this dynamic amounts to obtaining property from another with his or her consent induced by wrongful use of force, fear, or threats, which matches the generic definition of extortion. The government relies on decisions from other circuits that view the distinction between takings \"against the victim\u2019s will\" and takings with consent induced by threats as insubstantial for purposes of the extortion definition, and urges that Article 173B falls within that generic extortion category."

          "reasoning":"The question is purely legal: whether the federal \u00a7 922(g)(1) felon\u2011in\u2011possession prosecution following the Puerto Rico Article 5.04 conviction is barred as the \u201csame offence\u201d under the Double Jeopardy Clause after S\u00e1nchez Valle. Even assuming (without deciding) that S\u00e1nchez Valle applies retroactively on collateral review, the Blockburger test is dispositive. Section 922(g)(1) requires proof that the defendant is a felon and that the firearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce; Article 5.04 requires proof that the weapon was unlicensed. Each offense thus has elements the other does not. The First Circuit has already recognized this mismatch of elements in a similar Puerto Rico\u2013federal pairing (e.g., Almonte\u2011N\u00fa\u00f1ez). The fact that both prosecutions arise from the same conduct and that both statutes aim in a broad sense at firearm possession does not override Blockburger\u2019s same\u2011elements test. Nor is there any special doctrinal exception allowing a more \u201cflexible\u201d approach merely because the statutes come from different legislatures that now count as a single sovereign. On de novo review, the federal and Commonwealth offenses are not the same under Blockburger, so there is no double\u2011jeopardy violation, and denial of relief on this claim is affirmed, even if the district court\u2019s \u201cprivity\u201d rationale was incorrect."

          "reasoning":"Whether a prior conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA is a legal question reviewed de novo and resolved under the categorical approach. Article 173B defines motor\u2011vehicle robbery as a taking \u201cthrough the use of violence or intimidation\u201d using an object capable of causing grave bodily injury, and Puerto Rico Article 174 expressly defines \u201cintimidation\u201d to include threats to property, not just to persons. The least culpable conduct covered by Article 173B therefore includes a non\u2011consensual vehicle taking accomplished by threatening only to damage property (for example, threatening to smash the car or burn a nearby building) while brandishing a dangerous object, without any threat of force against a person. Under Johnson I and the ACCA force clause, \u201cphysical force\u201d must be force against the person of another; intimidation directed solely at property does not satisfy \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Because the statute is not textually divisible as between intimidation of persons and intimidation of property, the categorical approach requires considering this non\u2011qualifying least\u2011culpable conduct, and the prior convictions therefore cannot be counted via the force clause. Nor does Article 173B categorically match generic extortion under the enumerated\u2011offense clause: generic extortion requires obtaining property with the victim\u2019s consent induced by wrongful threats, whereas Article 173B robbery, by its terms, targets takings from the person or her possession \u201cagainst his or her will,\u201d i.e., non\u2011consensual robberies. That structural difference between robbery (taking against the will) and extortion (consent induced by threat) is substantive, not a trivial semantic distinction. With the residual clause unavailable after Johnson II, Article 173B cannot be an ACCA predicate. The district court\u2019s reliance on the dangerous\u2011object requirement does not cure the overbreadth regarding the target of intimidation. Accordingly, on de novo review, the ACCA designation and 216\u2011month sentence must be set aside, and the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief on this issue is reversed."

      "reasoning":"The double\u2011jeopardy challenge turns entirely on Blockburger. Existing First Circuit precedent and the clear element differences between \u00a7 922(g)(1) and Puerto Rico Article 5.04 make it very likely the court will find no \u201csame offence,\u201d irrespective of any retroactivity debate about S\u00e1nchez Valle, and thus affirm denial of relief on that claim (even if the district court\u2019s reasoning is corrected). By contrast, after Johnson II the only viable ACCA bases are the force clause and enumerated\u2011offense clause. Puerto Rico\u2019s Article 173B incorporates an intimidation definition that plainly reaches threats to property alone, so the minimum conduct criminalized does not require force or threatened force against the person of another, as ACCA\u2019s force clause demands. And the statute, on its face, describes robbery by non\u2011consensual taking, not extortion by consent induced by threats. Under the categorical approach, those features render Article 173B overbroad and not a match for either clause. Appellate courts in similar settings have increasingly refused to recharacterize broad robbery\u2011type statutes as generic extortion simply because threats can induce acquiescence. That makes reversal on the ACCA issue and remand for resentencing without the ACCA enhancement substantially more likely, producing a mixed outcome: conviction and rejection of the double\u2011jeopardy claim affirmed, ACCA enhancement reversed."

      },
      "factual_background":"Lorna Orabona began working as a Mortgage Development Officer (MDO) for Sovereign Bank in 2008. In 2013, Santander Bank, N.A. acquired Sovereign, and Orabona became a Santander employee. She was paid entirely on commission and was described as one of the top five MDO performers nationwide for Santander. Her commission earnings were approximately $525,000 in 2020 and $680,000 in 2021.\n\nOn or about January 18, 2022, Orabona informed her Santander supervisor that she had an offer of employment from Citizens Bank but was still considering remaining at Santander and wished to renegotiate her compensation. According to her, the supervisor responded that he wanted her to stay and would speak with his superiors to work something out.\n\nOn January 21, 2022, a Santander employee based in Spain, who was not her supervisor and did not work in her department, together with a Santander HR employee and a Santander IT employee, called Orabona and informed her that her employment was being terminated effective immediately for cause. The stated reason was that she had forwarded company emails from her Santander work email address to her personal email account. Orabona states in an affidavit that she was told all of her benefits, including healthcare, would cease immediately. She further avers that she was told if she took further actions such as appealing her termination or applying for benefits, Santander would report to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) that she had committed misconduct, allegedly in an attempt to have her license revoked.\n\nSantander\u2019s Rule 30(b)(6) corporate witness, Michael Pagano, testified that typically a manager communicates a termination to an employee and a member of the Employment Relations team (based in the United States) supports that communication, answers questions, and explains what to expect from a benefits standpoint after separation.\n\nThere is a factual dispute regarding when Orabona began employment with Citizens Bank. Orabona\u2019s affidavit states she did not accept Citizens\u2019 offer or begin employment there until January 24, 2022, after her termination by Santander. Santander points to Orabona\u2019s NMLS registration, which reflects a Citizens employment start date of January 18, 2022.\n\nOrabona states she received no prior warning or reprimand regarding the forwarding of emails before her termination. She claims she forwarded company emails to her personal account because she was working remotely during the COVID-19 state of emergency since March 2020; she says the emails were encrypted and did not contain personal information. She also asserts that other Santander employees working remotely similarly forwarded company emails to their personal accounts and were neither reprimanded nor terminated. She characterizes the forwarded emails as mortgage pre\u2011approval letters for client referrals, and she does not deny that they contained confidential client and Santander business information.\n\nIn the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2021, and prior to Orabona\u2019s termination, Santander decided to completely exit the U.S. residential mortgage market. This decision was expected to lead to layoffs of all MDOs in the residential mortgages department, which included Orabona\u2019s role. On or about February 1, 2022, a few days after Orabona\u2019s January 21 termination, Santander officially announced a large national layoff in its residential lending department that terminated all MDOs in that department and eliminated Orabona\u2019s position.\n\nOrabona contends that the reasons Santander provided for her termination were pretextual and that the timing of her January 21, 2022, termination was selected to make her ineligible for severance benefits that would be available in connection with the February 1, 2022, layoff. She alleges that a potential severance payment to her would have been significant given her high earnings and that Santander terminated her for cause and concealed the planned large\u2011scale layoff to deprive her of eligibility for benefits, including severance.\n\nOn December 9, 2021, before her termination, Santander\u2019s HR department emailed Orabona a link to a summary of the 2020 Form 5500 for the Santander U.S. Enterprise Severance Policy (the \"Severance Policy\"). The record also contains Forms 5500 for the Severance Policy for 2020, 2021, and 2022, the Severance Policy in effect from July 21, 2021 through July 17, 2022, and Santander\u2019s Code of Conduct as of December 16, 2021.\n\nThe Severance Policy provides that Santander\u2019s current policy is to provide severance benefits to full- or part-time employees whose positions are involuntarily terminated as a result of certain events, including workforce reduction or position elimination. It further states that employees are not entitled to severance benefits if their employment is terminated for certain reasons, including misconduct or violation of company policies, procedures, practices, or the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Code of Conduct includes policies about employee use of corporate assets and expressly prohibits sending, forwarding, or transmitting Santander U.S. information to a personal email account, personal messaging application, or similar platform for any reason. It states that employees who violate the Code may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and emphasizes that employment at Santander U.S. is generally at will.\n\nThe Severance Policy specifies conditions for receiving severance once an employee is found eligible and qualified, including execution of a separation agreement and remaining in the employee\u2019s position through the termination date. It provides that no severance benefits are paid to an employee who resigns before the termination date. For employees earning commissions, the severance pay calculation is based on the greater of (1) a benefits-pay amount used to determine salary-related benefits in the year of termination, or (2) the average, annualized earnings over the prior 6 to 24 months based on time in the commissioned role, with certain reductions (to 80% or 65% of average earnings) for higher-earning employees above specified income thresholds. The policy reserves to Santander \"sole discretion\" to decide whether any employee will receive severance benefits, the terms and conditions for such payment, whether those conditions are satisfied, and the amount of severance.\n\nThe Severance Policy also provides that all claims for benefits must be made in writing to HR within 60 days of the event giving rise to the claim, and that an employee may appeal any denial by submitting a written request for review within 60 days after receiving the denial. It states that an employee must exhaust the claims and appeal process before filing suit.\n\nSantander\u2019s 30(b)(6) witness testified that any employee, including one terminated for cause, may file a claim with HR seeking severance benefits if the employee believes they are still entitled to severance. Orabona concedes that she did not take any steps to appeal her termination or apply for benefits. She attributes this failure to her reliance on the alleged statements during the January 21, 2022, termination call that she was ineligible for benefits and that Santander would report her to the NMLS for misconduct if she took further action, such as appealing or applying for benefits.\n\nThe summary judgment record reflects a dispute over whether Santander normally provides a separation guide to terminated employees and whether such a guide was provided to Orabona. Orabona says she did not receive one. Santander\u2019s 30(b)(6) witness testified that the separation guide, where given, contains information about matters like COBRA coverage and life insurance conversion but does not reference the Severance Policy.\n\nThe core of Orabona\u2019s lawsuit is her allegation that Santander, facing a planned large\u2011scale layoff that would have triggered a significant severance payout to her under the Severance Policy, falsely characterized her termination as \"for cause\" and concealed the layoff in order to deprive her of eligibility for severance and other benefits.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On June 22, 2023, Orabona filed suit against Santander in Rhode Island Superior Court. After limited discovery and amendment, she asserted four state-law causes of action: (1) breach of implied contract and covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (2) wrongful termination, (3) fraud and intentional misrepresentation, and (4) negligent misrepresentation. In each count she sought damages to be proven at trial, plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs, punitive damages, and other relief deemed appropriate. Her theory across these claims was that Santander wrongfully and pretextually terminated her for cause to interfere with her continued employment and to avoid paying severance benefits and other employee benefits.",
        "district_court_decision":"Santander removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. It initially moved to dismiss all claims for failure to state a claim and on the ground that the claims were preempted by ERISA. Santander attached to its motion a version of the Severance Policy. Orabona opposed, disputing the authenticity and applicability of the version Santander submitted and requesting discovery to determine the actual terms of any ERISA plan and whether it qualified as an ERISA plan. The district court denied Santander\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice and allowed both parties limited discovery focused on the applicability and authenticity of the potential ERISA plan.\n\nAfter this discovery, Orabona filed an amended complaint asserting the four state-law claims described above. Santander then filed a combined motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim and for summary judgment based on ERISA preemption. Santander argued that Orabona\u2019s claims were preempted because each count \"relates to\" the ERISA-governed Severance Policy and would require reference to the plan to determine liability and damages.\n\nOn September 25, 2024, the district court issued a Memorandum and Order granting summary judgment to Santander on ERISA preemption grounds. The court concluded that all of Orabona\u2019s state-law claims were preempted by ERISA \u00a7 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). It reasoned that the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims were preempted because the natural measure of damages would be the value of severance benefits defined by the Severance Policy, and it relied in part on Otero Carrasquillo v. Pharmacia Corp. For the breach of implied contract and wrongful termination claims, the district court noted that Orabona had conceded that severance benefits would be part of the consequential damages she sought. The court concluded that calculating her damages on those claims would require reference to the Severance Policy.",

According to Santander, to determine liability on any of these claims, the court must evaluate and interpret the ERISA-governed Severance Policy and associated Code of Conduct provisions, including eligibility criteria, the effect of termination \"for cause,\" and the plan\u2019s discretionary provisions.",

Santander suggests that Orabona\u2019s failure to use the plan\u2019s administrative process underscores that she is attempting an improper end-run around ERISA by recharacterizing what is effectively a benefits dispute as state-law tort and contract claims."

          "reasoning":"Whether ERISA \u00a7 514(a) preempts these state-law causes of action is a pure question of law, reviewed de novo. On the summary-judgment record, the severance arrangement is plainly an ERISA plan: there is a written Severance Policy, Forms 5500 filed for multiple years, and an ongoing administrative scheme for determining eligibility, the amount of benefits (with income-based formulas and reductions), and claims\/appeals procedures. After limited discovery targeted at those points, the authenticity and ERISA status of the plan are no longer seriously contestable.\n\nThe core factual theory of every claim is that Santander pretextually labeled the termination as \u2018for cause\u2019 and concealed a pending RIF in order to deprive Orabona of severance and related benefits that otherwise would have been triggered. Liability for the implied-contract, good\u2011faith, wrongful\u2011termination, fraud, and negligent\u2011misrepresentation counts all turns on whether it was wrongful for Santander to treat her as ineligible for severance and to threaten her about pursuing benefits. That inquiry necessarily requires determining what the Severance Policy actually provides\u2014who is eligible, what \u2018for cause\u2019 and \u2018misconduct\u2019 mean under the plan and Code of Conduct, and whether she in fact stood to receive severance in connection with the February 1 layoff.\n\nThe measure of damages is likewise inextricably tied to the plan: the centerpiece of her claimed harm is the loss of a \u2018significant\u2019 severance payment, calculated only by applying the Severance Policy\u2019s commission\u2011based formula, thresholds, and discretionary components. Under First Circuit precedent such as Otero\u2011Carrasquillo v.

Here, her attempt to characterize severance as only one component of damages does not change that her theory of liability and primary economic loss is anchored in the Severance Policy.\n\nNor can the need to interpret the Code of Conduct be cabined as a purely non\u2011ERISA employment issue. The Code is expressly incorporated into the plan\u2019s eligibility and \u2018for cause\u2019 provisions, and determining whether the alleged misconduct justified denial of severance will require construing those plan-related standards. Given that adjudicating these state claims would require more than a mere arithmetic reference to the plan and would instead entail evaluating eligibility, exclusions, and discretionary determinations under the Severance Policy, they have the requisite \u2018connection with or reference to\u2019 an ERISA plan and are preempted under \u00a7 514(a)."

          "reasoning":"Whether the claims are displaced by ERISA\u2019s exclusive civil enforcement mechanism under \u00a7 502(a) is also a legal question reviewed de novo. Orabona\u2019s factual narrative maps directly onto causes of action that ERISA itself provides: she alleges she was fired early, and for pretextual \u2018for cause\u2019 reasons, to prevent her from receiving severance and associated employee benefits that would have been due in connection with a planned layoff. That is functionally a \u00a7 510 interference theory (\u2018discharge... for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right\u2019 under a plan), enforceable exclusively via \u00a7 502(a).\n\nHer requested relief\u2014back pay or front pay tied to lost employment plus the \u2018significant\u2019 severance and other benefits she says she would have received under the Severance Policy\u2014is, at bottom, an attempt to recover plan benefits and to redress an alleged interference with the attainment of those benefits. Dressing that theory in the garb of wrongful termination, fraud, or negligent misrepresentation does not change its substance. Under Supreme Court and First Circuit authority, state-law claims that duplicate, supplement, or supplant \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) and \u00a7 510 remedies are completely preempted.\n\nThat she also pleads punitive and other consequential damages does not rescue the claims from preemption; allowing those additional remedies would expand and alter ERISA\u2019s carefully reticulated remedial scheme, precisely what \u00a7 502(a) forbids. Likewise, her failure to exhaust the plan\u2019s internal claims and appeals procedures, while potentially relevant to a future ERISA action, underscores that she is seeking an end\u2011run around ERISA by recasting what is essentially a benefits\u2011interference dispute as a suite of state tort and contract claims. Because the gravamen of her suit is denial and interference with severance benefits due under an ERISA plan, the district court correctly held that those claims are within ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement field and therefore preempted."

The summary judgment record shows that Santander maintained an ERISA-governed severance plan and that all of Orabona\u2019s state-law theories are built around the assertion that Santander manipulated the timing and characterization of her termination to deprive her of severance benefits and other plan-related advantages. Determining liability and, especially, the primary measure of her damages would require interpreting and applying that Severance Policy and its incorporated Code of Conduct, not merely consulting it in a peripheral way. Under established preemption doctrine, those close connections mean her claims \u2018relate to\u2019 the plan within \u00a7 514(a). At the same time, the complaint\u2019s theory fits squarely within the domain of ERISA\u2019s own causes of action\u2014recovery of benefits and protection against interference with benefit rights\u2014so allowing these state-law claims would impermissibly supplement and expand ERISA\u2019s exclusive remedies under \u00a7 502(a).

      "factual_background":"The case concerns a constitutional challenge to provisions of the Massachusetts firearms statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, \u00a7 131M, commonly referred to as the Massachusetts assault weapons and large-capacity magazine ban (the \"Massachusetts Ban\" or the \"Ban\"). The Ban makes it a crime to sell, offer to sell, transfer, or possess an \"assault weapon\" or a \"large capacity feeding device\" (LCM) that was not lawfully possessed on September 13, 1994. A first violation by a person not licensed under \u00a7 122 is punishable by a fine of $1,000 to $10,000, or imprisonment from one to ten years, or both; a second offense carries higher fines and longer imprisonment terms.\n\nThe statute defines \"assault weapon\" by incorporating the definition of a \"semiautomatic assault weapon\" that appeared in the now-lapsed federal Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(30), as of September 13, 1994, and by listing specific models (e.g., Avtomat Kalashnikov (AK) models, UZI, Galil, Beretta AR70, Colt AR-15, certain Fabrique National rifles, certain SWD models, Steyr AUG, INTRATEC TEC series, and revolving cylinder shotguns such as the Street Sweeper and Striker 12). Under the incorporated federal definition, a \"semiautomatic assault weapon\" includes: (1) certain named models; (2) a semiautomatic rifle with a detachable magazine and at least two of several listed military-style features (such as a folding or telescoping stock, pistol grip, bayonet mount, flash suppressor or threaded barrel, or grenade launcher); (3) a semiautomatic pistol with a detachable magazine and at least two listed features (such as a magazine attaching outside the pistol grip, threaded barrel for attachments, barrel shroud, heavy weight, or being a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm); and (4) a semiautomatic shotgun with at least two listed features (folding\/telescoping stock, pistol grip, fixed magazine capacity over five rounds, or ability to accept a detachable magazine).\n\nThe Massachusetts statute defines a \"large capacity feeding device\" as a fixed or detachable magazine, box, drum, feed strip, or similar device capable of accepting, or readily convertible to accept, more than ten rounds of ammunition or more than five shotgun shells, or as a large capacity ammunition feeding device under the federal 1994 act. The definition excludes attached tubular devices designed to accept and operate only with .22 caliber ammunition.\n\nAccording to the record described in the opinion, the Massachusetts Ban targets two main categories of items: (1) \"assault weapons\" (including certain semiautomatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns with specified features, and several named models such as the Colt AR\u201115) and (2) large capacity feeding devices. The Commonwealth's evidence, including expert submissions, characterizes rifles such as the AR-15 as lightweight, accurate, semiautomatic rifles capable of rapid fire, originally derived from a design for the U.S. military, with high-velocity ammunition that can penetrate typical building materials and cause severe bodily injury. One Commonwealth expert states that the AR\u201115's need for two-handed operation and its ability to fire ammunition that easily penetrates common household construction materials undercut any perceived advantage over handguns for home self-defense. The record also includes expert material that semiautomatic rifles cause on average substantially more deaths and injuries in mass shootings than \"regular\" firearms, and that the AR\u201115\u2019s combination of high bullet velocity, relatively manageable recoil, and rapid rate of fire enhances its lethality, with those effects further compounded when used with LCMs.\n\nAppellant Joseph R. Capen is a law-abiding Massachusetts resident who alleges that, but for a credible threat of prosecution under \u00a7 131M, he would purchase firearms and magazines covered by the Ban (described in the pleadings as \"Banned Firearms\" and \"Banned Magazines\") to keep in his home for self-defense and other lawful purposes. The National Association for Gun Rights alleges it is a nonprofit whose members include Massachusetts residents who are law-abiding citizens and who likewise would purchase firearms and magazines covered by the Ban for self-defense and other lawful purposes but refrain from doing so due to the threat of enforcement. The Association\u2019s president submitted a declaration stating in general terms that the members on whose behalf the action is brought are Massachusetts residents and law-abiding U.S. citizens; the complaint itself does not identify a specific member whose interests are affected.\n\nThe Attorney General of Massachusetts, through public statements and legislative history cited in the record, has framed the purpose of the Ban as reducing criminal access to particularly dangerous firearms and magazines and addressing public safety concerns associated with mass shootings and gun violence, including the use of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines to inflict multiple casualties quickly. A 2004 gubernatorial press release quoted then-Governor Mitt Romney as stating that \"deadly assault weapons have no place in Massachusetts\" and that the Ban was intended to make it harder for criminals to obtain such weapons and to help keep Massachusetts streets and neighborhoods safe.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On September 7, 2022, Capen and the National Association for Gun Rights filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Massachusetts Attorney General in her official capacity. They sought: (1) a declaratory judgment that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 140, \u00a7 131M is facially unconstitutional under the Second Amendment; or, in the alternative, (2) a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 131M is unconstitutional as applied to law-abiding adults seeking to acquire, use, transfer, or possess arms that are in common use by the American public for lawful purposes. The complaint requested preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting enforcement of \u00a7 131M's provisions relating to assault weapons and large capacity feeding devices. Initially, the complaint also named the Governor of Massachusetts as a defendant, but the parties later stipulated to dismiss the Governor from the case. The plaintiffs challenged three aspects of the statutory scheme: two definitional provisions (the definitions of \"assault weapon\" and \"large capacity feeding device\" in \u00a7 121) and one enforcement provision (\u00a7 131M\u2019s prohibition on sale, transfer, and possession).\n\nOn November 9, 2022, plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (\"PI Motion\") seeking to preliminarily enjoin enforcement of the Ban as to both the assault-weapon and LCM restrictions while the case was litigated on the merits. The Attorney General, on behalf of the Commonwealth, opposed the PI Motion. The Commonwealth also raised standing objections in its Answer, arguing that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged an injury in fact, particularly with respect to the Association.",
        "district_court_decision":"On December 21, 2023, the district court (Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV) denied the plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Preliminary Injunction. Applying the preliminary injunction standard used in the First Circuit, the court assessed (1) the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits, (2) the likelihood of irreparable harm absent an injunction, (3) the balance of hardships, and (4) the public interest. The court treated likelihood of success on the merits as a necessary condition. Focusing on the Second Amendment issues under the framework articulated by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller and New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the district court framed the core question as whether Massachusetts\u2019s restrictions on assault weapons and LCMs are consistent with the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation, particularly the historical tradition of regulating \"dangerous and unusual\" weapons.\n\nAs to assault weapons, the district court assumed, without deciding, that the weapons proscribed by the Act are \"bearable arms\" falling somewhere within the scope of the Second Amendment. The court then found, based on the record before it, that the banned assault weapons, including the Colt AR\u201115, are \"dangerous and unusual\" in the sense that they are unreasonably dangerous and unusual for ordinary citizens to use for lawful purposes such as self\u2011defense. The court emphasized the design and features of the AR\u201115, finding that the intrinsic characteristics of assault weapons make them poor self-defense weapons compared to typical semiautomatic handguns and that the injuries they inflict can be catastrophic and far exceed the destructive power of such handguns. The court acknowledged that an AR\u201115 could be useful in some self-defense scenarios but regarded that as comparable to the potential self-defense utility of other powerful weaponry, such as machine guns or automatic grenade launchers, which have historically been subject to regulation. On that basis, the court concluded that the assault-weapon prohibition is consistent with historical traditions of regulating dangerous and unusual weapons.\n\nRegarding large capacity feeding devices, the district court noted an absence of specific guidance from the Supreme Court or the First Circuit on whether magazines constitute \"arms\" for Second Amendment purposes. Instead of resolving that question directly, the court identified historical analogues, including founding-era restrictions on the storage and use of gunpowder and early twentieth-century bans or restrictions addressing high-capacity magazines and similar devices, and concluded that there is a historical tradition supporting regulation of devices analogous to LCMs. The court did not explicitly find that LCMs themselves were \"dangerous and unusual\" in the same manner as assault weapons but determined that the historical record of regulation, including both powder storage laws and early magazine restrictions, supported the constitutionality of the LCM provisions.\n\nSynthesizing these conclusions, the district court held that the Massachusetts Ban was likely consistent with the Second Amendment and determined that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of either their assault-weapon challenge or their LCM challenge. Finding this dispositive on the preliminary injunction analysis, the court denied the PI Motion without relying on the other preliminary injunction factors.",
        "what_is_appealed":"The plaintiffs filed a timely interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) from the district court\u2019s order denying their Motion for Preliminary Injunction. They challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that they failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their Second Amendment claims and, specifically, the court\u2019s determinations that (1) the Ban\u2019s restrictions on assault weapons, including the AR-15 and certain semiautomatic handguns, are consistent with the historical tradition of firearm regulation, and (2) the Ban\u2019s restrictions on large capacity feeding devices are consistent with that same historical tradition. They seek appellate review of the denial of preliminary injunctive relief and of the constitutional analysis underlying that denial. The appeal also implicates, as a threshold matter, Article III standing for each plaintiff, though the Attorney General did not press standing on appeal; the court of appeals discusses standing to confirm its own jurisdiction, focusing in particular on whether Capen and the Association have alleged sufficient injury in fact at the preliminary injunction stage."

Heller, New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, and United States v. Rahimi.

The burden then shifts to the government to justify its regulation by showing consistency with the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation. This historical-analogue inquiry looks to \"how\" and \"why\" historic regulations burdened the right to armed self-defense and compares them to the modern regulation, recognizing that analogues need not be precise historical twins.

The historical-analogue approach focuses on similarity in how and why the law burdens the right to armed self-defense. First Circuit precedent in Ocean State Tactical, LLC v. Rhode Island applied this framework to a nearly identical ban on large capacity magazines and concluded, at the preliminary injunction stage, that the historical record strongly supported the constitutionality of that type of restriction.

          "The plaintiffs contend that the Massachusetts Ban violates the Second Amendment both on its face and as applied to law-abiding adults who wish to acquire, possess, use, and transfer firearms and magazines that, they argue, are in common use by the American public for lawful purposes, including self-defense in the home. They emphasize that millions of Americans own the types of firearms and magazines targeted by the Ban, and on that basis maintain that such arms cannot be deemed \"dangerous and unusual\" and fall instead within the Second Amendment\u2019s protection.",
          "They argue that the Ban imposes a substantial burden on the right to keep and bear arms by categorically prohibiting ordinary citizens from acquiring and possessing a large class of commonly possessed semiautomatic rifles, pistols, shotguns, and magazines over ten rounds (or five shotgun shells), rather than imposing narrower regulations on use or carry. In their view, this is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Heller, which invalidated a broad prohibition on handgun possession in the home and referred to handguns as the \"quintessential\" self-defense weapon. They contend that the Massachusetts restrictions on semiautomatic handguns\u2014especially those most popular or \"preferred\" for self-defense\u2014are \"glaringly unconstitutional\" in light of Heller's statement that banning from the home the most preferred firearm for protection fails constitutional scrutiny.",

The plaintiffs maintain that the mere fact that a weapon is powerful or that it can cause severe injuries does not, by itself, place it outside the Second Amendment\u2019s scope when it is widely owned and used for lawful purposes. They similarly argue that the district court undervalued evidence of the widespread civilian ownership and lawful usage of these arms, contending that the historical tradition described in Heller does not authorize banning weapons that are currently in common lawful use.",

They assert that the Ban on magazines holding more than ten rounds (or more than five shotgun shells) interferes with self-defense by limiting the ammunition capacity available to law-abiding citizens in defensive situations. They also argue that the district court\u2019s reliance on historical analogues such as gunpowder storage laws and early twentieth-century magazine regulations is misplaced because those laws, in their view, are not sufficiently similar in how and why they burden self-defense.",

They contend that these historical restrictions were narrower, targeted weapons not commonly used for lawful self-defense, and did not impose comparably broad prohibitions on ordinary law-abiding citizens. In their view, the district court erred in treating those historical laws as adequate support for the Massachusetts Ban.",

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "The Attorney General of Massachusetts (the Commonwealth) argues that the plaintiffs lack a likelihood of success on the merits because the Ban fits comfortably within the Nation\u2019s historical tradition of regulating particularly dangerous weapons, and thus is consistent with the Second Amendment under the Bruen and Rahimi framework. The Commonwealth emphasizes that the Ban does not prohibit all firearms or even all semiautomatic firearms, but rather targets a subset of especially lethal weapons and large-capacity magazines that pose unique risks to public safety, especially in mass shooting and violent crime scenarios.",
          "The Commonwealth contends that the challenged assault weapons\u2014particularly semiautomatic rifles like the AR\u201115\u2014are not well-suited to ordinary self-defense in the home. Relying on expert declarations, the Commonwealth asserts that AR\u201115-style rifles typically require two-handed operation, are more likely to penetrate walls and common household construction materials, and thus present significant over-penetration risks in residential settings, undermining their alleged defensive advantage over handguns. The Commonwealth also points to evidence that semiautomatic rifles are rarely if ever used in actual civilian self-defense incidents, which, under the First Circuit\u2019s Ocean State Tactical decision, lessens the burden imposed on the core right of armed self-defense by their regulation.",
          "On the historical inquiry, the Commonwealth maintains that there is a longstanding tradition of regulating, and sometimes banning, specific weapons once they were recognized as posing heightened threats to public safety, regardless of whether those weapons could conceivably be used in self-defense. The Commonwealth identifies historical examples including: (a) eighteenth- and nineteenth-century regulations restricting the storage and use of gunpowder; (b) eighteenth- through twentieth-century bans on the use of \"trap guns\" (set guns); (c) nineteenth-century bans and severe restrictions on Bowie knives and other long-bladed knives viewed as associated with violent crime; (d) longstanding prohibitions on clubs and certain blunt instruments; and (e) twentieth-century bans on sawed-off shotguns and automatic weapons (machine guns). It argues that these precedents demonstrate a pattern of government regulation of arms that are unusually dangerous and associated with criminal misuse or mass harm.",
          "The Commonwealth asserts that the justification for the Massachusetts Ban\u2014protecting the public from the particular danger caused by weapons that facilitate mass casualties, especially in mass shootings\u2014is similar in kind to the justifications underlying these historical regulations. It stresses that modern semiautomatic assault weapons and LCMs enable a shooter to fire many high-velocity rounds rapidly, inflicting catastrophic injuries and casualties in a short period of time, and that legislatures have historically responded to comparable threats by restricting or banning the weapons most associated with such harms. The Commonwealth points to legislative history, including statements by then-Governor Mitt Romney at the time of the 2004 enactment making the Ban permanent, describing assault weapons as having no place in Massachusetts and as instruments of destruction whose prohibition was intended to help keep streets and neighborhoods safe and make it harder for criminals to obtain them.",
          "The Commonwealth relies heavily on the First Circuit\u2019s decision in Ocean State Tactical, which upheld the denial of preliminary relief in a challenge to Rhode Island\u2019s nearly identical LCM ban. It argues that Ocean State Tactical\u2019s reasoning\u2014that historical bans on particularly dangerous weapons and devices (including Bowie knives, sawed-off shotguns, and machine guns) are sufficiently analogous under Bruen to modern LCM bans\u2014directly applies to Massachusetts\u2019s LCM provisions. The Commonwealth also asserts that Ocean State Tactical\u2019s general conclusions about how and why the government may regulate dangerous weapons, including the court\u2019s treatment of self-defense burden and public safety justifications, are equally applicable to Massachusetts\u2019s assault weapon restrictions.",
          "With respect to determinations about what constitutes \"dangerous and unusual\" weapons, the Commonwealth supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that assault weapons covered by the Ban, such as the AR\u201115, are more dangerous and no more useful for ordinary self-defense than other available firearms, particularly handguns, which were at issue in Heller. It contends that the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on ownership statistics to establish \"common use\" is inconsistent with the First Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Heller and Bruen in Ocean State Tactical, which rejected the notion that mere prevalence in the marketplace or society is the sole measure of whether a weapon is protected, and instead focused on actual use for self-defense and the degree of harm the weapon can cause.",
          "The Commonwealth disputes the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Heller\u2019s invalidation of a total handgun ban, arguing that Heller does not preclude legislation that regulates only certain subclasses of handguns with specific military-style features or capacities. The Ban, it notes, does not prohibit possession of all handguns and allows Massachusetts residents to acquire and possess a wide array of firearms suitable for self-defense. Therefore, the Commonwealth argues, the Massachusetts Ban is far less restrictive than the law struck down in Heller and does not amount to a complete prohibition of the \"quintessential self-defense weapon.\"",
          "On the facial challenge, the Commonwealth argues that the plaintiffs cannot show that the Ban is unconstitutional in every application. It emphasizes that the Ban covers a wide variety of weapons and magazines, including models and configurations (such as UZIs, AK-type rifles, revolving cylinder shotguns, and rifles with combinations of specified features like flash suppressors and grenade launchers) that the plaintiffs do not specifically address in their arguments. Under Supreme Court precedents on facial challenges, the Commonwealth argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to demonstrate the unconstitutionality of the Ban as applied to each covered weapon or configuration is fatal to their attempt to invalidate the statute on its face.",
          "Regarding standing, the Commonwealth previously contended at the district court that the plaintiffs had not sufficiently alleged an injury in fact. In particular, it challenged the Association\u2019s associational standing because the complaint and supporting declaration did not identify any specific member who is directly affected by the Ban or who would purchase banned weapons or magazines but for credible threat of enforcement. While the Attorney General did not press the standing arguments on appeal, the Commonwealth\u2019s earlier position was that generalized assertions about unidentified members\u2019 interests are inadequate for Article III standing."

The First Circuit\u2019s own recent decision in Ocean State Tactical (upholding denial of a PI against a nearly identical LCM ban and strongly endorsing a broad view of historical regulation of particularly dangerous weapons) constrains how this panel can analyze both the historical tradition and the \u2018dangerous and unusual\u2019 framework. The district court assumed, arguendo, that the banned semiautomatic rifles and pistols are \u2018bearable arms\u2019 and then concluded, based on expert evidence and historical analogues, that they are reasonably deemed dangerous and unusual and that the ban fits within the historic tradition of regulating such weapons. That is a plausible reading of Bruen\u2019s historical-analogue method and tracks Ocean State Tactical\u2019s acceptance of analogous regulations on high\u2011lethality arms. Given the predictive nature of a PI ruling and the heavy weight the First Circuit places on likelihood of success, the panel will not find an abuse of discretion in concluding that plaintiffs have not shown a sufficient likelihood of success regarding the assault\u2011weapon prohibition at this preliminary stage."

Under the law\u2011of\u2011the\u2011circuit doctrine, this panel is bound absent intervening Supreme Court authority (none is identified that undermines Ocean State Tactical). The district court\u2019s historical-analogue analysis\u2014relying on gunpowder storage laws and early magazine restrictions as evidence of a tradition of regulating especially dangerous means of rapid fire\u2014mirrors the reasoning approved in Ocean State Tactical. To the extent plaintiffs argue that magazines are themselves \u2018arms\u2019 or that prevalence or ownership numbers should control, those positions were effectively rejected in Ocean State Tactical at the PI stage.

          "reasoning":"Whether a facial challenge is viable is a question of law reviewed de novo. Under Salerno, Bucklew, Rahimi, and related authority, a facial challenge generally requires showing that the statute is unconstitutional in all its applications. The Massachusetts Ban covers a wide array of weapons and configurations, including some (e.g., UZIs, AK\u2011type rifles, revolving cylinder shotguns, rifles with grenade launchers) that plaintiffs barely discuss and that have particularly strong analogues in historical restrictions on especially dangerous or military\u2011style arms. Ocean State Tactical also emphasizes that limited or partial burdens on the core self\u2011defense right weaken facial challenges. Plaintiffs largely focus on AR\u201115s and certain semiautomatic handguns; they do not meaningfully demonstrate that every application of the Ban\u2014including to the most exotic or clearly crime\u2011associated configurations\u2014is unconstitutional. Under the disfavor for facial challenges and the requirement to consider whether the law has at least some constitutional applications, plaintiffs have not shown a sufficient likelihood of success on their facial challenge, and the district court\u2019s implicit rejection of that theory will be sustained."

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"Article III standing is reviewed de novo. Capen, an identified individual who alleges that he would purchase banned firearms and magazines but for a credible threat of prosecution, satisfies injury in fact, causation, and redressability at the PI stage; this is consistent with Draper v. Healey and similar pre\u2011enforcement Second Amendment cases. Even if the Association\u2019s associational standing is defective for failure to name a specific affected member (as suggested by Summers and Hochendoner), the presence of at least one plaintiff (Capen) with standing is sufficient for jurisdiction and for review of the denial of a PI. The Attorney General does not press standing on appeal, and the court of appeals will typically decline to dismiss on these facts where one plaintiff clearly meets Article III requirements. Thus, to the extent the district court implicitly treated standing as adequate to reach the merits, that conclusion will be affirmed; the Association\u2019s standing issues, if noted, will be treated as non\u2011dispositive because Capen\u2019s standing supports the case."

          "reasoning":"The First Circuit repeatedly holds that likelihood of success on the merits is a \u2018necessary\u2019 or \u2018critical\u2019 element of preliminary injunction analysis; if that factor is not satisfied, courts may deny a PI without detailed analysis of the remaining factors. The district court expressly followed this approach, treating likelihood of success as dispositive. That is consistent with First Circuit precedent such as Corp. Techs., Akebia Therapeutics, and Narragansett Indian Tribe. Because the district court applied the correct legal framework and made a reasonable predictive judgment\u2014grounded in the existing record and in historical\u2011tradition analysis aligned with Ocean State Tactical and Heller\/Bruen\u2014that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their Second Amendment claims, it did not abuse its discretion in denying the PI solely on that basis."

      "overall_outcome":"AFFIRM",
      "confidence":0.8,
      "reasoning":"The appeal concerns only the denial of preliminary injunctive relief, not a final merits judgment. The First Circuit gives substantial deference to district courts\u2019 predictive assessments at the PI stage, particularly on complex historical and constitutional questions. On the core Second Amendment issues, the panel is constrained by its own recent, on\u2011point decision in Ocean State Tactical, which upheld denial of a PI against a nearly identical LCM ban and endorsed viewing high\u2011lethality weapons and magazines as subject to a historical tradition of regulation. That precedent strongly supports affirmance on Issue 2 and, by extension, bolsters the district court\u2019s general approach to the \u2018dangerous and unusual\u2019 and historical\u2011analogue framework for Issue 1. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that widespread ownership alone controls \u2018common use,\u2019 and that policy concerns may not inform historical analogies, are in practical tension with Ocean State Tactical\u2019s reasoning. The facial challenge (Issue 3) is unusually broad and does not satisfy the demanding requirement of showing invalidity in all applications, especially given the Ban\u2019s coverage of particularly extreme weapon types. On standing (Issue 4), at least one plaintiff, Capen, clearly alleges a concrete pre\u2011enforcement injury; even if associational standing for the organization is questionable, that does not defeat jurisdiction. Finally, the district court correctly treated likelihood of success as a necessary condition for a preliminary injunction (Issue 5) and acted within the accepted range of discretion in denying relief based solely on that factor. Taken together, these considerations make a full affirmance of the district court\u2019s order the most likely appellate outcome."

      "factual_background":"IQ Data International, Inc. acquired a debt obligation arising from Six\u2019s purported breach of a residential lease. On August 18, 2021, Six became aware of this debt and mailed a letter to Equifax disputing the debt and requesting documentation to verify it. That same day, Six\u2019s attorney mailed a separate letter directly to IQ. The attorney\u2019s letter informed IQ that Six was represented by counsel and directed that all communications regarding the debt be sent to the attorney rather than to Six personally. On September 2, 2021, IQ received Six\u2019s dispute letter (the one addressed to Equifax) and internally processed a request to generate and mail the requested verification documentation to Six at his mailing address. On September 3, 2021, IQ updated its internal records to reflect that it had processed the attorney\u2019s representation letter and that direct communications with Six should cease. However, on that same day, IQ also sent a debt verification letter, containing documentation of the debt, directly to Six at his mailing address. Six later alleged that receipt of this letter, after IQ had been notified that he was represented by counsel and that communications should go only to his attorney, invaded his privacy interests.",

The case also involved issues concerning IQ\u2019s affirmative defenses, a joint discovery dispute implicating attorney-client privilege, and a request for attorneys\u2019 fees.",

The district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Six did not have Article III standing. The court determined that Six had not suffered an injury in fact, reasoning that the receipt of a single unwanted letter was not sufficiently analogous to traditionally recognized harms that support a lawsuit and was not the type of abusive debt collection practice that the FDCPA was enacted to prevent. On that basis, the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction and denied the remaining portions of the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment as moot. Separately (as referenced by the court of appeals), the district court resolved a joint discovery dispute involving attorney-client privilege and entered a modified grant of attorneys\u2019 fees.",

Thus, receiving the letter is the type of harm Congress intended to make legally cognizable.",

Under Spokeo and TransUnion, courts look to (1) Congress\u2019s judgment in identifying and elevating a harm and (2) whether the alleged injury bears a close relationship to a traditionally recognized harm. Congress expressly framed the FDCPA, and \u00a7 1692c(a)(2) in particular, as protecting consumers\u2019 privacy from abusive collection practices, including unwanted direct contact with represented debtors. Six alleges that, after he clearly directed IQ (through counsel) not to contact him directly, IQ knowingly sent him a debt-collection verification letter anyway. That is a particularized invasion of privacy, not a bare procedural error.\n\nNinth Circuit precedent treats unwanted targeted communications\u2014such as harassing calls or texts\u2014as sufficiently analogous to intrusion upon seclusion to support concreteness; here, the panel would likely view an unwanted debt-collection letter sent in knowing disregard of a representation notice as similar in kind, especially in light of Congress\u2019s specific judgment in \u00a7 1692c(a)(2). The district court\u2019s view that a single letter is categorically too trivial conflicts with that framework. The traceability and redressability elements are not meaningfully disputed.

The summary provides no indication that the challenged affirmative defenses were legally impossible or patently frivolous, only that Six believed they were inapplicable on the merits.

The excerpt shows only that the district court resolved a joint discovery dispute by upholding an assertion of attorney\u2013client privilege. There is no indication that the court misapplied the basic privilege standard (confidential communications for the purpose of obtaining legal advice) or any waiver rule, nor that it compelled or denied discovery in a way that materially distorted the adversarial process. In the absence of a clear misapplication of law or a plainly erroneous factual finding, the court of appeals would almost certainly defer to the district court\u2019s handling of the privilege dispute."

Nothing in the summary indicates that the court applied an incorrect legal standard under the FDCPA\u2019s fee-shifting provisions, or that the amount awarded (or denied) was outside the range of acceptable outcomes.

Given Congress\u2019s explicit focus on privacy invasions in the FDCPA, the specific prohibition on contacting represented consumers, and modern standing doctrine\u2019s acceptance of unwanted targeted communications as concrete intangible harms, the appellate court is likely to reject the district court\u2019s categorical conclusion that one such letter is too minor to support standing. That yields reversal on Issue 1 and a remand for further proceedings on the FDCPA claim.\n\nBy contrast, the remaining issues (motion to strike defenses, discovery\/privilege, and fees) lie squarely within the district court\u2019s discretionary and fact-intensive domains. The summary reveals no clear legal missteps or extreme outcomes in any of those rulings. Under abuse-of-discretion and clear-error standards, appellate courts rarely intervene absent a strong signal of error, which is missing here. Thus, the most plausible overall disposition is mixed: reverse the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, affirm the court\u2019s ancillary procedural and fee rulings, and remand for continued litigation on the merits of Six\u2019s FDCPA claim."

It was constructed using pre-engineered steel framing, with moment frames running north-to-south and cable cross bracing running east-to-west.

Concrete pedestals extended from underlying spread footings to support load-bearing interior columns. In the West Building, the moment frames were supported by three I-beam columns attached to the foundation's footing pedestals with steel plates and anchor bolts. In the East Building, the moment frames were supported by hollow steel beams set directly into the foundation.\n\nOn March 30, 2022, a tornado struck and destroyed the Building. All 100,000 square feet of the West Building and approximately 40,000 square feet of the East Building collapsed. The wall panels and roof of the remaining portion of the East Building were damaged beyond repair, but much of the interior moment framing and roof supports in that remaining portion were largely undamaged. The East Building's foundation, however, suffered damage, including sheared base plates and anchor bolts, a cracked floor slab, and spalled concrete along the perimeter. Given the extent of the destruction and damage, Nilfisk vacated the premises on August 1, 2022, before the Lease term expired.\n\nUnder the Lease, Nilfisk was responsible for all property-related expenses, including taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs. Section 10.2 of the Lease required Nilfisk, as tenant, to purchase and maintain an \"all-risk\" commercial property insurance policy covering the improvements on the premises (excluding Nilfisk's own property) against specified perils, including windstorm, and any other risks covered by a causes-of-loss special form policy. The coverage amount had to be equal to 100% of the then full replacement cost of the premises, subject to a deductible not exceeding $100,000. \"Full replacement cost\" was defined in the Lease as the cost of replacing the premises without deduction for depreciation or wear and tear, less the cost of footings, foundations, and other structures below grade.\n\nThe Lease gave Fort Worth Partners certain remedies if Nilfisk failed to comply with the insurance requirements. Section 10.1 permitted Fort Worth Partners, after at least five days' prior written notice, to order the required insurance itself and charge the cost to Nilfisk as additional rent, payable on demand. Alternatively, if Nilfisk failed to perform its obligations, Fort Worth Partners could terminate the tenancy and recover \"any ... amount necessary to compensate ... for all the detriment directly caused\" by Nilfisk's nonperformance.\n\nNeither party undertook to determine the Building's full replacement cost during the Lease term. The Building's appraised value ranged between approximately $10.5 million and $11.1 million. Nilfisk's property insurance limits varied by year; it never carried more than $10 million in full replacement cost coverage, and at the time of the tornado Nilfisk carried $5,149,999 in full replacement cost property insurance. Fort Worth Partners received annual certificates of insurance from Nilfisk reflecting the coverage limits and did not object to or question the sufficiency of the coverage. Fort Worth Partners was aware of its contractual right to purchase additional full replacement cost coverage and pass the cost to Nilfisk as additional rent, but did not exercise that right.\n\nFollowing the tornado, Fort Worth Partners claimed that Nilfisk had failed to maintain the contractually required full replacement cost insurance and sought to recover the amount it contended it would have received had Nilfisk complied with its insurance obligation. During discovery, both sides retained experts to estimate the Building's full replacement cost. Fort Worth Partners' expert, Kevin McMahon, estimated full replacement cost at $27,722,974.03. Nilfisk's expert, Jeff Marcussen, estimated full replacement cost at $14,253,579. Nilfisk's insurer retained a separate appraiser who estimated the replacement cost at $9,428,939.87. Nilfisk paid Fort Worth Partners $5,292,427.32 in insurance proceeds, which the district court later deducted from its calculation of replacement cost damages.\n\nIn the damages phase, the district court ultimately found the full replacement cost of the Building, net of insurance proceeds, to be $12,870,528.74, including specific components such as $732,000 for demolition, $7,138,611.89 for rebuilding the metal superstructure, $2,982,112.75 for electrical wiring, $1,651,177.82 in overhead and lost profits, and $5,659,053.60 in certain costs the court characterized as \"unrebutted\" from McMahon's estimate. The court separately found the cost of repairing the foundation to be $1,303,123 but concluded those foundation damages were not recoverable under the Lease because of the exclusion of footings, foundations, and other below-grade structures from the full replacement cost definition.\n\nAfter trial, Fort Worth Partners sought $170,413.50 in attorney's fees and $19,059.65 in costs. The court reduced the requested fees to $152,115 to align with local prevailing rates, and then applied a further 25% reduction to $114,086.25 on the ground that Fort Worth Partners achieved only limited success relative to the damages it sought. The court awarded $5,149.15 in costs.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Fort Worth Partners filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas (Fayetteville Division) against Nilfisk, Inc. and its parent company Nilfisk Holding A\/S. The complaint alleged breach of contract based on Nilfisk's alleged failure to maintain property insurance in the amount and form required by Section 10.2 of the Lease. Fort Worth Partners sought damages representing the full replacement cost of the Building that it asserted would have been covered had Nilfisk maintained adequate insurance, as well as unpaid rent and related monetary relief.",
        "district_court_decision":"The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Fort Worth Partners argued that Nilfisk had breached the Lease as a matter of law by failing to carry insurance equal to 100% of the Building's full replacement cost. Nilfisk opposed and, in its own summary judgment motion, argued that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations and Arkansas's doctrine of avoidable consequences, that the insurance provision of the Lease was an unenforceable agreement to agree, and that the damages sought were excessive.\n\nThe district court granted Fort Worth Partners' summary judgment motion in part. Using even the lowest of the replacement-cost estimates in the record (the appraiser retained by Nilfisk's insurer), the court concluded that Nilfisk's coverage at the time of the tornado was below the amount required by Section 10.2 of the Lease and held that Nilfisk had breached its insurance obligation and was liable for resulting damages. The court declined, however, to fix the Building's precise replacement cost at summary judgment due to conflicting expert opinions and set that issue for a bench trial. The court also awarded Fort Worth Partners summary judgment on its unpaid rent claim, which neither party appealed.\n\nThe court denied Nilfisk's summary judgment motion in its entirety. It held that Fort Worth Partners' suit was timely because each deficient annual insurance policy and certificate could constitute a separate breach with its own limitations period; it found fact questions concerning the application of the doctrine of avoidable consequences; it rejected Nilfisk's contention that the insurance provision was an unenforceable agreement to agree; and it found that Fort Worth Partners' claimed damages were not facially excessive at the summary judgment stage.\n\nThe court then conducted a bench trial limited to damages. Both parties presented expert testimony on the Building's full replacement cost, including detailed categories for demolition, reconstruction of the metal superstructure, electrical systems, overhead, and other costs. After weighing the evidence, the district court issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court determined that the full replacement cost damages, net of the insurance proceeds already paid, totaled $12,870,528.74, broken down into several categories. The court specifically excluded $1,303,123 in foundation-related repair costs from the award based on its interpretation of the Lease's exclusion of footings, foundations, and below-grade structures from the definition of full replacement cost.\n\nDuring the trial, Nilfisk did not present evidence in support of its earlier summary judgment argument that the doctrine of avoidable consequences barred or reduced Fort Worth Partners' damages. Instead, Nilfisk stated in its post-trial brief that it adopted and incorporated by reference its earlier summary judgment arguments and authorities concerning that doctrine. The district court rejected that approach, noting that Nilfisk had not offered evidence or re-urged the issue at trial, and it declined to apply the doctrine of avoidable consequences for the reasons previously expressed in its summary judgment order.\n\nFollowing the damages decision, the district court ruled on Fort Worth Partners' motion for attorney's fees and costs. It reduced the requested attorney's fees to match prevailing local rates and then imposed a further 25% reduction due to Fort Worth Partners' partial or limited success on its damages theories. It awarded a reduced amount of attorney's fees and a portion of the requested costs.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Nilfisk appealed (No. 24-3224) the district court's denial of its motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations and avoidable-consequences grounds and challenged the district court's damages award, particularly the portion labeled as 'unrebutted costs.' Fort Worth Partners cross-appealed (No. 24-3281), challenging the district court's interpretation of the Lease as excluding all foundation damages, its conclusion that the Lease allowed only a repair remedy for the foundation (an issue the district court did not reach after its exclusion determination), and the reduction of attorney's fees based on Fort Worth Partners' perceived limited success."

According to Nilfisk, the statute of limitations began running at that time and expired before Fort Worth Partners filed suit, thereby barring any claim based on Nilfisk's failure to maintain full replacement cost insurance.",
          "Nilfisk contends that the doctrine of avoidable consequences precludes or reduces Fort Worth Partners' recovery because Fort Worth Partners could have protected itself by exercising its contractual right to purchase additional full replacement cost insurance and charge the costs to Nilfisk as additional rent. Nilfisk maintains that Fort Worth Partners unreasonably failed to mitigate its damages by not invoking this option despite receiving annual certificates of insurance showing coverage below what Fort Worth Partners now claims was required.",
          "Nilfisk asserts that the district court's award of approximately $5.66 million in 'unrebutted costs' is unsupported by the record because its expert, Jeff Marcussen, in fact addressed and rebutted each of the categories of damages that Fort Worth Partners' expert, Kevin McMahon, identified. Nilfisk contends there were no truly unrebutted line items and that the district court failed to provide sufficiently detailed factual findings to justify that segment of the award.",
          "In response to Fort Worth Partners' cross-appeal on foundation damages, Nilfisk maintains that Section 10.2 of the Lease excludes the entire cost of footings and foundations, whether above or below ground level, as well as other below-grade structures, from the definition of 'Full Replacement Cost.' Under Nilfisk's reading, Fort Worth Partners cannot recover any damages for damage to the foundation because the contract expressly carves out that category of costs.",

Nilfisk points out that Fort Worth Partners sought significantly more in damages than it ultimately recovered, and it argues that the 25% reduction appropriately accounts for Fort Worth Partners' limited success on its damages theories."

Fort Worth Partners maintains that, at minimum, its claim based on the 2021 policy in effect when the 2022 tornado destroyed the Building accrued in 2021 and was timely filed within five years.",
          "On the doctrine of avoidable consequences, Fort Worth Partners argues that Nilfisk waived the issue on appeal by not developing it at trial. Fort Worth Partners notes that Nilfisk did not present trial evidence or argument on mitigation and instead merely incorporated by reference its summary judgment briefing in a post-trial filing. Substantively, Fort Worth Partners contends that the doctrine does not apply because it had no obligation to cure Nilfisk's own breach by purchasing additional insurance and that any requirement to do so would entail more than 'small expense' or 'reasonable exertion' as contemplated by Arkansas mitigation law.",

          "On foundation damages, Fort Worth Partners argues on cross-appeal that the Lease's phrase 'less the cost of footings, foundations and other structures below grade' excludes only the below-grade portions of the foundation and footings from the full replacement cost calculation. Fort Worth Partners maintains that above-grade portions of the foundation and related components should be included in the recoverable full replacement cost, and it disputes the district court's interpretation that precluded any recovery for foundation damage.",

That does not preserve a factbound mitigation defense or supply a trial record for the court to rely on. The district court expressly noted the absence of trial evidence and declined to apply avoidable consequences, while also reiterating its earlier legal analysis rejecting the theory.

Under Eighth Circuit precedent (Lesch, Kingman, IPSCO, Stephenson), a bench-trial damages award must be supported by specific findings that allow review and must rest on evidence actually in the record, not on a mistaken belief that portions were unrebutted. Here the district court neither identified the precise line items nor reconciled the competing expert opinions, and it premised this large component on an inaccurate description of the evidentiary posture.

The district court construed the phrase to bar all foundation-related damages, including above-grade portions. That reading effectively reads \u2018below grade\u2019 out of the clause and is not compelled by the text; \u2018foundations\u2019 naturally describes the entire assembly, which is then limited by \u2018other structures below grade.\u2019 Fort Worth Partners\u2019 reading\u2014that only below-grade components are excluded, and above-grade foundation damage remains within \u2018full replacement cost\u2019\u2014better harmonizes the words used. On de novo review, the district court\u2019s categorical exclusion of all foundation costs is an erroneous interpretation; at minimum, recoverable damages must be reconsidered to include above-grade foundation damage (subject to the separate question whether the lease affords repair versus full replacement for that portion).

Under Marshall and similar authority, district courts have broad discretion to adjust fees for results obtained, and proportionality to damages is not required but may be considered. A 25% reduction in a case where the plaintiff prevailed on liability but recovered materially less than it sought falls well within the permissible range.

      "reasoning":"On the liability and defenses issues (limitations and mitigation), Arkansas law and the trial record favor Fort Worth Partners; the district court correctly recognized a recurring contractual duty to maintain adequate insurance and properly rejected a mitigation theory that Nilfisk neither proved at trial nor grounded in Arkansas\u2019s avoidable-consequences doctrine. Those rulings are likely to be affirmed. The attorney\u2019s fees reduction is reviewed deferentially and is modest, reasoned, and tied to the degree of success; that, too, is unlikely to be disturbed. By contrast, the damages determinations are more vulnerable. The district court\u2019s reliance on a large block of \u2018unrebutted\u2019 costs is undermined both by Nilfisk\u2019s record-based challenge and Fort Worth Partners\u2019 concession that the label is inaccurate. Eighth Circuit precedent is strict about requiring specific, evidence-based findings in bench-trial damages awards; this portion will likely be vacated and remanded for clarification and recalculation. On cross-appeal, the lease language about \u2018footings, foundations and other structures below grade\u2019 most reasonably excludes only below-grade costs, not all foundation-related damage. The district court\u2019s contrary categorical exclusion misreads the limiting phrase \u2018below grade\u2019 and thus is apt to be reversed, with a remand for allocation between excluded below-grade and included above-grade costs and for consideration of the contractually appropriate remedy. The combination\u2014affirmance on issues 1, 2, and 5, with reversal and remand on issues 3 and 4\u2014yields a mixed overall outcome."

      },
      "factual_background":"Steven Bernitz has a long history of back and hip problems and multiple surgeries dating back to 1999. In December 2013, he began working for Synta Pharmaceuticals as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. Through his employment, he was covered by a long\u2011term disability insurance plan issued and administered by USAble Life (the \"Plan\").\n\nThe Plan defines \"disability\" as an injury, sickness, or pregnancy that requires the claimant to be under the regular care of a physician and \"prevents you from performing at least one of the material duties of your regular occupation with reasonable accommodations.\" It further states that if the claimant can perform the material duties of the regular occupation with reasonable accommodations, they will not be considered disabled. A \"material duty\" is defined as the set of tasks or skills generally required by employers for that occupation and expressly includes the ability to work full\u2011time as defined in the policy. The Plan requires beneficiaries to provide prompt proof of continuing disability upon request, including a wide range of medical, employment, and financial records, and permits USAble to require independent medical examinations and interviews. Failure to provide continuing proof and necessary authorizations can result in nonpayment of benefits. The Plan grants USAble sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility and interpret policy terms.\n\nIn June 2014, due to chronic back pain, Bernitz stopped working at Synta. He submitted a long\u2011term disability claim to USAble in October 2014. After investigation, USAble approved the claim in March 2015 and then paid monthly disability benefits for approximately five years. During the benefit period, USAble periodically verified his continued eligibility by sending questionnaires about activities of daily living, obtaining Attending Physician\u2019s Statements from his doctors, and monitoring public records and social media.\n\nIn December 2014, shortly after his Plan claim, Bernitz applied for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). After initial denials, his SSDI claim was heard before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in June 2018. The ALJ issued a written decision denying benefits, citing record evidence that Bernitz was taking college classes, driving, taking walks up to half a mile, cooking, taking out the trash, exercising regularly with a personal trainer, traveling to Hawaii and national parks in the Southwest, and spending about a month in San Diego house\u2011hunting. The ALJ found those activities inconsistent with his statements about the intensity and limiting effects of his symptoms. The Social Security Appeals Council affirmed that decision in August 2019.\n\nWhile the SSDI claim was pending, USAble continued collecting and reviewing medical records. In May 2017, Bernitz\u2019s pain management specialist, Dr. Yogesh Patel, submitted an Attending Physician\u2019s Statement indicating that Bernitz took gabapentin for pain, should not sit more than one to two hours at a time, should not stand more than thirty minutes at a time, and should avoid repetitive lifting. Dr. Patel described the condition as permanent and irreversible and reported that surgery had resulted in only minor symptom improvement, and that medication side effects made prolonged concentration very difficult or impossible. In a January 2019 Back Disorders Questionnaire, Dr. Patel stated he believed Bernitz would never return to the workforce, full\u2011time or part\u2011time.\n\nUSAble retained its own reviewing physician, Dr. Stewart Russell, to review Bernitz\u2019s file. In October 2017, after reviewing records from twenty\u2011one doctors, Dr. Russell opined that, given Bernitz\u2019s pain complaints, multiple low\u2011back surgeries, osteoarthritis in both knees, and prior shoulder decompression surgery, he did not have the capacity to perform full\u2011time sedentary or light work.\n\nAfter learning that the Social Security claim had been denied, USAble sought updated records from Dr. Patel, from endocrinologist Dr. Ken Fujioka, and from primary care physician Dr. Biraj Shah. Those records reflected what USAble viewed as significant improvements in Bernitz\u2019s condition. A January 2018 office note from Dr. Shah stated that Bernitz was preparing for a ten\u2011day trip to Baja, Mexico and recorded his weight at 288 pounds. An April 2018 note from Dr. Patel reported that Bernitz requested knee injections for an upcoming trip from California to Boston and listed his weight at 275 pounds. An August 2018 note from Dr. Shah recorded his weight at 263 pounds, attributed to steady exercise, and noted that he had stopped taking gabapentin and was playing pickleball and walking six days a week, up to an hour at a time. In March 2019, Dr. Shah saw him for a travel consultation for a two\u2011week safari to Africa and recorded his weight at 231 pounds. In April 2019, Dr. Patel noted that Bernitz reported substantial relief and improved function with pain medications and reported a weight loss of about 70 pounds and resolution of some other health issues.\n\nBased on what it saw as discrepancies between these activities and earlier disability evidence, USAble arranged surveillance of Bernitz in July, September, and November 2019. The surveillance documented him walking and getting in and out of and driving his car without visible pain behavior or gait abnormalities, and going to a gym to work with a personal trainer, including use of a treadmill, lifting barbells, and using a weight machine.\n\nUSAble then obtained another review from Dr. Russell, who in October 2019 reviewed updated records from ten of Bernitz\u2019s doctors. Dr. Russell noted that Bernitz had lost a significant amount of weight, which he believed decompressed the low back and allowed increased activity, and changed his prior opinion, concluding that Bernitz was no longer impaired from performing a full\u2011time light physical\u2011demand occupation. He also noted Bernitz\u2019s travel to Boston, Florida, Michigan, Mexico, and Africa in 2018 and 2019. After a follow\u2011up review in December 2019, including records relating to a September 2019 hip surgery, Dr. Russell maintained that conclusion.\n\nIn December 2019, USAble sent a letter terminating Bernitz\u2019s long\u2011term disability benefits. USAble stated that although he continued to suffer from chronic pain due to failed back surgeries, his activity level had significantly increased since 2018, citing weight loss of approximately 70 pounds, regular exercise, walking six days per week, attempts to play pickleball, working with a personal trainer three days per week for an hour involving aerobic and resistance training, travel within and outside the United States including a two\u2011week African safari, and volunteer work serving on multiple boards of directors.\n\nIn May 2020, Bernitz appealed USAble\u2019s termination decision internally. He submitted advocacy letters from Dr. Fujioka and acupuncturist Dr. Michael White, personal statements from himself and his wife, and a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) from occupational therapist Barbara Tourtellott. In a letter, Dr. Fujioka clarified earlier records about pickleball, stating that Bernitz had taken a few lessons and attempted to play again once but was unable to continue due to back pain, and suggested any prior notation that he played regularly might have reflected a misunderstanding. Some of Dr. Fujioka\u2019s visit notes from 2018 and 2019, however, had documented that Bernitz had started playing pickleball on off days.\n\nUSAble assigned the appeal to senior appeals consultant Sandra Kaserman. USAble retained Dr. Richard Maguire to review updated records. In October 2020, Dr. Maguire reported that the FCE contained inconsistencies and omissions, and, in light of conflicting information in the file and recent surgeries, recommended that Bernitz undergo an independent medical examination (IME). Bernitz declined an IME, citing COVID\u201119 concerns. Kaserman instead chose to collect additional records and have a third\u2011party vendor select another physician to perform a paper review.\n\nThe vendor selected Dr. Richard Kaplan, a board\u2011certified pain medicine specialist, who issued a report in December 2020. Dr. Kaplan identified the same issues with the FCE and concluded that there were numerous inconsistencies in the medical records and in Bernitz\u2019s statements, and that impairment was not supported. He opined that Bernitz was capable of an increased level of activity and that such activity would likely be therapeutic.\n\nIn March 2021, Bernitz asked USAble to defer a final decision because he had been referred for neuropsychological testing. Between July and September 2021, Kaserman sent him addendum reports by Drs. Maguire and Kaplan, both reaffirming their earlier conclusions even after reviewing records related to additional back surgery in summer 2021.\n\nIn October 2021, Bernitz submitted more evidence, including a vocational assessment by consultant Michael LaRaia and a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. Kaaren Bekken. LaRaia reported that, in his view, Bernitz remained vocationally unemployable. Dr. Bekken reported finding significant cognitive impairment and concluded that Bernitz was incapacitated from his own occupation.\n\nKaserman then asked a third\u2011party vendor to assign a physician to review Dr. Bekken\u2019s neuropsychological report. The vendor selected Dr. Malcolm Spica, who in October 2021 concluded that Dr. Bekken had interpreted average neuropsychological test scores as indicative of impairment without providing supporting evidence. In February 2022, Dr. Kaplan issued another review based on newly updated records, again concluding that Bernitz was not impaired. Kaserman sent these reports to Bernitz in February 2022 and requested a response within 21 days.\n\nReceiving no response within that period, USAble sent a termination letter on March 9, 2022 reaffirming its denial of ongoing benefits. That same day, Bernitz submitted a letter responding to the Kaplan and Spica reports and an additional letter from Dr. Bekken.\n\nUSAble later agreed, in August 2022, to conduct a voluntary review of the materials submitted on March 9, 2022. This led to several further written exchanges among Drs. Spica, Kaplan, and Bekken critiquing each other\u2019s positions, but none of the physicians changed their ultimate opinions. In February 2023, USAble issued its final determination letter denying Bernitz\u2019s claim for long\u2011term disability benefits under the Plan.",

          "He lists multiple case\u2011specific factors that he believes the district court failed to properly weigh, including: (a) the Plan\u2019s allegedly narrow definition of disability, which he claims USAble applied in a way that increased the likelihood of termination; (b) the Plan\u2019s internal guidance requiring USAble to explain disagreements with his experts, which he claims was not followed; (c) USAble\u2019s alleged emphasis on its own consultants\u2019 opinions while those consultants supposedly failed to engage meaningfully with the relevant evidence and the Plan\u2019s disability standard; (d) what he characterizes as USAble\u2019s selective review of contrary medical and vocational evidence, including reports from his treating physicians, FCE provider, vocational consultant, and neuropsychologist; (e) alleged misinterpretation or misuse by USAble and the district court of the Social Security Administration\u2019s denial of SSDI benefits; and (f) USAble\u2019s reliance on his weight loss, exercise, and travel, which he asserts were consistent with attempts at self\u2011care and pain management, not proof of occupational capacity.",
          "He argues that USAble did not properly apply the Plan\u2019s disability definition to his actual occupational duties.

He asserts that the independent physician reviewers were not given or did not properly consider the Plan\u2019s disability definition and vocational demands.",

The structural conflict from USAble\u2019s dual role must be considered under Glenn, but is a factor, not a separate standard. The record shows mitigating steps: use of third\u2011party vendors to select physicians, separate appeals personnel, continued payment under reservation of rights while further review occurred, and no evidence of a history of biased claims administration. Courts in the First Circuit tend to give such conflicts limited weight absent concrete indicia of skewed decisionmaking. Here USAble paid benefits for about five years before terminating, repeatedly re\u2011referred the file for updated review, and even conducted a voluntary post\u2011denial review of the late\u2011submitted materials. Those features cut against a finding that the conflict drove the result. Given substantial contrary evidence of improved function (weight loss, cessation of some pain meds, regular exercise, gym activity under surveillance, extensive travel, activities documented in medical records and the SSDI decision), the district court could reasonably conclude that any conflict did not render the termination arbitrary. Under deferential review of the administrator and de novo review of the district court\u2019s legal framework, the appellate court is likely to hold that the conflict was properly weighed and does not justify reversal."

USAble\u2019s interpretation of \u201cmaterial duties\u201d and disability (inability to perform at least one material duty of the regular occupation, including full\u2011time work, even with reasonable accommodations) is facially consistent with the written Plan. The record indicates USAble obtained a vocational assessment of the physical and cognitive demands (frequent sitting with positional changes, keyboarding, light lifting, some standing\/walking and travel) and gave those descriptions to its reviewing physicians. The consultants\u2019 reports, as summarized, evaluate whether Bernitz could sustain at least light\/sedentary work full\u2011time, which maps onto the Plan\u2019s definition and the described job demands. That is a paradigmatically reasonable application under Firestone and First Circuit precedent. On the asserted procedural requirement to explain disagreements with treating and vocational experts: ERISA regulations and the Plan do require some explanation, but USAble\u2019s letters discussed why it found treating providers\u2019 \u201cnever work again\u201d conclusions unsupported in light of extensive records showing improved capabilities, daily activities, and inconsistent FCE\/neuropsych interpretations. The fact that USAble did not credit those experts does not itself show misapplication of Plan terms, and ERISA does not impose a treating\u2011physician rule. The explanations here\u2014conflicts, inconsistencies, and reliance on other experts\u2014are within the range the First Circuit has previously deemed adequate. The district court therefore had a sound basis to find that USAble acted in accordance with the Plan and governing regulations."

          "reasoning":"Under First Circuit ERISA law, the administrator\u2019s factual disability determination is upheld if supported by substantial evidence, even where the record would also support a contrary finding and includes strong treating\u2011physician support. Here, the file contains both pro\u2011 and anti\u2011disability evidence: multiple treating sources opining permanent disability, an FCE and vocational report in his favor, and a neuropsychological evaluation finding cognitive impairment. On the other side are (1) extensive treating\u2011physician notes documenting substantial weight loss, discontinuation of some pain meds, regular exercise (including gym and walking six days per week), and ambitious domestic\/international travel; (2) surveillance demonstrating functional mobility and sustained gym\u2011based aerobic and resistance training without evident pain behavior; (3) the SSDI ALJ\u2019s denial citing similar activities as inconsistent with claimed severe limitations; and (4) several independent medical file reviews (Russell\u2019s later opinions, Maguire, Kaplan, and Spica) concluding that the objective and functional evidence did not support an inability to perform full\u2011time light\/sedentary work or that the neuropsych data had been misinterpreted. That body of evidence readily qualifies as \u201csubstantial\u201d under Leahy, Dutkewych, and similar cases. The presence of countervailing treating and vocational opinions does not render USAble\u2019s choice among competing expert views arbitrary, particularly where USAble explained its reasons and repeatedly revisited the file, including after new surgery and new testing. The district court\u2019s role was not to re\u2011weigh but to confirm a rational basis; the described record provides such a basis. The appellate court is therefore likely to agree that USAble\u2019s no\u2011disability conclusion is supported by substantial evidence and that the district court correctly applied the deferential standard."

      "reasoning":"All three issues are governed by abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion review of a discretionary ERISA administrator. The summary reveals a lengthy, iterative review process, long\u2011term payment of benefits before termination, multiple independent medical reviews obtained through third\u2011party vendors, reliance on objectively observable activities and surveillance, and articulated reasons for discounting treating, vocational, and neuropsychological opinions. Those features align with decisions the First Circuit has historically upheld even where there is significant contrary evidence. The structural conflict exists but was mitigated and lacks concrete evidence of bias in this particular claim. USAble\u2019s interpretation of the Plan language and focus on ability to perform full\u2011time light\/sedentary work with reasonable accommodations fall well within the range of reasonable interpretations. Given the robust record supporting both positions, the First Circuit\u2019s substantial\u2011evidence standard strongly favors affirmance of the administrator where, as here, there is ample documentation of improved function and multiple independent experts support the denial. Accordingly, the most likely outcome is affirmance of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on all issues."

      "factual_background":"In 2023, John Doe was a graduate student and resident advisor (RA) at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The university\u2019s Student Conduct Code prohibits \"sexual misconduct,\" defined in relevant part as unwelcomed conduct of a sexual nature that unreasonably interferes with a person\u2019s work or academic performance, interferes with or limits a person\u2019s ability to participate in or benefit from a work or academic program or activity, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or academic environment.\n\nIn May 2023, four female RAs \u2014 J.T., C.T., E.H., and E.Z. \u2014 reported concerns to their supervisor about Doe\u2019s interactions with female RAs. J.T., C.T., and E.H. later filed formal complaints, and S.K. filed a complaint after being interviewed during the investigation. E.Z. expressed concerns but did not file a formal complaint or participate in the investigation.\n\nThe university suspended Doe from his RA duties and appointed defendant Hannah Monbleau, Assistant Director of Student Life and Well-Being, to investigate. Monbleau\u2019s task was to gather evidence to determine whether Doe violated the Student Conduct Code\u2019s prohibition on sexual misconduct. She interviewed complainants J.T., C.T., and E.H., as well as additional students they identified, including S.K. and G.D. After interviewing S.K., S.K. filed a formal complaint. Monbleau also twice interviewed Doe and spoke with A.M., a student identified by Doe. Monbleau compiled the information into a \"Student Rights & Responsibilities Investigative Report,\" concluding that Doe\u2019s conduct met the Code\u2019s definition of sexual misconduct. Doe was given the report and submitted a written response; Monbleau then submitted a reply.\n\nUnder the university\u2019s \"Student Conduct process,\" Doe\u2019s case was assigned to a three-member Conduct Panel composed of defendants Kate Legee (Director of Student Conduct and Prevention), Adam Dunbar (Senior Associate Director of Student Affairs), and Esmeralda Levesque (River Hawk Scholars Academy Coordinator). The Conduct Panel\u2019s role was to determine whether Doe had engaged in sexual misconduct under the Student Conduct Code based on Monbleau\u2019s report, Doe\u2019s response, Monbleau\u2019s reply, and a hearing held on August 22, 2023. At the hearing, C.T., J.T., S.K., and G.D. testified. Doe did not attend. There is no transcript of the hearing in the record; the primary written record is the Conduct Panel\u2019s \"Panel Deliberation Form.\"\n\nThe Panel identified the single charge against Doe as engaging in sexual misconduct as defined by the Student Conduct Code. In a section labeled \"Material findings of fact,\" the Panel summarized undisputed and disputed facts but did not make explicit credibility findings on disputed allegations. In its rationale section, the Panel ultimately found Doe responsible for sexual misconduct and recited specific conduct and its impact on several students as the basis for that conclusion.\n\nThe Panel focused on five categories of conduct: three verbal comments to three different students (G.D., C.T., and S.K.), one isolated physical act involving J.T.\u2019s feet on exercise equipment, and one recurring physical act involving hugs with J.T.\n\n1. Alleged statement to G.D.:\n\nG.D., another student, reported that during the spring 2022 semester she and Doe were cooking together and discussing Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and religious proselytizing when Doe said, \"Oh [G.D.], do you want me to shove my penis in your face?\" G.D. responded, \"what?!\" and Doe repeated the statement, explaining that it was analogous to how Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \"shove\" their beliefs in people\u2019s faces. Doe told the investigator (and maintains) that he made the comment to compare unwanted sexual conduct to religious proselytism and to express disagreement with both. The Conduct Panel accepted Doe\u2019s stated intent and \"assumed as fact\" that contextual intent, but nevertheless characterized the remark as unwelcome. \n\nG.D. initially told Monbleau she \"[d]id not really think about [the interaction] much until she heard about what had happened with her peers.\" At the August 22 hearing, she testified that the comment caused her to feel fear and confusion about Doe\u2019s intent in the moment.\n\n2. Alleged statement to C.T.:\n\nC.T. reported that while she and Doe were on RA duty and talking about food, Doe said, \"if the food is good, I\u2019d have sex while eating.\" Doe told the investigator he did not recall using the word \"sex\" but acknowledged he might have. He suggested C.T. may have misunderstood and that he was speaking in a manner akin to the social media hashtag \"#foodporn.\" The Conduct Panel did not make a specific finding as to Doe\u2019s exact words.\n\nAsked how the comment affected her job or academics, C.T. said \"[i]t\u2019s awkward\" and that it had been awkward at the time and had become more awkward since Doe and another male RA, K.G., became aware that complaints had been filed against them. The Panel\u2019s rationale stated that C.T. indicated she was not comfortable interacting with Doe and that the interactions impacted her ability to work in her student employment position at UMass Lowell. The underlying support in the record for an \"impact\" on her work was limited to her description of awkwardness and discomfort and her desire not to interact with Doe.\n\n3. Alleged statement to S.K.:\n\nS.K.\u2019s complaint arose from a duty shift she worked with Doe. She reported that during that shift, Doe was talkative, began discussing dating apps, and vented about how he was \"going to be alone forever.\" According to S.K., Doe then said, \"I don\u2019t need someone to have sex with, I just want someone to cuddle with,\" and \"I\u2019ll be alone, so I\u2019ll just jerk off and go to bed.\" Doe admitted only to saying, \"I don\u2019t need to [sic] someone to have sex with,\" and denied the additional sexual remark. The Panel\u2019s decision did not specify which exact language it credited, but its rationale referred to Doe\u2019s \"comment\" in the singular, suggesting it relied primarily or solely on the statement Doe admitted.\n\nS.K. told Monbleau she considered Doe\u2019s comments inappropriate in the workplace, that they made her feel \"really uncomfortable\" and \"in shock,\" and that she did not want to work with Doe again. The Panel stated that Doe\u2019s comment was unwelcome, that S.K. left the room to avoid Doe\u2019s conduct, and that she requested not to be on duty with him afterward.\n\n4. Physical conduct involving J.T. \u2014 feet on exercise equipment:\n\nJ.T. reported that on one occasion she was in Doe\u2019s dorm room using exercise equipment when Doe used his feet to move her feet, adjusting her stance on the equipment. The Panel noted there was no indication in the record of any conversation asking J.T. for consent to this contact, and it characterized this touching as unwelcome.\n\n5. Physical conduct involving J.T. \u2014 hugs:\n\nJ.T. also reported that on an unspecified number of occasions, Doe extended his arms toward her to initiate or invite a hug, and that she felt \"obligated to engage\" in the hug. Doe admitted hugging J.T. but said no one, including J.T., ever communicated that his hugs were unwelcome. The Panel, however, concluded that these hugs were unwelcome and included them as part of Doe\u2019s misconduct.\n\nJ.T. was asked how the discomfort she felt as a result of Doe\u2019s conduct affected her job or academics. She said the impact on her job was \"[n]ot too bad\" but that she did not want to be alone with Doe and would feel more uncomfortable if it was just the two of them. The Panel\u2019s rationale stated that Doe\u2019s behavior caused J.T. not to be comfortable interacting with him and that the interactions impacted her ability to work at UMass Lowell, even though her own description reflected only limited impact on her job and an expressed desire not to be alone with him.\n\nBased on these incidents, the Conduct Panel concluded that Doe\u2019s comments and conduct created an offensive working environment in an academic setting for multiple female students, that a reasonable person would find comments of a sexual nature in the academic living and working environment to be offensive, and that Doe\u2019s behavior constituted a pervasive pattern of unwelcome sex-related conduct directed at female students. The Panel found Doe responsible for sexual misconduct under the Student Conduct Code and imposed sanctions including a permanent ban from living in campus housing or entering any residence hall, notification of the ban to campus police, and placement of Doe on elevated probation through graduation. The written decision was communicated to Doe on September 7, 2023.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On September 10, 2023, three days after receiving the Conduct Panel\u2019s written decision, Doe filed a federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the University of Massachusetts, the Trustees, and the Individual Defendants associated with the investigation and Conduct Panel. Among other claims, he asserted that the defendants unlawfully deprived him of his First Amendment rights by punishing him for protected speech and expressive conduct, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H, 11I. He sought both monetary damages and equitable (including injunctive) relief. Shortly after filing, Doe moved for a preliminary injunction: initially against the University and the Trustees, and later specifically against defendant Kate Legee in her capacity as chair of the Conduct Panel. The district court terminated the initial preliminary injunction motion as moot upon the filing of the motion directed at Legee.\n\nWith the parties\u2019 consent, the district court proceeded under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 to consolidate the preliminary injunction proceedings with a trial on the merits, and the parties agreed to a \"case stated\" procedure. Under this procedure, the parties present the case to the court on the undisputed facts in the pre-trial record, allowing the court to engage in some factfinding and draw inferences. The hearing on the case stated record was held on February 5, 2024.\n\nFor reasons not pertinent to the appeal, Doe\u2019s case went forward in the district court only on his First Amendment claims under \u00a7 1983 and the MCRA. Other claims originally pleaded were no longer in the case at the time of the court\u2019s final ruling.",
        "district_court_decision":"On April 9, 2024, the district court issued an order containing Findings of Fact and Rulings of Law. The court adopted the parties\u2019 joint statement of undisputed facts, including the definition of sexual misconduct in the Student Conduct Code, the chronology of Monbleau\u2019s investigation, and the timeline of proceedings before the Conduct Panel. It quoted the Panel\u2019s decision at length but stated it was not making its own findings as to whether it would have reached the same conclusions as the Panel.\n\nOn the \u00a7 1983 First Amendment claim, the court ruled that the claim could proceed only against the Individual Defendants in their official capacities (and, as to Trustees, only in their individual capacities if alleged, though Doe\u2019s complaint did not so plead), and that available remedies on the First Amendment claim against officials in their official capacities were limited to prospective injunctive and declaratory relief. The court applied the student-speech standard from Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), to evaluate the merits of Doe\u2019s First Amendment claim in the public-school context, concluding that the university, acting through the Conduct Panel, had reasonably determined or forecast that Doe\u2019s conduct caused or would cause a substantial disruption of school activities and invaded the rights of others. On that basis, the court held that Doe\u2019s First Amendment claim failed on the merits.\n\nThe court further concluded that even if Doe could otherwise prevail on his First Amendment claim, the Individual Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from monetary damages because the legal rules governing their conduct were not clearly established. The district court also held that the Eleventh Amendment barred Doe\u2019s claims against the University itself and barred his MCRA claim. The court entered judgment accordingly.",

          "reasoning":"The appellate court reviews the constitutional question de novo. Applying Tinker to the record as described, the incidents consist of a handful of sporadic sexual or sex\u2011tinged remarks and two minor, isolated physical contacts, with very modest, largely subjective impacts reported by the complainants: awkwardness, discomfort, a desire not to be alone with Doe, leaving a room once, and requests not to be scheduled with him. There is no evidence of missed classes, degraded academic performance, formal complaints about inability to fulfill RA duties, or broader disruption to residence\u2011life operations. The university characterized the conduct as a \u201cpervasive pattern,\u201d but on this record the pattern is thin and spread over time. \n\nUnder Tinker\u2019s substantial\u2011disruption prong, that standard is \u201cdemanding\u201d; an objectively reasonable forecast of substantial disruption to school activities cannot rest solely on individual discomfort and awkwardness in a workplace\u2011like setting without concrete interference with program operations. Under the \u201crights of others\u201d prong, Tinker\u2014especially in light of more recent student\u2011speech decisions\u2014has been read to require something approaching severe, pervasive harassment, bullying, or stalking that actually denies others access to educational opportunities. The described effects here fall short of that threshold: the complainants remained in their positions, did their jobs, and described the impact in minimal terms (e.g., J.T. saying the impact on her job was \u201cnot too bad\u201d). \n\nThe university\u2019s viewpoint\u2011neutral interest in enforcing its conduct code and maintaining a non\u2011harassing environment is legitimate, but Tinker does not permit public institutions simply to define as punishable any unwelcome or offensive sexualized comment between adults in the absence of substantial disruption or a serious rights\u2011invasion. Because the district court accepted the Panel\u2019s generalized conclusions and treated the modest impacts on the complainants as sufficient to satisfy Tinker, it effectively diluted the substantial\u2011disruption and rights\u2011of\u2011others standards. On de novo review, the appellate court is likely to hold that the university\u2019s discipline of Doe, on this specific record and theory, violated the First Amendment, and thus to reverse the district court\u2019s merits ruling on the \u00a7 1983 claim for prospective relief."

          "standard_of_review":"de novo",
          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"Qualified immunity is also reviewed de novo. Even if disciplining Doe for this conduct under Tinker is held unconstitutional, the next question is whether the unlawfulness was clearly established for reasonable university officials in 2023 in this particular factual and institutional setting. There is no controlling Supreme Court or First Circuit precedent squarely applying Tinker\u2014or any other student\u2011speech framework\u2014to adult university students acting as RAs in a quasi\u2011employment, residential\u2011life environment, based on unwelcome sexualized comments and minor physical contact alleged to amount to sexual misconduct\/harassment. \n\nPrecedents like Papish clearly establish that public universities cannot punish merely offensive or indecent ideas, but they do not clearly delineate the boundary between protected speech and actionable sex\u2011based harassment in a residential and workplace\u2011like context, especially where the institution is also subject to Title IX\u2011style obligations. Other cases dealing with threats, bullying, or extreme stalking (such as Valencia\u2011type fact patterns) are materially different and do not put beyond debate that disciplining a student\u2011RA for repeated, unwanted sexualized workplace comments and touching is unconstitutional. \n\nGiven the lack of factually analogous, binding authority and the competing obligations universities reasonably believe they have to curb sexual harassment among RAs, it would not have been clear to every reasonable official that imposing discipline here violated the First Amendment. That places the case within the heartland of qualified immunity doctrine, which protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the Individual Defendants are immune from damages is therefore likely to be affirmed."

      },
      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",
      "confidence":0.76,
      "reasoning":"The posture and framing strongly suggest a split outcome. The district court applied Tinker in a way that equated subjective awkwardness and desire to avoid a colleague with substantial disruption or a cognizable invasion of rights. In the public\u2011university context with adult students, and under the summary of impacts in this record, that application is vulnerable on de novo review, especially given the Supreme Court\u2019s insistence that Tinker\u2019s standard is demanding and that schools cannot punish mere offensiveness. The appellate court is likely to reweigh the legal sufficiency of the university\u2019s justifications and hold that Doe\u2019s discipline for this set of remarks and minor physical contacts violated the First Amendment, thus reversing on the merits of the \u00a7 1983 claim as to prospective relief.\n\nAt the same time, the qualified\u2011immunity question is distinct and governed by the specific\u2011clearly\u2011established\u2011law requirement. Existing precedent does not clearly resolve the legality of disciplining a student\u2011RA for unwelcome sexualized conduct in a residence\u2011life workplace context under Tinker, particularly against the backdrop of universities\u2019 perceived Title IX obligations. Reasonable officials could believe, even if wrongly, that disciplining such conduct was permissible to protect others\u2019 rights and prevent harassment. That uncertainty makes it very unlikely an appellate court would expose the Individual Defendants to personal monetary liability. Thus, the likely disposition is to reverse the district court\u2019s no\u2011violation holding (granting or remanding for entry of appropriate declaratory\/prospective injunctive relief), but affirm its grant of qualified immunity on damages, producing a mixed overall outcome."

      },
      "factual_background":"In 2019, New York enacted the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), which significantly changed the state\u2019s abortion and fetal homicide laws. Before the RHA, it was a crime to perform an abortion after twenty-four weeks of gestation, whether on another person or oneself, unless the procedure was necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman. The RHA removed those abortion-related offenses from New York\u2019s penal laws and instead created Article 25\u2011A of the Public Health Law. Under that framework, licensed health care practitioners may perform abortions within twenty\u2011four weeks of gestation, and after twenty\u2011four weeks if the fetus is not viable or if the pregnant woman\u2019s life or health is at risk. The RHA also eliminated the crime of fetal homicide from the state\u2019s homicide statute. Previously, homicide included causing the death of a fetus after twenty\u2011four weeks of gestation. With the RHA\u2019s amendments, causing the death of a fetus, at any gestational age, no longer falls within the state\u2019s homicide provision. In response to the RHA, a group of plaintiffs\u2014including expectant mothers, doctors, social workers, and fetuses (through proposed representatives)\u2014filed suit alleging that the RHA violated the constitutional rights of those groups. Mary Doe, a social worker with over two decades of experience working with pregnant mothers, sought to challenge the RHA\u2019s decriminalization of abortion and repeal of fetal homicide on behalf of a putative class of \u2018viable fetuses\u2019 in New York (the \u2018Viable Fetus Class\u2019). Doe alleged that by decriminalizing abortion after twenty\u2011four weeks (subject to the new statutory conditions) and by removing fetal homicide as an offense, the RHA violated the fetuses\u2019 asserted rights to life and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and their rights to legal redress under the First Amendment. She claimed that viable fetuses in New York faced increased risk of being aborted or otherwise harmed without criminal protection. In later proposed amended pleadings, Doe and the other plaintiffs identified a specific viable fetus, \u2018Baby Nicholas\u2019 (a pseudonym), as a member and proposed class representative of the Viable Fetus Class. According to the proposed amended complaint filed after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, Baby Nicholas was at least twenty\u2011four weeks\u2019 gestational age. His natural mother and grandmother, using the pseudonyms Rachel Brown\u2011Lee and Miriam Brown, were proposed as his next friends. The post\u2011Dobbs pleading alleged that Brown\u2011Lee\u2019s former partner had physically assaulted her in 2017 and 2018 when she was pregnant, and had verbally and physically abused her as recently as 2019. Brown\u2011Lee obtained an order of protection against him, in effect through 2027, but alleged that he violated that order and continued to act in threatening and emotionally abusive ways. The pleadings alleged that this history and ongoing threats placed Brown\u2011Lee, and consequently Baby Nicholas in utero, at risk of future physical harm. The plaintiffs further contended that, because fetal homicide had been decriminalized, there was diminished deterrence for attacks on pregnant women that might kill a viable fetus, and that this increased risk applied generally to fetuses in New York and particularly to Baby Nicholas, given Brown\u2011Lee\u2019s history with her former partner.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In 2021, plaintiffs, including Mary Doe and others, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York challenging the RHA. As relevant here, Doe sought to bring constitutional claims on behalf of a putative class of viable fetuses. She alleged that the RHA\u2019s provisions decriminalizing abortion and eliminating fetal homicide violated fetuses\u2019 rights to life and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and their rights to legal redress under the First Amendment. She sought damages as well as equitable relief, including a declaration that the RHA is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing New York officials from enforcing its provisions. Because Doe herself is not a fetus, she moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2) to be appointed as \u2018next friend\u2019 to the Viable Fetus Class. In her motion and pleadings, she described her background as a social worker for pregnant mothers but did not identify by name or otherwise describe any specific fetus within the putative class and did not propose a fetus to serve as a named class representative under Rule 23.",
        "district_court_decision":"Defendants opposed Doe\u2019s appointment as next friend, arguing that she lacked a \u2018significant relationship\u2019 with any fetus in the proposed class and that Rule 17 did not permit next friends to represent fetuses. In August 2021, the district court denied Doe\u2019s next\u2011friend motion. The court concluded that a would\u2011be next friend must demonstrate a \u2018significant relationship\u2019 with the minor or incompetent person to be represented, and that Doe had not shown such a relationship with any fetus in the putative class. Without addressing whether Rule 17(c) permits next\u2011friend representation of fetuses, the court declined to appoint her. Shortly thereafter, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Doe\u2019s claims for lack of standing, reasoning that because Doe had not been appointed next friend, she could not establish standing to assert claims on behalf of the Viable Fetus Class. The district court entered judgment for Defendants on October 26, 2021. The district court also dismissed the other plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding the RHA, either for lack of standing or for failure to state a claim; those plaintiffs did not appeal. Less than a month after judgment, the plaintiffs moved to reopen the case and sought leave to file an amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint, pre\u2011Dobbs, identified \u2018Baby Nicholas\u2019 as a specific viable fetus and proposed his mother and grandmother as next friends. While this motion was pending, the Supreme Court decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, holding that the federal Constitution does not protect a right to abortion. Plaintiffs then sought and received permission to revise their post\u2011judgment motion and proposed amended complaint in light of Dobbs. They filed post\u2011judgment motions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e), 60(b)(1), and 60(b)(6), accompanied by a new \u2018post\u2011Dobbs\u2019 proposed amended complaint. They argued that: (1) Dobbs represented an intervening change in controlling law or an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from the prior judgment, and (2) they had not been afforded an opportunity to amend the original complaint under Rule 15. The post\u2011Dobbs complaint continued to identify Baby Nicholas as class representative of the Viable Fetus Class and again proposed Brown\u2011Lee and Brown as his next friends. It alleged details of Brown\u2011Lee\u2019s prior abuse and the continuing threats posed by her former partner, as well as the existing order of protection. In March 2023, the district court denied the post\u2011judgment motions. It concluded that Dobbs did not alter the standing analysis that had led to dismissal of the Viable Fetus Class claims. The court further held that amendment would be futile because the post\u2011Dobbs complaint did not plausibly establish that Baby Nicholas had standing to challenge the RHA.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Mary Doe appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and post\u2011judgment orders. She challenges (1) the denial of her motion to be appointed next friend to the Viable Fetus Class under Rule 17(c), arguing that the district court improperly required her to have a \u2018significant relationship\u2019 with the fetuses as a condition of appointment, and (2) the denial of her post\u2011judgment motions under Rules 59(e) and 60(b) seeking vacatur of the judgment and leave to file the post\u2011Dobbs amended complaint. With respect to the latter, she disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that the proposed amended complaint would be futile for lack of standing, arguing that the allegations concerning Baby Nicholas are sufficient to establish standing to challenge the RHA."

She argues that the district court should have analyzed the full Rule 17(c) criteria rather than disqualifying her solely for lack of a significant relationship.",
          "Regarding Article III standing for the original complaint, Doe argues that the class-based nature of the claims and the widespread operation of the RHA make it unnecessary at the pleading stage to identify an individual fetus by name or detailed circumstances. She contends that viable fetuses in New York are, as a group, exposed to increased risks of abortion and violence due to decriminalization, and that this systemic impact should suffice to demonstrate a live case or controversy.",
          "On the post\u2011judgment motions, Doe argues that Dobbs significantly changed the constitutional landscape concerning abortion and thus constitutes an intervening change in controlling law or extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from judgment under Rules 59(e) and 60(b). She asserts that the district court should have allowed amendment under Rule 15 to conform the pleadings to the post\u2011Dobbs legal context.",
          "In support of standing for the post\u2011Dobbs complaint, Doe contends that the allegations about Baby Nicholas, including his gestational age (at least twenty\u2011four weeks) and the detailed history of Brown\u2011Lee\u2019s abuse by her former partner, provide sufficient specificity to show that Baby Nicholas faced a substantial risk of future harm while in utero. She argues that this risk is both imminent and traceable to the RHA\u2019s provisions that decriminalized abortion and repealed fetal homicide, because those changes allegedly reduce legal protections for viable fetuses and diminish deterrence of violence against pregnant women.",
          "She further argues that the short duration of pregnancy and the in\u2011utero nature of the alleged harms mean that Baby Nicholas\u2019s claims are \u2018inherently transitory\u2019 and thus not moot even if he was born by the time of appellate review. She maintains that there was at least an imminent risk of harm during the pregnancy period that supports standing to seek prospective relief against the RHA\u2019s operation.",
          "With respect to damages, Doe maintains that exposure to a substantial risk of abortion or fatal harm in utero, and the associated fear and constraints, should be treated as a cognizable injury, or at least that the constitutional nature of the alleged violations supports claims for nominal damages. She contends that the RHA\u2019s legal regime itself constitutes an injury to the asserted rights of viable fetuses.",

They assert that Baby Nicholas did not actually suffer any concrete injury from the RHA; at most, he was exposed to a potential future risk of harm that never materialized into a completed abortion or physical injury, which is inadequate to support claims for compensatory or nominal damages.",
          "On prospective equitable relief, they argue that the complaint does not plausibly allege an imminent injury. They note that Brown\u2011Lee is not alleged to have concrete plans to obtain an abortion of Baby Nicholas, and that general assertions that she had \u2018considered\u2019 abortion in prior pregnancies are insufficient to show that an abortion was certainly impending or that there was a substantial risk it would occur.",
          "With respect to the repeal of fetal homicide, Defendants contend that any threat posed by Brown\u2011Lee\u2019s former partner or by members of the public is speculative and not fairly traceable to the RHA. They note that the former partner\u2019s violent acts began before the RHA\u2019s enactment, and that he remains subject to serious criminal penalties under New York\u2019s assault and related statutes for harming Brown\u2011Lee, which they argue undercuts the claim that the repeal of fetal homicide meaningfully increases the risk of violence or that any such risk is causally linked to the RHA.",
          "Defendants further argue that, because the alleged harm depends on the independent actions of third parties (such as Brown\u2011Lee\u2019s former partner), Plaintiff has not shown that those third parties are likely to act in a way that would injure Baby Nicholas as a predictable response to the RHA\u2019s statutory changes. They maintain that this breaks the chain of causation necessary for standing and renders any asserted risk too attenuated and speculative to be considered imminent.",
          "Finally, they contend that the district court properly denied leave to amend on futility grounds because, even taking the post\u2011Dobbs allegations as true, Baby Nicholas lacked standing to seek any form of relief against the RHA, and thus amendment could not cure the jurisdictional defect."

Even crediting all allegations, he suffered no past abortion, no physical injury, and no completed violation of a legally protected interest. The complaint alleged only a heightened risk of harm while in utero based on (a) his mother\u2019s history of domestic violence and (b) the RHA\u2019s decriminalization of abortion and repeal of fetal homicide supposedly reducing deterrence. That risk is highly contingent on independent third\u2011party conduct and pre\u2011existing circumstances that predated the RHA; it is too speculative to qualify as an imminent, concrete injury fairly traceable to the statute or redressable by invalidating it.

To the extent the court reaches mootness (rather than resolving the appeal entirely on standing), any personal claim for prospective relief based on in\u2011utero risk is moot. Doe invokes the \u2018inherently transitory\u2019 exception, but that doctrine presupposes the existence of a properly certified class or at least a live claim at the time of a timely motion for class certification. Here, there was no class certification, and standing was lacking from the outset. When a case never satisfied Article III, the inherently transitory exception cannot be used to revive it. The appellate court is likely to either: (1) hold that the claims were non\u2011justiciable from inception and thus never reach mootness; or (2) agree that, in any event, no exception would save the claims.

For damages, mere exposure to a risk of injury that never materialized does not constitute a past, concrete injury. The complaint does not allege that Baby Nicholas was aborted, physically harmed, or otherwise suffered a completed violation attributable to the RHA. The bid to frame the legal regime itself as a damages injury or to bootstrap nominal damages from a purely hypothetical violation conflicts with governing standing precedents requiring an actual or at least certainly impending injury.\n\nFor prospective equitable relief, the alleged harms hinge on speculative chains of causation: (1) his mother might seek or be pressured to seek an abortion at some undefined point; (2) a third party, such as her former partner, might commit violence against her; and (3) the RHA\u2019s decriminalization of abortion and repeal of fetal homicide would so reduce deterrence that these actions become substantially more likely. No concrete plans for abortion are alleged; the domestic abuse began before the RHA; and New York\u2019s general criminal statutes continue to impose serious penalties for violence against pregnant women. These facts undermine both imminence and traceability. Because the complaint fails to show a substantial, imminent risk of harm fairly traceable to the RHA and redressable by the requested injunction and declaration, standing is not established for any remedy.

Rule 17(c) cannot cure this, and the district court acted within its discretion in insisting on a meaningful connection and rejecting an effort by a stranger to litigate generalized objections to state abortion policy on behalf of all viable fetuses. Dobbs did not change standing doctrine, so there was no basis to reopen the judgment; and the post\u2011Dobbs complaint, even as amended to add Baby Nicholas, still failed both causation and imminence requirements for standing to seek damages or prospective relief. Either because the case lacked standing from the outset or because any in\u2011utero claim has since become moot without fitting any exception, the appellate court has no jurisdictional foothold to disturb the district court\u2019s rulings.

      "factual_background":"George Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020, during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, when Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes, ignoring Floyd\u2019s pleas that he could not breathe. The incident was captured on widely viewed video and led to Chauvin\u2019s murder conviction and related convictions of other officers. Floyd\u2019s death sparked a broad public reckoning on racism and policing and prompted large-scale protests in cities across the United States and worldwide, including in Cambridge and nearby Boston. Thousands of protesters in Cambridge demanded action regarding police brutality and impunity. In Boston, racial-justice protesters allegedly encountered unreasonable force from the Boston Police Department, leading to federal litigation alleging constitutional violations. Protests and scrutiny of law enforcement continued for many months, into 2021. On February 24, 2021, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill\u2019s stated purpose was to hold law enforcement accountable for misconduct, improve transparency through data collection, and reform police training and policies. \n\nBrian Hussey joined the Cambridge Police Department in 1998. He worked as a patrol officer for about ten years, then joined the Department\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) in 2009. In the SIU, he participated in hundreds of drug investigations, worked extensively with confidential informants (often current or former drug users), and regularly interacted with current drug users throughout Cambridge. After about a decade in SIU, he returned to patrol in 2020. \n\nOn February 25, 2021, at 8:08 a.m., Hussey shared on his personal Facebook page a news article titled \u201cHouse Democrats Reintroduce Police Reform Bill in Honor of George Floyd.\u201d He added his own comment: \u201cThis is what it\u2019s come to . . . \u2018honoring\u2019 a career criminal, a thief and druggie . . . the future of this country is bleak at best.\u201d Hussey made this post from his personal phone while at home. A screenshot taken about an hour later showed two comments under his post, to which Hussey did not respond. He deleted the post a few hours after making it, later testifying that he removed it because it did not generate much conversation. \n\nHussey\u2019s Facebook account was configured as \u201crestricted,\u201d so only people he had accepted as Facebook \u201cfriends\u201d could see his posts, and he did not accept friend requests from people he did not know. At the time, he had 674 Facebook friends, including roughly ninety current or former Cambridge Police Department members. Although his profile did not identify him as a police officer, most of his Facebook friends knew he was one. \n\nAround March 3, 2021, approximately six days after the post, then-Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. was contacted by a senior officer of the Cambridge chapter of the NAACP, who alerted him to Hussey\u2019s post. The post had been screenshotted and shared with the NAACP shortly after Hussey posted it. Bard and the Cambridge City Manager then met via videoconference with the NAACP officer, another NAACP member and community organizer, and a former mayor of Cambridge to discuss the post. According to Bard\u2019s testimony, these community representatives were alarmed and concerned and believed the post called into question the Cambridge Police Department\u2019s ability to serve the community in a bias-free manner. Bard requested and received a copy of the post and forwarded it to the Department\u2019s Professional Standards Unit (PSU) to investigate as a possible violation of Department policy. \n\nHussey was placed on administrative leave while the PSU conducted its investigation. During this leave, he received several messages of support from fellow Cambridge officers. On March 7, 2021, as part of the PSU inquiry, Hussey submitted a written statement. In it, he stated that what happened to George Floyd on May 25, 2020, \u201cnever should have happened,\u201d that Floyd did not deserve to die, and that Derek Chauvin was a \u201cdisgrace to the badge\u201d who probably never should have been an officer, as were the officers who stood by and did nothing. Hussey stated he was \u201c100% in favor of police reform.\u201d He then explained that he disagreed with naming a police reform bill in honor of George Floyd. He acknowledged that Floyd\u2019s murder was the \u201cproverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d leading to calls for police reform, \u201chence the naming of the bill in his \u2018honor.\u2019\u201d But he wrote that, while Floyd did not deserve to be killed, Floyd was \u201cstill a violent criminal,\u201d and that attaching the name of \u201ca violent career criminal, in \u2018honor,\u2019 to a reform bill aimed at the betterment of policing\u201d was, in his view, a disservice to the spirit of the bill. \n\nThe PSU also interviewed Hussey. In that interview, Hussey acknowledged he did not call people with substance use disorders \u201cdruggies\u201d to their faces because, in his words, it would be unprofessional. \n\nOn April 14, 2021, about six weeks after Hussey was placed on leave, the PSU issued a Final Report of Investigation. It concluded that Hussey\u2019s Facebook post violated the Department\u2019s policy against discourtesy, rudeness, or insolence to members of the public and the rule requiring officers to be courteous and act professionally at all times. On about April 28, 2021, roughly two weeks after the report and two months after the Facebook post, Commissioner Bard notified Hussey that he would be suspended without pay for four days for these rule and policy violations. In his deposition, Bard stated that he regarded Hussey\u2019s post as damaging to the reputation of the Cambridge Police Department and especially harmful in the context of the prevailing national climate surrounding policing and racial justice. He testified that he believed it was important for the Department to maintain a positive reputation within the community because public trust and the perception that the Department is legitimate and bias-free are, in his view, essential for it to function properly and do its job.",
      "procedural_history":{

He initially also sued then-Commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr. in his official capacity. When Christine Elow became Commissioner in January 2022, she was automatically substituted as the official-capacity defendant under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2).

Hussey filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment seeking a ruling that the Department was liable for violating his First Amendment rights. Applying the public-employee speech framework, the district court assumed or found that Hussey spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern and that his speech motivated the disciplinary action, but conducted Pickering balancing and concluded that the Department\u2019s interest in regulating his speech outweighed the free speech interests.

He maintains that his comment, though critical, was within the bounds of public debate over how to respond legislatively to George Floyd\u2019s murder and therefore should receive strong protection in the Pickering balance.",
          "He contends that the district court improperly diminished the value of his speech by characterizing it as inflammatory, insulting, or disparaging, and that terms like \u201ccareer criminal,\u201d \u201cthief,\u201d and \u201cdruggie,\u201d as used in his post, do not qualify as the extreme, vulgar, or profane language that prior cases have treated as warranting reduced weight. In his view, any such reduction of weight based on perceived offensiveness effectively penalizes his viewpoint rather than the manner of expression.",
          "Hussey asserts that the Cambridge Police Department failed to show that his post caused any actual disruption to internal operations or community relations. He urges adoption or clarification of a rule that when the primary purpose of speech is to discuss a matter of public concern, a government employer must show actual disruption, not just a prediction, before imposing discipline. Because the record contains no evidence of community unrest, impaired investigations, breakdown in cooperation, or internal disharmony attributable to his post, he argues that the employer\u2019s side of the Pickering balance is weak.",
          "Even if actual disruption is not required, Hussey argues that the Department\u2019s prediction of disruption was unreasonable and legally insufficient, amounting to mere speculation. He emphasizes that his post was made from home, on his personal phone, to a restricted Facebook audience of friends and acquaintances, and that he deleted it within hours. He notes that the only internal reaction from fellow officers was support for him and that there is little or no evidence of any deterioration in workplace functioning or community relations in the weeks after the post. He further points to the two-month period between his placement on leave and his suspension, during which no broader public backlash or media attention materialized, as undermining the claimed prediction of future disruption.",
          "Hussey argues that the Department\u2019s asserted interest in maintaining community trust was a pretext for viewpoint discrimination\u2014disciplining him because officials and some community members strongly disagreed with his view of George Floyd and the naming of the bill. He points to the fact that the initial complaint came from a senior local NAACP officer and that the Department responded swiftly to concerns from politically connected community members. He also claims that other speech potentially affecting harmony or community trust was treated differently, such as: (a) an instance in which Commissioner Elow allegedly referred to drug users as \u201ccrackheads\u201d in a conversation with him, but was not disciplined; (b) a tweet by the Cambridge Police Patrol Officers Association referencing a violent \u201cpurge\u201d in connection with a proposed police reform bill, which was not investigated to his knowledge; and (c) an officer who used an expletive about a congressman on the Department\u2019s official Twitter account, whom he characterizes as having been treated more leniently. He offers these as examples to argue that he was singled out because of the viewpoint he expressed.",
          "He maintains that the Department\u2019s investigation was incomplete or skewed toward confirming a disruption rationale and did not meaningfully explore who actually saw his post, how widely it was disseminated, or whether it reached or affected drug users or others he was alleged to have disparaged.

          "They contend that Hussey\u2019s Facebook post, which labeled George Floyd a \u201ccareer criminal, a thief and druggie\u201d and suggested that honoring him signaled a bleak future for the country, was mocking and disparaging, reducing the weight of his and the public\u2019s interest in the speech in the Pickering balance. They point out that Hussey\u2019s own later PSU statement, in which he expressed support for police reform and condemned Floyd\u2019s killing and Chauvin\u2019s conduct, shows that he could have conveyed his policy disagreement in a less derogatory manner, but did not do so in the original post.",

They argue that their prediction here was reasonable and grounded in specific facts: multiple respected community leaders, including a senior NAACP officer, another NAACP member, and a former mayor, expressed alarm and concern that Hussey\u2019s post called into question the Department\u2019s ability to serve the public in a bias-free manner. Bard testified he believed the post risked undermining the trust and legitimacy the Department had worked to build, particularly given Hussey\u2019s extensive public-facing work with vulnerable populations such as drug users.",
          "They argue that the manner, timing, and dissemination of Hussey\u2019s speech supported their prediction of disruption. Although the post was made off duty, on a personal device, and to a restricted Facebook audience, it was rapidly screenshotted and passed beyond Hussey\u2019s friend list to community organizations. The Department asserts that, because online speech can be quickly and widely shared beyond its initial audience, it was reasonable to anticipate that Hussey\u2019s post could reach a broad segment of the public and fuel perceptions of bias or disrespect, thereby eroding community cooperation and confidence.",
          "With respect to the two-month interval between Hussey\u2019s administrative leave and his suspension, the Department contends that the absence of visible unrest during the PSU investigation does not negate the reasonableness of its original prediction of disruption. Rather, it argues that its prompt, visible response\u2014including placing Hussey on administrative leave and initiating an investigation\u2014may itself have reassured community members, helped avert broader backlash, and thus explained the lack of subsequent disruption. The Department maintains that it should not be penalized for having taken proactive steps that may have prevented the very disruption it reasonably feared.",
          "On the allegation of viewpoint discrimination, the Department asserts that its motive was to protect community trust and enforce professional standards, not to punish Hussey\u2019s viewpoint about the naming of federal legislation. It emphasizes that the Official-capacity defendants responded to community concerns about bias and applied established policies prohibiting discourtesy and requiring professional conduct. They argue that the comparison incidents Hussey cites are either factually distinct or do not demonstrate disparate treatment: (a) the alleged \u201ccrackheads\u201d remark by Commissioner Elow occurred privately, in a one-on-one conversation, and was not publicly disseminated; (b) the Department may not have had authority to regulate or investigate an independent police union\u2019s social media activity; and (c) the officer who used an expletive about a congressman on the Department\u2019s official Twitter account was, according to the record, suspended for five days\u2014more than Hussey\u2019s four-day suspension\u2014undermining any claim of leniency. They thus contend that there is no genuine evidence that Hussey was singled out because of his viewpoint rather than because of the reasonably perceived risk his specific speech posed to the Department\u2019s mission and public standing."

The panel will likely agree with the district court that, even assuming Hussey spoke as a private citizen on a core matter of public concern, the manner and content of his speech materially reduce the weight on his side: the post was not a reasoned critique of the bill but a mocking, disparaging characterization of George Floyd as a \u201ccareer criminal, a thief and druggie\u201d and a bleak prediction for the country, posted by a police officer in a highly charged post\u2011Floyd environment. First Circuit precedent (e.g., Curran, MacRae) gives substantial weight to police departments\u2019 interests in discipline, neutrality, and community trust, and allows those interests to outweigh employee speech even on public issues when the speech undermines perceived impartiality. Here, senior NAACP officials and a former mayor immediately expressed serious concern that the post cast doubt on the Department\u2019s ability to police in a bias\u2011free way, and the Commissioner testified to the risk to public trust given Hussey\u2019s role and the Department\u2019s work with drug users. Given that law enforcement is accorded heightened deference in this context and the employer imposed only a brief suspension for discourtesy, an appellate court is likely to hold that the Department\u2019s operational and public\u2011trust interests reasonably outweighed Hussey\u2019s and the public\u2019s interest in this particular expression, and thus affirm summary judgment."

Considering (1) the extraordinary national and local context of George Floyd\u2019s murder, ongoing protests, and intense scrutiny of police racism and brutality; (2) Hussey\u2019s position as a sworn officer with extensive contact with vulnerable communities, particularly drug users; (3) the post\u2019s directly disparaging language and the reasonable inference that many readers would view it as reflecting bias toward a figure widely associated with racial\u2011justice concerns and drug addiction; and (4) the concrete, contemporaneous alarm expressed by a senior NAACP officer, another NAACP representative, and a former mayor that the post undermined confidence in bias\u2011free policing, the employer\u2019s prediction that the speech would erode community trust and impair departmental effectiveness is well supported. The limited initial audience and later deletion do not undercut the reasonableness of the prediction in a social\u2011media setting where screenshots were, in fact, rapidly shared outside Hussey\u2019s \u201crestricted\u201d circle. Nor does the lack of subsequent public unrest during the investigation negate the prediction, particularly where the Department\u2019s prompt action may have mitigated fallout.

The record shows that the triggering concern came from community leaders who believed the post suggested bias and undermined trust, and that the Commissioner framed the problem in terms of reputation, legitimacy, and compliance with existing courtesy\/professionalism rules. The Department suspended Hussey for four days. The comparators Hussey offers do not create a triable issue of impermissible viewpoint discrimination: the alleged \u201ccrackheads\u201d remark by the Commissioner was a private conversation, not public speech; the union tweet appears outside direct departmental discipline; and the officer who used an expletive about a congressman on the official Twitter account reportedly received a longer suspension, suggesting stricter, not more lenient, treatment of comparable or more public misconduct. There is no evidence that favorable treatment was given to officers expressing the Department\u2019s preferred view on George Floyd or police reform, only that this particular disparaging, public\u2011facing post drew discipline under neutral professional standards. On this record, a reasonable jury could not find that the Department acted primarily out of disagreement with Hussey\u2019s viewpoint rather than legitimate concern about community trust.

First Circuit and other circuit cases give police departments substantial leeway to discipline public speech that reasonably threatens community trust, even when the speech references matters of public concern, and allow reliance on reasonable, evidence\u2011based predictions rather than actual disruption. Here, the speech\u2019s value is diluted by its mocking, disparaging tone toward a figure symbolizing racial\u2011justice concerns and by Hussey\u2019s own later demonstration that he could have conveyed his policy disagreement in a more professional way. On the government\u2011interest side, the City marshals specific, contemporaneous evidence of probable harm, and the discipline imposed is relatively modest. The appellant\u2019s attempt to reframe the law to require actual disruption conflicts with binding precedent, and his pretext\/comparator evidence is weak and largely distinguishable. Given these factors, an appellate court applying de novo review to legal questions and viewing the facts in Hussey\u2019s favor would still likely conclude that no reasonable jury could find a First Amendment violation, and thus affirm the district court in full."

      "factual_background":"Carmen Quintana-Dieppa is a 62-year-old Puerto Rican woman who began working for the Department of the Army in 1988. Since 2009, she served as the Child Youth and School Services (CYSS) Coordinator at Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico, a supervisory position within the Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation (FMWR) Division. In September 2014, after nearly three decades of Army employment, she filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint alleging the Army discriminated against her based on national origin.\n\nWhile that EEOC complaint was pending, the Army's 81st Regional Support Command at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, received allegations of mismanagement and poor working conditions in the FMWR Division at Fort Buchanan. In May 2016, the 81st Regional Support Command initiated an investigation into the FMWR supervisory chain, which included Quintana and other supervisors. The investigating officer concluded that Quintana's authoritative leadership style created a toxic work environment, that she did not always treat subordinates with dignity and respect, and recommended that she be removed from her supervisory CYSS position, suspended for at least ten days, transferred to a nonsupervisory position within FMWR, and transitioned into retirement. The Commanding General accepted the findings but, rather than immediately implementing the recommended measures, forwarded the results to Colonel Michael T. Harvey, Fort Buchanan's Garrison Commander, for determination of appropriate disciplinary or corrective actions. Col. Harvey then requested a second investigation focused on Quintana's treatment of her subordinates.\n\nThis second investigation, conducted from August to October 2016, confirmed the first investigation's findings. Twenty-seven individuals reported that they had witnessed or experienced disrespectful or disparaging behavior by Quintana, and the investigation found that she routinely exhibited favoritism, used intimidating language, and engaged in retaliatory tactics toward subordinates. The investigating officer concluded that her pattern of conduct warranted disciplinary action.\n\nThree months after the second investigation concluded, Quintana received a performance evaluation for the period July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Her then-supervisor, Daniel Carter, rated her performance as \"satisfactory\" instead of the prior year's \"outstanding\" rating. Carter cited her failure to expand youth sports and school programs as the reason for the lower rating. Quintana testified under oath that she believed the downgrade was clearly tied to the second investigation's results and to professional jealousy. She did not receive performance standards or an evaluation for the 2016-2017 period, and Carter testified that during his tenure as acting FMWR Program Director, none of the fifteen employees he supervised received new performance standards for that period and multiple employees, including Quintana, did not receive evaluations.\n\nConcerned about Quintana's management issues, Col. Harvey signed a reassignment letter on January 25, 2017, demoting her to a nonsupervisory role. However, a hiring freeze implemented two days earlier, lasting about two and a half months, prevented her immediate reassignment. In May 2017, despite the reassignment plan, Quintana told her supervisor she needed a non-competitive promotion to an NF-05 Coordinator position. She was informed that Fort Buchanan's CYSS program did not meet the demographic requirements for that position.\n\nIn June 2017, there were personnel changes within the FMWR Division: Tod Antony Scalf became the new Programs Director after Carter left. After reviewing the second investigation file, Scalf determined that removing Quintana from management was justified. He signed a revised reassignment letter transferring her to a newly created position at the same pay and grade. The letter identified serious concerns about her management style as the reason for the reassignment. On November 17, 2017, Quintana received the reassignment notice and was placed on a one-day administrative leave.\n\nApproximately six weeks later, a Hispanic woman, Wendy Winston, temporarily assumed Quintana's CYSS Coordinator duties. On January 31, another Hispanic woman, Aida Aguil\u00fa, who was about fourteen months younger than Quintana, succeeded Winston as Acting CYSS Coordinator.",

Quintana opposed, filing a Statement of Contested Facts and a separate section of additional purportedly undisputed facts. The district court determined that Quintana's submissions did not comply with Local Rule 56: her Statement of Additional Facts interspersed facts throughout her responses and failed to present additional facts in separately numbered paragraphs; many of her denials or qualifications in the Statement of Contested Facts were unsupported by proper or specific record citations, failed to contradict the Army's assertions, or lacked citations altogether. The court emphasized that many record citations did not support her propositions or were not in the record. Concluding that her noncompliance imposed a substantial burden, the court deemed the Army's proposed facts almost entirely undisputed. It then found no genuine issue of material fact and determined that no reasonable jury could find in Quintana's favor. Applying the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework to her Title VII sex and race discrimination claims, her ADEA age discrimination claim, and her Title VII retaliation claim, the court held that Quintana had not established a prima facie case on any of her claims and, even assuming a prima facie case, she had not shown that the Army's stated reasons for its actions were pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Consequently, the court granted summary judgment to the Army on all challenged claims.",

If established, a presumption of unlawful discrimination arises and the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action. If the employer does so, the presumption disappears and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer's stated reason is pretext for discrimination. To show pretext, the plaintiff must point to specific, competent evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the employer's explanation is not just wrong but so implausible that the employer more likely than not did not believe it, and that the real motive was discriminatory.

Causation can be shown, among other ways, through temporal proximity between the employer's knowledge of the protected activity and the adverse action, though the proximity must generally be very close.

It maintains that the district court acted within its discretion in deeming its factual assertions admitted and in disregarding improperly presented additional facts.",

          "On the merits, the Army maintains that it reassigned Quintana for legitimate, non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory reasons: serious and substantiated concerns about her management style and treatment of employees, based on two internal investigations and numerous subordinate complaints. It emphasizes that both investigations documented a pattern of disrespectful, disparaging, intimidating, and retaliatory behavior toward subordinates that justified removing her from a supervisory role, and that she was moved to a new position with the same pay and grade.",
          "The Army argues that its reliance on the internal investigation reports is proper and that those reports are not offered to prove the truth of every subordinate allegation but to show that management had a reasonable, good-faith basis to believe there were significant problems with Quintana's supervision. It disputes any suggestion that the reports were fabricated and notes that Quintana has not produced competent evidence to support such a claim.",

          "With respect to alleged discriminatory replacement, the Army notes that following Quintana's reassignment, her duties were temporarily assumed by Wendy Winston, a Hispanic woman, and then by Aida Aguil\u00fa, another Hispanic woman who was only slightly younger than Quintana, undermining any inference of sex, race, or age bias based solely on who assumed her former responsibilities. It disputes that the offer to a younger male candidate, who did not ultimately serve as her replacement, is sufficient to show that its stated reason for reassignment was a pretext.",

It disputes her characterization of the timeline and knowledge of the EEOC activity, noting, among other things, testimony that at least one decisionmaker learned of the pending EEOC complaint only after the reassignment decision. Even assuming knowledge at some earlier point, the Army contends that mere temporal proximity is insufficient at the pretext stage absent additional evidence undermining the credibility of its stated reason for the reassignment."

          "reasoning":"Summary judgment on discrimination claims is reviewed de novo, but on the record as properly constructed under Local Rule 56. The Army produced a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for Quintana\u2019s reassignment: two investigations documenting serious, long\u2011standing complaints about her management style and treatment of subordinates, leading two different commanders to conclude she should be removed from supervision. She was reassigned at the same pay and grade. Under McDonnell Douglas, the burden shifted to Quintana to show this explanation was pretext and that the real motive was age, race, or sex discrimination. Her challenges\u2014attacking the investigations as hearsay or \u2018fabricated,\u2019 pointing to her prior good performance, disagreement with the severity of discipline, and the fact that the second investigator did not specifically recommend reassignment\u2014do not under First Circuit law suffice to show that the employer did not honestly believe the stated reasons. The Army was entitled to rely on investigation results as evidence of its good\u2011faith belief, even if some underlying statements were hearsay, because they were offered to show the decisionmakers\u2019 state of mind. Moreover, any inference of discrimination is weakened by the fact that her duties were taken over by Hispanic women, one only about a year younger than she. The brief reference to a younger male who was merely considered or informally approached, but never actually installed as her replacement, is thin evidence of discriminatory animus and is outweighed by the undisputed investigative record. On these facts, a reasonable jury could not find that the articulated rationale was a sham masking age, race, or sex bias, so affirmance of summary judgment is likely."

The sticking point is causation and pretext. The record, as accepted by the district court, shows that concerns about her management predated the protected activity, that two investigations concluded she should be removed from supervision, and that a reassignment decision was contemplated in early 2017, months before the later stages of the EEOC matter became salient. Even crediting her contention that some supervisors learned of her EEOC complaint around July or August 2017, the decisive reassignment in November 2017 followed an existing, documented disciplinary trajectory. Temporal proximity alone, especially in the context of a long\u2011running investigation and earlier reassignment letter, is insufficient at the pretext stage in the First Circuit. Quintana offers no concrete evidence that the investigations were launched or manipulated in response to her EEOC activity, no evidence that similarly situated non\u2011complaining employees were treated more leniently, and no procedural irregularity that reasonably suggests retaliatory motive. On this record, no reasonable jury could find that the stated, investigation\u2011based justification was a pretext for retaliation, so summary judgment is properly affirmed."

The district court articulated specific, rule\u2011based reasons for deeming the Army\u2019s facts admitted and for discounting Quintana\u2019s defective submissions; that use of Local Rule 56 falls squarely within the court\u2019s discretion. Once the record is confined to properly supported facts, the Army offered a strong, consistent, non\u2011discriminatory and non\u2011retaliatory rationale grounded in two independent investigations and corroborated by multiple complaints. Quintana\u2019s rebuttal largely consists of speculation about fabrication, disagreement with management\u2019s disciplinary choices, and limited temporal proximity. She provided no robust comparator evidence, no significant procedural anomalies, and no direct or circumstantial proof tying the adverse action to her protected characteristics or protected activity. Given this evidentiary posture and prevailing First Circuit precedent on pretext and retaliation, the appellate court is very likely to affirm across all issues."

      },
      "factual_background":"Amanali Babwari worked as a clerk at the Pit Stop Grocery, a convenience store in Birmingham, Alabama. On the night of October 10, 2016, he worked the closing shift alone. He closed the store at around 11:00 p.m. and locked the front door. At that point, he was off the clock. His employer required him to park his car in an unlit corner of the store\u2019s parking lot next to a dumpster. After closing, he walked to that car. As he entered the vehicle, an unknown assailant approached from behind the dumpster and shot him. The assailant demanded that Babwari \"give [him] all [he] got,\" and Babwari handed over a bag containing approximately $100 in small bills. The assailant then shot him several more times and fled. Babwari was struck by at least nine bullets, managed to call 911, and was transported by ambulance to the hospital, where he remained for several weeks recovering from his injuries.\n\nPit Stop Grocery was insured under a State Farm general liability policy. That policy provided coverage for \"bodily injury\" caused by an \"occurrence,\" defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" The policy also contained exclusions, including for bodily injury that: (1) \"is expected or intended to cause harm as would be expected by a reasonable person\"; (2) \"is the result of willful and malicious, or criminal acts of the insured\"; (3) \"arises out of and in the course of\" employment by the insured or performing duties related to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business; and (4) \"arises out of any\" employment-related practices, policies, acts, or omissions.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Babwari sued his employer, Pit Stop, in Alabama state court alleging that Pit Stop failed to take reasonable security measures to protect him. He asserted claims for negligence and wantonness, and, in the alternative, a claim under the Alabama Employer\u2019s Liability Act, Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 25\u20136\u20131 through 25\u20136\u20134. State Farm initially defended Pit Stop under a reservation of rights, but later determined the policy did not provide coverage for Babwari\u2019s injuries and withdrew from the defense. Pit Stop and Babwari subsequently settled and jointly moved for entry of a consent judgment against Pit Stop in the amount of $877,659.66. The state court entered that consent judgment without specifying which of the three claims (negligence, wantonness, or Employer\u2019s Liability Act) formed the basis for Pit Stop\u2019s liability.\n\nAfter obtaining the consent judgment, Babwari filed a separate action against State Farm under Alabama\u2019s Direct-Action Statute, Ala. Code \u00a7 27\u201323\u20132. That statute permits a prevailing plaintiff to proceed against a defendant and its insurer to reach and apply any available insurance coverage to satisfy a judgment. State Farm\u2019s potential liability in this direct action turns on whether the Pit Stop policy provides coverage for Babwari\u2019s injuries, in light of the policy\u2019s definitions and exclusions.",

Code \u00a7\u00a7 25\u20136\u20131 to 25\u20136\u20134. After a consent judgment was entered against Pit Stop for $877,659.66 without allocation among the claims, Babwari then brought a separate state-court action against State Farm under Alabama\u2019s Direct-Action Statute, Ala. Code \u00a7 27\u201323\u20132, to compel State Farm, as Pit Stop\u2019s insurer, to satisfy the consent judgment.",
        "district_court_decision":"State Farm removed the direct-action coverage suit to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. Both parties moved for summary judgment. State Farm argued that the injuries were not covered because they did not constitute an \"occurrence\" under the policy, that four policy exclusions (intended\/expected injury, willful and malicious or criminal acts of the insured, the employer\u2019s liability exclusion, and employment-related practices exclusion) precluded coverage, and that Babwari could not establish coverage in any event because the consent judgment did not identify which of his three claims formed the basis for liability and at least the wantonness and Employer\u2019s Liability Act claims were excluded. Babwari argued that his injuries fell within the policy\u2019s coverage as an \"occurrence\" and that none of the exclusions applied.\n\nThe district court granted summary judgment in favor of Babwari. It interpreted the policy as providing coverage for injuries resulting from negligence but not for injuries resulting from wanton conduct. Reviewing the record from the underlying state proceeding, the court concluded there was no evidence that would support a finding that the store acted wantonly. By process of elimination, the court determined that negligence must have been the claim underlying the consent judgment and did not address whether the Employer\u2019s Liability Act claim could have been the basis for liability. The district court held that Babwari\u2019s injuries constituted an \"occurrence\" under the policy, determined that no exclusion\u2014including the employer\u2019s liability exclusion\u2014barred coverage, entered judgment for Babwari, and ordered State Farm to pay the $877,659.66 consent judgment plus $262,035.51 in pre-judgment interest.",

The district court inferred that negligence was necessarily the basis by reviewing the state-court record and deeming the wantonness claim unsupported, then simply disregarding the Employer\u2019s Liability Act claim.

Alabama decisions construe similar language to include injuries on employer\u2011maintained parking lots within a reasonable time and space before and after work. Here, Babwari had just finished his closing shift, locked the store, and was walking to the car his employer required him to park in a specific, employer\u2011designated area of the lot.

The causal \u2018arising out of\u2019 component is satisfied where the employment exposes the worker to the risk\u2014here, being required to park in an unlit corner near a dumpster, allegedly without adequate security measures. Alabama courts also commonly interpret identical exclusionary language in CGL policies in harmony with workers\u2019 compensation law to preserve the separation between CGL coverage and employers\u2019 liability\/workers\u2019 compensation coverage. The fact that the assailant was a third party with personal motives does not negate the employment nexus for purposes of this exclusion; workers\u2019 compensation concepts of compensability and fault allocation are broader questions than the narrow policy question of whether the injury meets the \u2018arising out of and in the course of\u2019 formulation. On de novo review, the stronger reading is that the exclusion applies and bars coverage for injuries like Babwari\u2019s that occur on employer premises, immediately after a shift, while the employee is using an employer\u2011required parking area.

The district court\u2019s inference that negligence must have been the basis rested on its own view of the sufficiency of the evidence regarding wantonness and, critically, ignored the Employer\u2019s Liability Act claim. Where multiple theories of liability\u2014some clearly excluded\u2014were actually pled and potentially support the judgment, and nothing in the judgment or underlying record cleanly allocates among them, Alabama insurance principles will not permit a court simply to presume that the judgment rests on the one potentially covered claim. That alone requires reversal of the grant of summary judgment to Babwari, because he has not definitively tied the judgment to a covered theory.\n\nSecond, even assuming the negligence theory could otherwise be covered, the employer\u2019s liability exclusion is written to parallel the workers\u2019 compensation \u2018arising out of and in the course of employment\u2019 standard, and Alabama caselaw makes clear that this formulation includes injuries on an employer\u2019s premises, in an employer\u2019s parking lot, immediately after work. The facts here\u2014end of shift, employer\u2011required parking space on employer property, and alleged lack of security\u2014closely match scenarios in which Alabama courts have found that injuries arise out of and in the course of employment. Construing the exclusion consistently with that body of law preserves the line between CGL coverage and workers\u2019 compensation\/employers\u2019 liability coverage. On those facts, the appellate court is likely to hold that the exclusion applies and thereby precludes coverage. \n\nAccordingly, the outcome is mixed at the issue level: the district court\u2019s \u2018occurrence\u2019 ruling is affirmed, but its allocation reasoning and its rejection of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion are reversed. Because either of those two reversals is independently dispositive of coverage, the practical overall result is that State Farm is not obligated to pay the consent judgment or prejudgment interest, and the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Babwari will not stand."

      "factual_background":"289 Kilvert, LLC is a Rhode Island-registered company with its principal place of business in Rhode Island. It purchased a commercial property located at 289 Kilvert Street in Warwick, Rhode Island, and in doing so acquired the rights and interests under an existing telecommunications tower lease for that property. SBC Tower Holdings LLC, a Delaware company with its principal place of business in Texas, had been leasing the telecommunications tower on the premises for a number of years prior to 289 Kilvert\u2019s acquisition of the property and lease rights.\n\nAfter acquiring the lease rights, 289 Kilvert claimed that SBC Tower breached the terms of the lease. The asserted breach related to rental payments allegedly owed by SBC Tower under revenue-sharing provisions of the lease. Specifically, 289 Kilvert alleged that SBC Tower was obligated to pay the landlord fifty percent of the payments SBC Tower received from up to six subleases of the tower, with a minimum of $800 per month for each such sublease, and that this obligation extended over more than twenty years. 289 Kilvert further alleged that SBC Tower had failed to make these required payments, resulting in substantial unpaid rent for the use and occupation of the property.\n\nThe lease contained a choice-of-law provision stating that the agreement would be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the law of the State of Rhode Island. A fourth amendment to the lease also included a choice-of-law provision specifying that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the original lease and the amendment, the lease and the amendment would be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the state or commonwealth in which the leased premises is situated, without regard to that jurisdiction\u2019s conflict-of-laws provisions. 289 Kilvert maintains that the parties\u2019 reliance on Rhode Island law, combined with Rhode Island statutes governing landlord-tenant jurisdiction, has consequences for the proper forum for litigating their dispute.",

It did not contest that the statutory requirements for federal diversity jurisdiction were satisfied, but argued that removal was unavailable because Rhode Island law, specifically R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 8-8-3(a)(2), gives the Rhode Island district court exclusive original jurisdiction over all actions between landlords and tenants and other actions for possession of premises. 289 Kilvert further contended that, by including a Rhode Island choice-of-law clause in the lease (and its amendment), the parties had agreed to be governed by Rhode Island law, which in turn required that landlord-tenant actions be filed and maintained exclusively in Rhode Island district court. The federal district court agreed with 289 Kilvert\u2019s view that Rhode Island law mandated the state district court as the proper court for this action and concluded that removal was improper. On that basis, the federal court granted 289 Kilvert\u2019s motion to remand the case to the Rhode Island district court, characterizing its decision as an issue of enforcing what the parties had agreed to, rather than as a question of its own subject-matter jurisdiction under federal law.",

On that understanding, SBC Tower\u2019s attempt to remove the action to federal court is inconsistent with the parties\u2019 contractual commitment and with the Rhode Island statutory allocation of jurisdiction."

In 2012, the Hotel Trades Council of New York Local 6 (the \"Union\") became the new union representing Hotel employees. At that time, the Union and the Hotel executed a Memorandum of Agreement. Under that agreement, \"[c]urrent [e]mployees\" were given the right, \"at [their] sole discretion, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Industry Pension plan gives a presentation,\" to choose either to participate in the Hotel\u2019s existing 401(k) retirement plan or to be covered by the Industry Pension Plan. The agreement provided that any employee who did not communicate a choice within that thirty-day window would be placed into the Industry Pension Plan by default.\n\nAccording to Scales, he was on layoff during the thirty-day election period and was not informed of that window. The thirty-day period lapsed while he was laid off. When Scales later returned to work, the Hotel gave him a form to select his preferred retirement plan, and he chose the employer\u2019s 401(k) plan. Around 2018, Scales learned that, despite his election of the 401(k) plan upon returning to work, his retirement plan had been \"defaulted into\" the Industry Pension Plan while he was laid off.\n\nAfter discovering this, Scales filled out a complaint form seeking assistance from the Union. He alleges that he then waited \"weeks upon weeks\" before being told that the Union could not assist him. The Union explained that it could not help him because the Hotel\u2019s 401(k) plan predated the Union\u2019s representation. The Union did not investigate or arbitrate the matter on his behalf at that time. As a result of the default into the Industry Pension Plan, Scales alleges he was unable to access his 401(k) funds \"because the [Union] pension is fixed and [he] cannot withdraw money from it.\"",

On appeal he described his theory as encompassing: (1) a \"hybrid\" claim under the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) and National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), consisting of breach of the collective bargaining agreement by the Hotel and breach of the duty of fair representation by the Union; (2) a separate claim for breach of the collective bargaining agreement directly against the Union; and (3) a state-law claim for conversion based on his inability to access funds he believed should be in a 401(k) plan.",

The Union then moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court granted the Union\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that Scales had failed to plead arbitrary, discriminatory, or bad-faith conduct sufficient to state a duty-of-fair-representation claim, that he had not identified contractual language creating enforceable obligations running from the Union to him under a breach-of-contract theory, and that his proposed conversion claim under New York law was not distinct from his contract-based theory.

Pro se complaints are construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments they suggest, and courts may consider submissions beyond the complaint to determine what claims are presented by an uncounseled party. For a hybrid LMRA\/NLRA claim, a plaintiff must prove both that the employer breached a collective bargaining agreement (governed by LMRA \u00a7 301) and that the union breached its duty of fair representation (implied from NLRA \u00a7 9(a)). A union breaches its duty of fair representation when its conduct toward a member is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith, and the wrongful conduct must cause the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. A union\u2019s conduct is arbitrary only if, in light of the circumstances at the time, it is so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational, and bad faith requires improper intent, purpose, or motive. To assert a breach-of-contract claim directly against a union based on a collective bargaining agreement or related agreement, the employee must point to contract language specifically indicating an intent to create obligations enforceable by individual employees against the union.

          "Scales argues that the district court wrongly concluded that he failed to state a claim. He contends that, when his second amended complaint is read liberally together with several letters and submissions he filed pro se, the pleadings plausibly allege a hybrid claim under the LMRA and NLRA: namely, that the Hotel breached the applicable collective bargaining agreement by defaulting his retirement participation into the Industry Pension Plan while he was on layoff and that the Union breached its duty of fair representation by failing to protect his interests and effectively pursue his grievance concerning the misplacement of his retirement contributions.",
          "He further contends that his filings support an additional, distinct claim for breach of contract directly against the Union based on the Memorandum of Agreement. In his view, that agreement imposed on the Union a contractual duty to notify employees, including those on layoff, about the thirty-day election period for choosing between the 401(k) plan and the Industry Pension Plan, and the Union\u2019s failure to do so constitutes a breach enforceable by him as an individual employee.",
          "Scales also asserts that the facts alleged in his filings support a separate state-law conversion claim. He argues that the wrongful default of his retirement funds into the Industry Pension Plan, and the resulting inability to access funds he believed should be in a 401(k) account, amount to an unauthorized exercise of control over his property interests that is wrongful independent of any contractual breach.",
          "With respect to the duty-of-fair-representation aspect of his claim, Scales maintains that the district court failed adequately to consider certain filings which, he argues, show arbitrary and bad-faith conduct by the Union. In particular, he contends that the law firm that represented his interests in the arbitration simultaneously opposed him in the federal litigation, which he characterizes as sabotage and as evidence of the Union acting against his interests in an arbitrary or bad-faith manner.",
          "On the appointment-of-counsel issue, Scales argues that the district court abused its discretion by repeatedly denying his motions for pro bono counsel. He maintains that his case had sufficient merit to satisfy the Hodge threshold, that he lacked the legal training to present and develop his hybrid statutory, contract, and conversion theories effectively, and that appointed counsel would have assisted in clarifying his claims and marshaling the necessary facts and legal arguments."

In its view, the factual allegations concerning the Union\u2019s response to his inquiry and its later pursuit of arbitration on his behalf do not show conduct that was irrational, discriminatory, or driven by improper motive, nor do they demonstrate that any Union conduct caused his alleged injury.",

          "Regarding the separate breach-of-contract theory against the Union, the Union argues that the Memorandum of Agreement contains no language indicating an intent to create contractual obligations enforceable by individual employees against the Union itself, particularly no specific obligation requiring the Union to notify employees on layoff of the thirty-day retirement-plan election period. Absent such language, Scales cannot assert a contract claim against the Union based on that agreement.",
          "On the conversion claim, the Union argues that under New York law, conversion cannot be based solely on an alleged breach of contract and must rest on a distinct, independent tort. Because Scales\u2019s conversion theory rests on the same alleged facts and duties as his contract-based complaints concerning his retirement-plan election and the handling of his contributions, the claim does not state a separate, cognizable tort.",

It maintains that the court correctly applied the Hodge framework by first assessing whether Scales\u2019s claims were likely to be of substance and reasonably concluding that they were not.

          "reasoning":"Taking the pro se pleadings liberally and all facts as true, the allegations do not plausibly state (a) a breach of the duty of fair representation, (b) a contract claim directly enforceable against the Union, or (c) a distinct tort of conversion.\n\n(a) Hybrid LMRA\/NLRA claim \/ duty of fair representation: Even crediting that the Hotel may have breached the agreement by defaulting Scales into the pension while he was laid off, the union-side element fails. His factual allegations are that (1) he waited some weeks for a response, (2) the Union told him it could not help because the 401(k) predated its representation, and (3) later, the Union did, in fact, take his benefits dispute to arbitration. Those facts, as pled, show at most delay, a possibly mistaken explanation, and a later effort to pursue his grievance. Under established duty-of-fair-representation doctrine, such conduct does not plausibly rise to being \u2018so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be irrational,\u2019 nor does it show discriminatory or bad-faith motive. His additional allegation that the same law firm represented him in arbitration and represented the Union in federal court, without more, is not enough to show improper motive or sabotage, particularly since the firm was the Union\u2019s counsel throughout. Absent well-pleaded facts of arbitrary, discriminatory, or bad-faith conduct causing his specific injury (the original default into the pension plan), the hybrid claim fails as a matter of law, and dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate.\n\n(b) Direct breach-of-contract claim against the Union: The Memorandum of Agreement is a union\u2013employer agreement. To sue the Union directly for breach, an individual employee must point to contract language that specifically creates obligations running from the Union to individual employees. The description of the MOA in the record speaks to employees\u2019 options and the default rule but does not identify any term in which the Union undertakes a direct, enforceable obligation to notify individual employees\u2014let alone those on layoff\u2014about the thirty-day election period. In the absence of such language, courts in this circuit routinely hold that a union cannot be sued in contract by an individual member on a collective agreement. At most, any alleged failure by the Union to act on his behalf is governed by the duty-of-fair-representation framework, which, as noted, is not plausibly pleaded here. The district court therefore correctly concluded that no standalone contractual obligation by the Union to Scales was identified.\n\n(c) Conversion: Under New York law, conversion cannot merely restate a contract or statutory-duty theory. Scales\u2019 conversion claim arises from the same asserted wrong\u2014the handling and placement of his retirement contributions\u2014and turns on whether he had contractual or collectively bargained rights to have those funds treated as 401(k) assets rather than pension contributions. He pleads no distinct possessory right in specific, identifiable funds that the Union itself wrongfully took or exercised dominion over, separate from the bargained-for retirement structure. Nor does he allege an independent tort duty owed by the Union apart from the contractual\/collective context. Because the conversion claim simply repackages his contract\/representation grievances, the district court properly dismissed it as noncognizable. \n\nGiven the high bar for duty-of-fair-representation claims and the absence of contract language or a distinct tort theory, the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is likely to be affirmed in full."

That conclusion is well within the range of permissible decisions, particularly in a duty-of-fair-representation\/\u00a7 301 context where the substantive standards are stringent and the alleged facts are thin.\n\nThe record indicates that the court understood and applied the correct legal standard and focused on the absence of likely merit. Once it reasonably determined that threshold was not met, it was not required to weigh the remaining Hodge factors. The case turned on legal sufficiency under Rule 12(b)(6) rather than complex factual disputes requiring extensive investigation or cross-examination, and Scales was able to articulate his narrative and theories in multiple filings that the court read liberally. Under these circumstances, refusing to request pro bono counsel does not reflect legal error, clearly erroneous factual findings, or a decision outside the permissible range. The denial of counsel is therefore likely to be affirmed."

These are common grounds on which similar pro se union-related complaints are routinely affirmed dismissed. \n\nGiven that low substantive likelihood of success, the district court\u2019s repeated denials of pro bono counsel comfortably fall within its discretion under Hodge: the claims lacked likely merit, the issues were not unusually complex for federal courts, and Scales was able to present them coherently. There is no indication of misapplication of the legal standard. Accordingly, the most plausible appellate outcome is an across-the-board affirmance."

        "appellee":"Perry Cline \u2013 plaintiff, an Oklahoma royalty owner, serving as class representative on behalf of himself and similarly situated owners"
      },
      "factual_background":"The dispute concerns the timing and interest components of payments of oil proceeds under Oklahoma\u2019s Production Revenue Standards Act (PRSA), Okla. Stat. tit. 52, \u00a7\u00a7 570.1\u2013570.15. The PRSA regulates the marketing, sale, and production of hydrocarbons from Oklahoma wells and sets strict deadlines for distributing proceeds from the sale of oil and gas to owners, including royalty and working interest owners. For oil proceeds, the statute generally requires that payment commence within six months after the date of the first sale and thereafter no later than the last day of the second succeeding month after the end of the month in which production is sold. If proceeds are not paid within those time limits, the unpaid portion must earn statutory interest, ordinarily at 12% per annum, compounded annually, unless a reduced rate applies because of a legitimate question about the owner\u2019s marketable title. The PRSA places these obligations on \"first purchasers\" or other holders of proceeds. Sunoco is a \"first purchaser\" of oil extracted from Oklahoma wells; it is not itself a producer and does not hold leases with individual landowners. Operators extract the oil and convey it to Sunoco under contracts. Sunoco then pays the persons and entities it regards as owners of the proceeds, based on its business records and information from operators. Sunoco has contracts with thousands of producers and, since 2006, has paid royalty proceeds for production from over 20,000 properties to more than 100,000 owners. The named plaintiff, Perry Cline, is an Oklahoma farmer and landowner who holds royalty interests in three Oklahoma oil wells. As a royalty owner, he is entitled to a share of the proceeds from oil sold from those wells. Under the PRSA, \"owners\" include persons or governmental entities with a legal interest in the mineral acreage under a well that entitles them to production or to the proceeds. Cline alleged that Sunoco, despite being obligated by statute to pay interest automatically on any untimely proceeds payments, followed a uniform practice of not paying PRSA interest unless an owner specifically requested it. According to the district court\u2019s factual findings, Sunoco\u2019s practice resulted in millions of late payments of oil proceeds for which statutory interest was not paid, even though Sunoco had already acknowledged the owners\u2019 entitlement to the underlying proceeds by paying the principal. Sunoco\u2019s representative testified that Sunoco had already paid the principal proceeds directly to each class member or, if the owner could not be located, to a state unclaimed property fund. For owners who could not be located or clearly identified, Sunoco transmitted proceeds to unclaimed property agencies in states such as Oklahoma and Texas, which hold those funds in custodial trust until the rightful owners claim them. The case record reflects that Sunoco kept and used internal data identifying the date of sale, the date of payment, and the amount of proceeds for each owner, but it did not contemporaneously calculate or pay statutory interest on late payments unless specifically requested. Cline\u2019s expert, certified public accountant Barbara Ley, used data provided by Sunoco to build a database that identified whether each payment was late and calculated the amount of interest due under the PRSA for each owner, accounting for sale dates, payment dates, amounts, and the statutory interest rules.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In 2017, Perry Cline filed a putative class action in Oklahoma state court against Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) and Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals L.P. He asserted state-law claims on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated owners, principally: (1) violation of Oklahoma\u2019s Production Revenue Standards Act (PRSA), predicated on Sunoco\u2019s alleged failure to pay statutory interest automatically on untimely proceeds payments; and (2) common-law fraud, alleging Sunoco knowingly withheld statutory interest and misled owners (including through standardized check stubs) about amounts owed.",
        "district_court_decision":"Sunoco removed the action to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma under the Class Action Fairness Act. The case progressed slowly until 2019, when Cline moved for class certification. In October 2019, the district court certified a Rule 23(b)(3) damages class for both the PRSA and fraud claims. The certified class, as ultimately defined, consisted of all non-excluded persons or entities who (1) received 'Untimely Payments' from Sunoco (or its designees) for oil proceeds from Oklahoma wells, and (2) had not already been paid statutory interest on those untimely payments, during a specified five-year limitations period. 'Untimely Payments' were defined by reference to PRSA\u2019s statutory payment deadlines, and certain categories such as minimum-pay amounts, prior period adjustments, and pass-through payments were excluded. In granting certification, the court found numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy, predominance, and superiority satisfied, relying heavily on evidence of Sunoco\u2019s uniform practice of not paying PRSA interest absent demand and on Ley\u2019s damages model, which the court found capable of calculating class-wide damages with common proof. The court also rejected Sunoco\u2019s arguments that individualized reliance defeated certification of the fraud claim, concluding that fraud could be shown using standardized check stubs, and it determined the class was ascertainable based on Sunoco\u2019s own records and Ley\u2019s methodology. The district court then set a discovery cutoff of October 18, 2019, and a trial date of December 16, 2019. On December 10, 2019, the court granted the class\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on class-wide liability under the PRSA, holding that PRSA requires first purchasers like Sunoco to pay statutory interest automatically when payments are late and that Sunoco had admitted it did not do so unless an owner requested interest. This ruling established Sunoco\u2019s liability under the PRSA to each class member; Sunoco did not subsequently appeal this liability determination. A four-day bench trial commenced on December 16, 2019, covering damages on the PRSA claim and liability and damages on the fraud claim. Cline presented expert testimony from Ley regarding damages; the court found her methodology thorough and credible and concluded Sunoco agreed that her underlying data (sale dates, payment dates, amounts) reliably reflected its records. After trial, the district court struck Sunoco\u2019s damages expert, Eric Krause, as untimely and unreliable, leaving Sunoco without an expert or competing damages model. In August 2020, the court issued a detailed opinion finding liability for the class on the PRSA claim and no liability on the fraud claim. It awarded actual damages to the class based on unpaid statutory interest on more than $1.5 million in late proceeds, with interest at 12% compounded annually through a specified cutoff date, plus additional amounts as prejudgment interest accruing post-trial under the PRSA formula. The court also awarded punitive damages to the class, concluding that Sunoco\u2019s conduct met the relevant Oklahoma standards for a punitive award. The total judgment initially exceeded $103 million in actual damages (including accrued interest) and $75 million in punitive damages. The district court made specific factual findings that Sunoco had engaged in litigation tactics that delayed the case and complicated discovery, including sending an unsolicited interest check to Cline and later arguing it extinguished his standing, filing a motion to \"clarify\" the class definition that the court viewed as an attempt to shrink the class, delaying review of its files until after class certification and trial setting, and belatedly producing large volumes of data after the plaintiff\u2019s expert deadline and after discovery had closed.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Prior to the present appeal, Sunoco sought multiple interlocutory appeals which were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In a prior appeal (Cline III), the Tenth Circuit accepted review of the district court\u2019s initial plan of allocation and held that the plan did not adequately specify individual damage awards for owners tied to two \"undivided\" accounts associated with unlocated class members. The case was remanded for the district court to revise its allocation plan. On remand, the district court entered an amended plan of allocation and an updated damages order. These orders provided instructions to the settlement administrator regarding the amount of damages to be paid to each identified class member and specified how amounts corresponding to unlocated owners were to be paid into state unclaimed property funds. Sunoco did not challenge the amended allocation plan in the present appeal. After resolving post-trial motions, the district court in October 2023 entered an amended damages award updating the actual damages to approximately $103.87 million, accounting for compound interest accruing after trial. Final judgment, including the punitive damages award, was entered on October 19, 2023. Sunoco then filed the present appeal. In this appeal, Sunoco challenges: (1) the district court\u2019s order granting and maintaining class certification (including predominance, ascertainability, and related Rule 23 requirements); (2) the Article III standing of certain class members, particularly those whose payments or additional interest were directed to state unclaimed property funds because Sunoco\u2019s records did not identify or locate them; (3) the scope and calculation of prejudgment interest included in the actual damages award under the PRSA, including whether interest may be compounded and continue accruing after Sunoco paid the principal proceeds; and (4) the propriety and legality of the punitive damages award under Oklahoma law. Sunoco does not appeal the district court\u2019s determination of Sunoco\u2019s class-wide liability on the PRSA claim or the amended plan of allocation specifying individual damage amounts, but it contests the legal basis and scope of the damages and class mechanisms that support the final judgment."

          "Class certification \/ predominance: Sunoco contends that individualized issues overwhelm common questions, defeating predominance under Rule 23(b)(3). It argues that determining whether and when interest is owed requires individualized inquiries into each owner\u2019s marketable title, ownership history, lease and title issues, and the reason for each late payment, which vary widely across thousands of wells and more than 50,000 owners. Sunoco maintains that questions about when proceeds became legally owed, whether title was marketable at relevant times, and how statutory exceptions apply cannot be adjudicated with generalized proof. Sunoco also argues that common-law fraud claims inherently require proof of individual reliance, which purportedly precludes class-wide resolution.",
          "Ascertainability \/ administrative feasibility: Sunoco argues that not all class members can be identified from its records and that the class is therefore not ascertainable. It emphasizes that many records are incomplete or scattered across multiple databases, that some accounts are in the names of operators or in pooled or \"undivided\" accounts with no clear mapping to specific individual owners, and that identifying all owners would require extensive, individualized title work and record matching that is allegedly administratively infeasible. Sunoco urges adoption of a rigorous ascertainability standard that includes an administrative feasibility component, under which the district court\u2019s certification decision could not stand.",
          "Standing of class members with unclaimed property: Sunoco argues that some class members lack Article III standing because their proceeds and associated interest have been transferred to state unclaimed property funds, and Sunoco no longer holds the funds. It asserts that owners who have not been located or personally appeared have not suffered a cognizable injury or that any injury is speculative or not fairly traceable to Sunoco once the funds have been turned over to the state. Sunoco also claims that there must be a \"flesh and blood\" person identified to support standing and questions whether owners associated only with account numbers or unclaimed property entries meet this requirement. In a footnote, it suggests that any claim to interest on funds now held in unclaimed property funds is not prudentially ripe.",
          "Marketable title and statutory interest rate: Sunoco maintains that many late payments were excusable or subject to a reduced interest rate due to marketable title issues. It asserts that under Oklahoma law, owners bear the burden of demonstrating marketable title and that questions about whether title was marketable at the time of each payment are inherently individualized. Sunoco contends that the district court improperly shifted the burden onto Sunoco to disprove marketable title problems across the class and failed to account for the statutory 6% rate applicable when proceeds are withheld for legitimate marketable-title reasons for pre\u20112018 payments, and lower rates thereafter.",
          "Prejudgment interest calculation: Sunoco challenges the court\u2019s interpretation of the PRSA\u2019s interest provision, arguing that \"until the day paid\" means interest accrues only until Sunoco pays the underlying late proceeds, not until it later pays statutory interest. Sunoco contends that once principal proceeds are paid, interest should stop and cannot continue to compound solely because statutory interest remains unpaid. It argues that the district court\u2019s award of interest through the date of its trial opinion and beyond improperly treated PRSA interest as open-ended prejudgment interest and effectively imposed \"extra-statutory\" interest beyond what the PRSA and ELRA permit. Sunoco cites the Energy Litigation Reform Act for the proposition that actual damages for late payments are limited to proceeds plus PRSA interest, which it interprets as ending upon payment of proceeds, and asserts that no additional prejudgment interest on unpaid interest is authorized. It also contends that any increase in interest during the period between trial and final allocation or judgment is inequitable, particularly where appellate review of the allocation plan contributed to the delay.",
          "Punitive damages: Sunoco argues that punitive damages are unavailable on a PRSA claim construed as a breach-of-contract action, citing Oklahoma statutes and case law that limit punitive damages to non-contractual obligations or independent torts. It points out that the class did not prevail on the fraud claim, the only tort theory pled, and therefore there is no independent willful tort on which to base punitive damages. Sunoco maintains that the ELRA does not convert PRSA violations into torts or authorize punitive damages absent proof and a finding of the specific, heightened mental state directed at withholding proceeds as required by \u00a7 903. It contends that the district court misapplied Oklahoma law by awarding punitive damages based solely on Sunoco\u2019s failure to pay statutory interest and its alleged litigation conduct, not on any separate tort that meets the state\u2019s standards.",
          "Scheduling and discovery: Sunoco criticizes the district court\u2019s decision to accelerate the discovery cutoff and trial date after the case had languished, arguing that the compressed schedule impaired its ability to fully develop its defenses and expert testimony, particularly on damages and title issues. It attributes the lack of a defense expert at trial and difficulties in responding to class-wide damages theories partly to the court\u2019s scheduling decisions, though it did not formally appeal the scheduling orders themselves.",
          "Affirmative defenses and individual issues: Sunoco asserts that affirmative defenses such as statute of limitations, title disputes, indemnity agreements, and other contractual or equitable defenses vary from owner to owner and therefore undermine predominance and class cohesiveness. It argues that these defenses necessitate individualized litigation that is incompatible with class treatment."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "Uniform Sunoco practice and common issues: Cline and the class argue that Sunoco\u2019s liability under the PRSA turns on a single, common issue: Sunoco\u2019s uniform corporate policy and practice of not paying statutory interest automatically on late proceeds payments unless and until an owner specifically demanded it. They point to Sunoco\u2019s admissions and business records to show that this practice applied to all wells and owners in Oklahoma where Sunoco was the first purchaser. They contend that this common course of conduct supplies the \"glue\" for class-wide adjudication and that common questions about PRSA obligations, the need for a demand, and Sunoco\u2019s practice predominate, while any variations among owners or wells are limited to the calculation of damages.",
          "Expert damages model and class manageability: The class relies on the testimony and model of their expert, Barbara Ley, to show that damages can be calculated on a class-wide basis using Sunoco\u2019s own data. They argue that Ley\u2019s methodology identifies each owner, each payment, whether it was late, the applicable interest rate, and the total interest due for each late payment, thereby allowing precise computation of individual damages without individualized mini-trials. They note that the district court found Ley credible and that Sunoco agreed her underlying data accurately reflected key variables, emphasizing that Sunoco offered no admissible counter-expert or alternative damages model at trial.",
          "Predominance and individual issues: The class argues that any individual questions, such as minor variations in timing of payments, potential title issues, or lease-specific defenses, go only to the quantum of damages and do not overcome the central, class-wide issue of Sunoco\u2019s failure to pay PRSA interest. They point to Tenth Circuit precedents recognizing that individual damages calculations do not defeat predominance where liability is established with common proof, and they argue that Sunoco failed to identify any concrete examples where marketable title or other individualized issues legitimately justified nonpayment of interest among the millions of late payments at issue.",
          "Marketable title as an affirmative defense: The class contends that marketable title issues were not legitimately in dispute for class members because Sunoco had already decided to pay principal proceeds to each of them, which implies that Sunoco had determined they were entitled to those proceeds. They argue that any marketable title defense is an affirmative defense for which Sunoco bears the burden of proof, and that Sunoco\u2019s own expert on marketable title examined no individual titles and could not identify a single instance in which title was unmarketable or legitimately in question among the class members. Accordingly, they assert that marketable title does not inject individualized issues sufficient to defeat class treatment.",
          "Ascertainability: The class argues that the class definition is based on clear, objective criteria (receipt of an untimely payment without statutory interest) and that class members can be identified using Sunoco\u2019s data and standard record-matching processes. They emphasize that any administrative difficulty associated with locating all owners\u2014particularly where Sunoco\u2019s own record-keeping is deficient\u2014does not defeat ascertainability or Rule 23(b)(3) superiority. They maintain that defendants should not benefit from poor or fragmented record-keeping by using it to avoid class liability, and that courts routinely certify classes even when determining membership requires review and reconciliation of voluminous records.",
          "Standing and unclaimed property funds: The class argues that every class member suffered a concrete monetary injury when Sunoco failed to include PRSA interest with late proceeds payments, whether or not the member can presently be located. They contend that Sunoco\u2019s payment of principal (and later of interest) into state unclaimed property funds does not extinguish class members\u2019 injuries because those states hold the funds in trust on behalf of owners, who can later claim them. They maintain that under custodial unclaimed property schemes, payment to the state effectively constitutes payment to an agent or trustee for the owner, so the owner remains the injured party and retains a legally protected interest in the funds and in any interest that should have been, but was not, paid. They also argue that Sunoco cannot rely on its own deficient records or failure to locate owners as a basis for contesting standing.",
          "Prejudgment interest under PRSA: The class contends that under the PRSA\u2019s plain language and Oklahoma\u2019s statutory definition of compound interest, unpaid interest becomes part of the principal and itself bears interest until fully paid. They argue that \"until the day paid\" refers to the day when the holder pays all amounts due under the PRSA\u2014both principal proceeds and all accrued statutory interest\u2014and that interest continues to accrue and compound annually until then. They maintain that PRSA interest is a form of prejudgment interest under Oklahoma law, part of the compensatory damages necessary to make royalty owners whole for the loss of use of their money, and that Oklahoma courts have treated it as such. They argue that the district court therefore correctly allowed interest to continue accruing under the PRSA formula through the date of its trial opinion (and then through the amended judgment), and that no equitable exception permits stopping accrual earlier based on case delays or appellate proceedings. They further argue that the ELRA\u2019s confirmation that actual damages are limited to proceeds plus PRSA interest simply incorporates the PRSA interest regime and does not impose a cap that would forbid accrual until all amounts are paid.",
          "Punitive damages and ELRA: The class argues that while PRSA claims are rooted in contract, Oklahoma\u2019s Energy Litigation Reform Act specifically provides for punitive damages in late-payment cases when a defendant intentionally withholds proceeds with actual, knowing, and willful intent to deceive or to deprive owners of proceeds, and that this specific statutory scheme should control over general restrictions on punitive damages in contract cases. They contend that the PRSA and ELRA together create a specialized remedial framework for oil and gas disputes that includes the possibility of punitive damages in appropriate cases and that Oklahoma law permits combining PRSA claims with tort claims like fraud or deceit in a single action. They maintain that Sunoco\u2019s alleged knowing and willful decision not to pay statutory interest, coupled with its broader litigation and payment practices, satisfied the ELRA\u2019s punitive damages standard, arguing that Sunoco\u2019s conduct went beyond a mere contractual breach and constituted intentional wrongdoing aimed at retaining proceeds-related benefits.",
          "Response to scheduling and discovery complaints: The class responds that Sunoco never sought formal modification of the scheduling or discovery orders and that the district court made detailed factual findings rejecting Sunoco\u2019s assertions of prejudice. They highlight the court\u2019s findings that Sunoco delayed gathering and producing relevant data for years, then produced massive data dumps after the plaintiff\u2019s expert deadline and discovery cutoff, and that Sunoco\u2019s own strategic litigation choices, not the court\u2019s scheduling decisions, left it without a damages expert at trial. The class argues that these unchallenged findings undermine Sunoco\u2019s attempt to attribute the outcome to procedural unfairness rather than to its own decisions.",
          "Treatment of affirmative defenses: The class contends that potential affirmative defenses such as statute of limitations, marketable title variations, and indemnity agreements either lack evidentiary support in this record or go only to individual damage amounts, not to the common liability question under the PRSA. They argue that under prevailing class action doctrine, the existence of individualized affirmative defenses against some class members does not bar certification where a predominant, common liability issue can be resolved on a class-wide basis, particularly when courts have procedural tools to address any remaining individualized questions after a class-wide liability determination."

          "reasoning":"The district court carefully applied Rule 23(a) and 23(b)(3), anchored predominance on Sunoco\u2019s uniform no\u2011interest\u2011unless\u2011demanded policy, and relied on a common, data\u2011driven damages model that Sunoco\u2019s own data supported. Individual variations (marketable title, defenses, timing nuances) go at most to damages or to a limited set of transactions and do not overwhelm the common liability question already resolved on a class\u2011wide basis. Sunoco produced no concrete, record\u2011supported showing that marketable\u2011title or other defenses would require thousands of mini\u2011trials; its own marketable\u2011title expert identified no specific unmarketable titles. Under Tenth Circuit class-action precedent, individualized damage calculations and scattered defenses do not defeat predominance where liability is established with common proof. As to ascertainability, the class is defined by objective criteria tied to Sunoco\u2019s own payment records; the Tenth Circuit does not treat administrative feasibility as a separate, dispositive prerequisite. The district court\u2019s manageability and superiority findings were well within the range of reasonable choices. Any earlier class certification of the fraud claim is now effectively harmless, because the class lost on fraud at trial and Sunoco does not identify any ongoing prejudice tied to that aspect of certification. There is no showing that the court\u2019s Rule 23 analysis fell outside its permissible discretion."

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"All class members suffered the same concrete monetary injury: Sunoco\u2019s failure to pay statutory PRSA interest contemporaneously with late proceeds. That injury exists whether the money is temporarily in Sunoco\u2019s hands or later in a state unclaimed\u2011property fund. Under custodial unclaimed\u2011property statutes, the state takes custody as a trustee or bailee; ownership and entitlement to principal and interest remain with the missing or unlocated owner. Thus the injury (underpayment of what the PRSA requires) is fairly traceable to Sunoco\u2019s past failure to pay interest and remains redressable by a judgment directing Sunoco to pay the missing amounts (either directly to identified owners or into the custodial funds for their benefit). Article III does not require each absent class member to be presently identified and located by name, so long as there are real persons or entities with legal rights to the proceeds and interest. The record shows that such owners exist (they are the beneficial owners of the unclaimed\u2011property accounts); Sunoco\u2019s inability or unwillingness to match them to current contact information does not erase their injury. Sunoco\u2019s prudential ripeness argument was underdeveloped and properly treated as waived. On de novo review, the inclusion of owners whose funds went into unclaimed\u2011property accounts is consistent with modern standing doctrine for monetary injuries."

        "issue_3":{
          "standard_of_review":"de novo",
          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"The PRSA explicitly provides that late proceeds \u2018shall earn interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum to be compounded annually \u2026 until the day paid.\u2019 Oklahoma law defines compound interest as interest that, once due, is added to principal and itself bears interest. Reading these provisions together, and in harmony with Oklahoma precedent treating PRSA interest as prejudgment, compensatory interest, the natural construction is that interest runs\u2014and compounds\u2014until all sums required under the statute are paid: principal plus the accumulated statutory interest. \u2018Day paid\u2019 therefore means the day when the full PRSA obligation (principal and interest) is satisfied, not merely the day when principal alone is transmitted. Stopping interest at the date of late\u2011principal payment would render \u2018compounded annually\u2019 largely inoperative in many late\u2011payment scenarios and would undercompensate owners, contrary to the legislature\u2019s evident intent to strengthen mineral owners\u2019 rights and ensure they receive the time value of their money. Consistent with this reading, the district court properly allowed PRSA interest to continue accruing and compounding post\u2011trial until the date specified in the amended damages order. Because PRSA interest is substantive, prejudgment interest under Oklahoma law, a federal court sitting in diversity must apply it through the date of judgment; delay caused by litigation or an earlier appeal does not provide a judicial basis for truncating a mandatory statutory interest period. The ELRA\u2019s damages limitation to \u2018proceeds\u2019 plus interest \u2018as provided in the PRSA\u2019 simply incorporates this statutory interest regime; it does not cap or terminate interest earlier than PRSA\u2019s \u2018until the day paid\u2019 language. Nor does it forbid interest on interest where the statute itself mandates compounding. On de novo review, the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the PRSA interest provisions, including accrual past principal payment and past trial up to judgment, are faithful to the statutory text and controlling Oklahoma authorities."

          "standard_of_review":"de novo",
          "prediction":"REVERSE",
          "reasoning":"Oklahoma law, as construed in cases like Purcell, Krug, Base, and Hebble, treats PRSA claims as contractual in nature (ex contractu), and the 12% PRSA interest as part of the contractual remedy, not a punitive penalty. The class prevailed solely on the PRSA claim and lost on its independent tort (fraud) claim; thus there is no separate tort judgment that could support punitive damages under the usual \u00a7 9.1 framework. The ELRA allows punitive damages in late\u2011payment disputes only upon a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the holder failed to pay \u2018proceeds\u2019 with an actual, knowing, and willful intent to deceive or to deprive the person known or believed to be entitled to those proceeds. The wrong defined in \u00a7 903 is the intentional failure to pay proceeds themselves, not the failure to pay statutory interest after proceeds are paid. Here, Sunoco\u2019s uniform practice was to pay principal proceeds (or to remit them to unclaimed\u2011property funds) and withhold statutory interest unless demanded. That conduct violates the PRSA\u2019s interest requirement but does not fit the ELRA\u2019s narrow punitive\u2011damages trigger, which focuses on intentional nonpayment of proceeds. The district court\u2019s punitive\u2011damages award rested on Sunoco\u2019s interest\u2011withholding policy and litigation behavior, not on a finding that Sunoco knowingly and willfully failed to pay the underlying proceeds with the specific intent \u00a7 903 requires. Harmonizing the PRSA, ELRA, and \u00a7 9.1, punitive damages are not available on this record where (1) the only successful claim is ex contractu under the PRSA, (2) the independent fraud claim failed, and (3) the ELRA\u2019s prerequisite of intentional nonpayment of proceeds, as such, is not satisfied. Accordingly, as a matter of Oklahoma law, the punitive\u2011damages award cannot stand and must be reversed."

      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",
      "confidence":0.76,
      "reasoning":"The standards of review and the record strongly favor affirmance on the class\u2011certification, standing, and PRSA\u2011interest issues. The district court grounded certification in a single, undisputed, class\u2011wide practice, supported by a common damages methodology built entirely from Sunoco\u2019s own data, and the identified individual issues are peripheral or damages\u2011focused. The standing challenge is inconsistent with both Article III\u2019s treatment of monetary harms and the nature of custodial unclaimed\u2011property statutes, under which the beneficial owners remain injured and can be made whole by a judgment. On PRSA interest, the statutory text (\u2018shall,\u2019 \u2018compounded annually,\u2019 \u2018until the day paid\u2019), Oklahoma\u2019s definition of compound interest, and case law treating PRSA interest as prejudgment interest together support the district court\u2019s approach, including accrual until all principal and interest are paid and continuation of accrual through judgment. By contrast, Oklahoma\u2019s characterization of PRSA suits as contractual and the narrow wording of ELRA \u00a7 903 make it unlikely that punitive damages are available here, where the class lost its tort claim and Sunoco was found liable only for failing to pay statutory interest, not for intentionally withholding proceeds themselves with the specific culpable intent ELRA requires. That issue is purely legal and turns on reconciling overlapping Oklahoma statutes, and the better reading is that punitive damages are impermissible on this record. The most plausible appellate disposition is therefore to affirm the judgment in all respects except for punitive damages, which would be vacated or reversed, producing a mixed outcome."

      "factual_background":"Debt-collection actions are among the most common lawsuits in New York, constituting about one-quarter of all suits filed in state court. In approximately seventy to ninety percent of these cases, defendants fail to appear, leading to default judgments. Many of these actions are described as \"clearly meritless,\" including cases in which the defendant does not owe the amount claimed or does not owe any money at all. Because of the high default rate, plaintiffs in such suits often never have to prove their cases, and courts may not have an opportunity to assess the validity of the claims, even when a claim would fail if subjected to adversarial testing. Default judgments can have serious consequences, such as wage garnishment, eviction, repossession of automobiles, bank account seizures, and long-term damage to a consumer's credit.\n\nIn response to these systemic issues, New York has, since at least 2015, attempted to make it easier for unrepresented defendants to respond to debt-collection suits by creating a one-page, check-the-box form answer that pro se defendants can complete and file. Upsolve contends that this form is not adequate to close the access-to-justice gap because it uses terminology and concepts that require some familiarity with the legal system, which many low-income defendants lack. For example, the form asks defendants to check boxes if service of the summons and complaint was not proper as required by law; if the statute of limitations bars the claim; if collateral was not sold at a commercially reasonable price; if the creditor failed to mitigate damages; if the creditor violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing; if the contract is unconscionable; if the equitable doctrine of laches applies; or if the defendant's income is exempt from collection.\n\nUpsolve is a nonprofit organization that seeks to address these concerns by training nonlawyer volunteers, termed \"Justice Advocates,\" to provide free, individualized legal advice to New Yorkers facing debt-collection lawsuits. Upsolve's program is designed so that Justice Advocates will:\n  (1) determine whether a person could benefit from their advice;\n  (2) confirm the limited scope of representation with the person seeking help;\n  (3) advise whether it is in that person\u2019s best interest to answer the debt-collection lawsuit;\n  (4) advise how to fill out the answer form based on the person\u2019s responses to a series of straightforward questions; and\n  (5) advise how and where to file and serve the answer.\n\nJustice Advocates are to receive virtual training and a written training guide that Upsolve states has been independently reviewed by third-party experts in consumer law and debt-collection defense. Justice Advocates must sign affidavits committing to provide advice for free; to comply with New York\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct concerning conflicts of interest, confidentiality, and informed consent; and to provide advice only within the scope of the training guide. They are warned that giving advice outside the defined scope may subject them to prosecution for unauthorized practice of law or liability under other fraud or consumer-protection laws.\n\nReverend John Udo-Okon is a pastor in the South Bronx and a prospective Justice Advocate. He has observed that many members of his community cannot understand or access their legal rights and cannot afford lawyers, including in the context of debt-collection suits. Community members frequently seek his help with legal problems, but because he is not an attorney he refers them to outside agencies. According to his declaration, individuals he refers are often placed on long waiting lists and may not receive legal help until it is too late. Rev. Udo-Okon wishes to participate in Upsolve\u2019s program as a Justice Advocate. He submitted a petition signed by 114 individuals stating that they are interested in and would benefit from receiving free legal advice from him, including regarding debt-collection issues.\n\nNew York law restricts the practice of law to those admitted to the state bar and authorizes civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized practice of law (UPL). Under New York Judiciary Law sections 476-a, 478, 484, and 485, nonlawyers who practice law can be subject to civil or criminal contempt, and the Attorney General is empowered to bring actions against persons or entities engaged in the unlawful practice of law. The New York Court of Appeals has defined the practice of law to include rendering legal advice and opinions directed to particular clients. New York courts have held that nonlawyers who, without attorney supervision, exercise independent judgment to help clients fill out legal forms are engaged in unauthorized practice. All parties in this case agree that the contemplated activities of Justice Advocates\u2014providing individualized legal advice to specific people about how to respond to their own debt-collection lawsuits and how to fill out and file the state form\u2014would fall within the scope of New York\u2019s UPL prohibitions.",

Under Holder and NIFLA, that the regulated conduct is carried out through words does not automatically convert it into a pure speech regulation.

Under Reed and City of Austin, a statute is not content based merely because it applies to a category of speech defined by its professional role or purpose.

New York\u2019s interests in regulating the practice of law and protecting consumers from unqualified legal advice are substantial and unrelated to suppressing speech, and a broad, license\u2011based UPL framework is a familiar and widely accepted means of advancing those interests. On this record, the State can plausibly show that the law does not burden substantially more speech than necessary in light of the availability of pro bono counsel, legal aid, and self\u2011help forms. Because plaintiffs would then fail to show a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits, a key prerequisite for preliminary injunctive relief against governmental action is not met.

        "appellee":"Town of Nantucket and Nantucket Town Select Board, defendants in the district court who administer and enforce the local rental-car licensing and medallion system"
      },
      "factual_background":"In 1988, the Town of Nantucket adopted a licensing-and-fee plan governing rental cars on Nantucket Island. The plan barred unlicensed rental-car operations and directed the Town to issue a license to each approved applicant, conditioned on payment of a $100 annual fee per rental motor vehicle. Later in 1988, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a special act retroactively approving this local plan and authorizing Nantucket to adopt implementing bylaws in the future.\n\nIn 1997, Nantucket amended its plan by adopting a capped medallion system for rental vehicles. The amendment set a cap of 650 rental vehicles on the island and provided that the Town \"shall issue each rental agency one Rental Vehicle Medallion (RVM) for each motor vehicle listed in its 1996 application and which received a rental sticker.\" Each RVM was defined as a non-expiring right to lease out one motor vehicle. Under this ordinance, to lawfully operate a rental-car business on Nantucket, an agency must have both (1) an agencywide license and (2) a medallion for each vehicle it rents. According to Becky's, only six companies\u2014five local firms and Hertz, a national brand\u2014submitted license applications in 1996 and therefore became entitled to medallions in 1997.\n\nSubsequently, Nantucket raised the cap on medallions to 700 but did not otherwise substantively change the medallion system. At the time of the appeal, five local companies held 382 medallions, Hertz held 310, and eight medallions had reverted to and were retained by the Town. The five local companies appear to overlap with, or be successors to, the five local operators that originally obtained medallions in 1997. The ordinance gives Nantucket discretion to reissue, retain, or retire medallions that are not currently apportioned. Nantucket has not established a process for awarding licenses to new rental agencies or for reissuing the eight medallions that it has held since 2021.\n\nIn 2023, James Broad and Rebecca McCrensky began operating Becky's Broncos, LLC as a car-rental agency on Nantucket. The company rented out two vehicles without obtaining either an agency license or medallions. Nantucket ordered Becky's to cease its rental operations at the end of the 2023 tourism season because Becky's lacked the required license and medallions. The record reflects that this enforcement was consistent with Nantucket's treatment of other operators who lacked licenses and medallions.\n\nBecky's, however, contrasts this enforcement action with Nantucket's approach to Turo, an online peer-to-peer vehicle rental platform. Nantucket has taken the position that the ordinance may not cover Turo-facilitated peer-to-peer rentals. As a result, local vehicle owners have been permitted to list vehicles on Turo without obtaining licenses or medallions, and Nantucket has not enforced the ordinance against them. In June 2024, local vehicle owners had 162 cars listed for rent on Turo, none of which were covered by rental-agency licenses or medallions.\n\nNantucket justifies the rental-car ordinance as a means of addressing concerns about parking, traffic safety, open space, and congestion on the island. It has produced evidence of those concerns and maintains that capping the number of rental vehicles and controlling entry into the rental-car market are rationally related to these goals. Nantucket has also explained its non-enforcement against Turo by pointing to legal uncertainties about whether the ordinance covers Turo and to limitations in enforcement capacity.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In May 2024, Becky's Broncos, LLC, along with Broad and McCrensky, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Town of Nantucket and the Nantucket Town Select Board, seeking monetary and injunctive relief. Becky's alleged that Nantucket's rental-car licensing and medallion ordinance: (1) violates the dormant Commerce Clause by discriminatorily insulating existing rental companies from competition and burdening interstate commerce; (2) violates federal and state antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20132, and the Massachusetts Antitrust Act, by unreasonably restraining trade and effectively allocating the local rental-car market among a small group of incumbents; (3) infringes procedural due process by denying Becky's a property interest in a rental-car license that Becky's contends the ordinance requires the Town to issue to all paying applicants; and (4) violates substantive due process because the ordinance is allegedly irrational, including in its differential treatment of Becky's and Turo.",
        "district_court_decision":"Approximately two weeks after filing the complaint, Becky's moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent Nantucket from enforcing the rental-car ordinance against Becky's. The district court held a hearing at which both sides presented arguments on the motion. On July 12, 2024, the district court issued a memorandum and order denying Becky's motion for a preliminary injunction. In doing so, the district court applied the four-factor preliminary injunction standard, focusing on Becky's likelihood of success on the merits. As part of that analysis, the court (1) rejected Becky's dormant Commerce Clause claim, finding insufficient evidence that the ordinance had a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce; (2) rejected the antitrust claims, relying on state-action immunity to conclude that the Town's conduct was exempt from federal and state antitrust liability; (3) rejected the procedural due process claim, finding that Becky's lacked a cognizable property interest in the necessary medallions; and (4) rejected the substantive due process claim under rational basis review, concluding that the ordinance bore a rational relationship to legitimate governmental objectives such as traffic, congestion, and safety.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Becky's timely appealed the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction to the First Circuit. On appeal, Becky's challenges the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding its likelihood of success on the merits of (1) the dormant Commerce Clause claim, including the court\u2019s findings regarding discriminatory effect and burdens on interstate commerce; (2) the federal and state antitrust claims under the Sherman Act and Massachusetts Antitrust Act; (3) the procedural due process claim concerning a purported property interest in a license (and, by implication, the effect of the medallion requirement); and (4) the substantive due process claim, including the rationality of the ordinance and Nantucket\u2019s different treatment of Becky's and Turo.

It maintains that this structure constitutes economic protectionism by favoring established in-island operators and constitutes a burden on interstate commerce clearly excessive in relation to any local benefits such as traffic control.

Becky's argues that it has been deprived of this property interest without adequate procedural protections. Becky's maintains that once it pays the fee and applies, the Town lacks discretion to deny a license, and the denial or non-issuance of a license thus triggers procedural due process protections.",

It thus contends that any burden falls on would-be new entrants generally, not particularly on interstate commerce, and that any incidental burden is not clearly excessive relative to the ordinance\u2019s local benefits under Pike.",

Nantucket maintains that the system is a governmental regulatory scheme, not a private cartel, and is therefore exempt. On appeal, Nantucket further argues that Becky's has failed to articulate a specific, viable theory under either Section 1 or Section 2 of the Sherman Act, having merely referenced both sections without specifying whether it is alleging an unlawful agreement in restraint of trade, monopolization, attempted monopolization, or some other theory. Nantucket asserts that this lack of specificity and evidentiary support means Becky's cannot demonstrate a likelihood of success on its antitrust claims.",

The ordinance expressly restricts mandatory medallion issuance to agencies that held licenses and listed vehicles in 1996 and gives the Town broad discretion to reissue, retain, or retire any unallocated medallions. Nantucket emphasizes that Becky's has no entitlement to medallions under the ordinance and that, without medallions, a license alone would not allow Becky's to operate.",

Nantucket further contends that its different treatment of Turo is rationally based on legal uncertainties about the ordinance\u2019s application to peer-to-peer platforms and on realistic limits to its enforcement resources. It argues that focusing enforcement on traditional rental agencies like Becky's while it evaluates how, or whether, to regulate Turo is a rational allocation of enforcement efforts.",

It argues that Becky's has not met this burden on any of its legal theories, and therefore the district court correctly denied preliminary injunctive relief. Nantucket also notes that appellate review of factual findings is deferential and that the district court's findings regarding the absence of discriminatory effect and the rational basis for the ordinance are entitled to respect unless clearly erroneous."

Even if the licensing provision\u2019s \u2018shall issue\u2019 language could be read to create a mandatory duty and thus some arguable expectancy in a license, the medallions are not governed by equivalent mandatory language. The ordinance fixes medallion rights by reference to 1996 license holders and explicitly gives the Town discretion regarding medallions that revert or remain unallocated. Becky's thus has no legitimate claim of entitlement to medallions; without them, any arguable property interest in a bare license is effectively useless for actual operation. First Circuit and Supreme Court precedent require that the asserted property interest encompass the entitlements necessary to engage in the regulated activity, and where the government retains broad discretion over a necessary precondition (here, medallions), no protected property interest exists. Given that Becky's also operated without first applying for, or being denied, either a license or medallions, the process concerns are particularly weak. On this record, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Becky's is unlikely to succeed on a procedural due process theory is fully supportable."

          "reasoning":"Under deferential rational-basis review, capping the number of rental cars and tying operation to licenses and medallions is plainly rationally related to legitimate interests in traffic, congestion, parking, and land use on a small, heavily touristed island. Courts routinely uphold similar taxi\/medallion and vehicle\u2011cap schemes. The differential treatment of traditional rental agencies and Turo\u2011facilitated peer\u2011to\u2011peer rentals can rationally be explained by legal uncertainty (whether the existing ordinance clearly covers that new business model) and limited enforcement resources; focusing on traditional operators while the Town assesses how to address Turo easily satisfies rational basis. Protection of incumbents, even if present as a side effect, does not doom the scheme if any rational public purpose can be conceived. The late\u2011raised \u201cfamilial association\u201d theory is not preserved\u2014raised only in reply and not developed below\u2014and in any event does not convert this economic regulation into one implicating a fundamental right.

As to the key legal issues, the First Circuit is likely to agree that Becky's has shown at most serious questions, not a probability of success, and none of the district court\u2019s factual determinations (e.g., about the ordinance\u2019s operation, the Town\u2019s traffic and congestion interests, uniform enforcement against unlicensed traditional agencies) appears clearly erroneous. Without a strong showing on the merits, denial of preliminary relief lies well within the range of reasonable outcomes.

      "reasoning":"All of Becky's theories confront demanding standards at the preliminary injunction stage. The ordinance is facially neutral and fits comfortably within traditional police\u2011power regulation of rental vehicles; the record does not show the kind of targeted discrimination against interstate commerce that would trigger strict scrutiny, nor the clearly excessive burden on interstate commerce required by Pike. The antitrust claims run headlong into state\u2011action immunity and are poorly specified as to theory. For procedural due process, the absence of any entitlement to the essential medallions defeats the claimed property interest. For substantive due process, rational\u2011basis review is extremely deferential and is easily satisfied by the Town\u2019s articulated interests and by plausible explanations for its current approach to Turo. Given these weaknesses on likelihood of success and the deference owed to the district court\u2019s weighing of the preliminary\u2011injunction factors, the appellate court is very likely to affirm the denial of preliminary injunctive relief on all issues."

      },
      "factual_background":"The plaintiffs are nine closed-end mutual funds that primarily invest in securities of Puerto Rico issuers and distribute monthly dividends to shareholders. Most investors are Puerto Rico residents who pay Puerto Rico income tax, not U.S. federal income tax, on Puerto Rico-source income. Each fund holds an annual meeting where shareholders elect directors to govern that fund.\n\nIn May 2021, a group of shareholders of Puerto Rico Residents Tax-Free Fund IV, Inc. (PRRTFF IV) sent identical letters to that fund. The letters proposed adding an investment objective \"to return to shareholders the net assets of [PRRTFF IV] by or before January 31, 2022.\" Each letter stated it was from \"the Stockholder Group\" but bore a different signatory. One signatory was defendant William Hawk, an executive officer of Ocean Capital LLC and a principal owner of PRCE Management LLC, an investment management firm focusing on Puerto Rico closed-end funds and managing Ocean Capital. The Funds allege that many signatories to the Stockholder Group letters used non-party First Southern, a financial services company affiliated with PRCE, as a stockbroker. The letters were delivered to PRRTFF IV via Hawk and First Southern. First Southern was managed by Hawk and his associates Vasileios A. Sfyris and Benjamin T. Eiler. No similar letters were sent to any fund other than PRRTFF IV.\n\nIn summer 2021, after Funds IV and V set their annual meetings, Ocean Capital and Hawk (together with others referred to in the pleadings as the Nominating Parties) put forth their own director nominees for Funds IV and V and launched proxy campaigns. A shareholder letter announced formation of the \"Coalition of Concerned UBS Closed-End Bond Fund Investors\" (CCI), which sought to elect \"highly qualified and independent\" directors to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value, including possible liquidation of Funds IV and V. The letter did not identify CCI members other than Ocean Capital and Hawk.\n\nThe Nominating Parties also launched a public website about CCI and the nominees. On the \"Our Coalition\" section, they stated that Ocean Capital formed CCI as a coalition \"comprised of shareholders\" to advocate for improved leadership at Funds IV and V by nominating aligned and experienced director candidates. The same materials were attached to a Schedule 14A proxy filing. In a July 2021 proxy statement, the Nominating Parties stated there were no arrangements or understandings between Ocean Capital or its affiliates and the nominees other than their consent to be named and to serve if elected.\n\nIn August 2021, the Nominating Parties sent a second letter to shareholders of Funds IV and V, asserting that Ocean Capital's interests were \"squarely aligned with shareholders,\" that it was not seeking short-term profits at the expense of other investors, and that Ocean Capital was not a company qualifying for Puerto Rico Act 20\/22 tax benefits (\"20\/22 Act Company\") and did not enjoy tax benefits under those statutes.\n\nBetween September 2021 and April 2022, the Nominating Parties and Ethan Danial extended proxy contests to the remaining seven funds, launching campaigns to elect new directors and filing proxy statements that contained similar or identical descriptions of CCI, its purpose, and the nominees.\n\nSeparately, under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and SEC rules, any person or group that acquires more than five percent of a voting class of a public company's securities must file a Schedule 13D disclosing, among other things, the identity and holdings of all group members, any contracts or understandings among them, and any intent to acquire control or effect major changes.\n\nBetween October 2021 and April 2022, various Defendants-Appellees filed Schedule 13Ds covering seven of the nine funds (Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, PRRTFF I, PRRTFF IV, PRRTFF VI, and TFF I). Different combinations of Ocean Capital, Hawk, Rosenthal, Izquierdo, Cruz-Rivera, and Danial filed these 13Ds, disclosing the number of shares owned by Ocean Capital, Hawk, and the relevant director nominees. Each initial Schedule 13D included a Joint Filing and Solicitation Agreement in which the signatories agreed to form a \"Group\" for the purpose of soliciting proxies or consents for proposals and the election of their nominees to the boards. The 13Ds did not disclose any information regarding the earlier \"Stockholder Group\" that had written to PRRTFF IV.\n\nDefendants later filed amended Schedule 13Ds for PRRTFF I, PRRTFF VI, and TFF I, adding additional individuals (including Cruz-Rivera and Khaghan) as joint filers for some funds. It was unclear in the record whether the five percent ownership threshold for Section 13(d) filing had been met for Funds IV and V.\n\nIn March 2022, before any of the Funds held elections, the Nominating Parties voluntarily filed with the SEC a series of Schedule 14A definitive additional materials (Supplemental Disclosures) for eight funds. These materials disclosed the existence of the lawsuit, informed shareholders about the Funds' allegations of securities law violations, and stated that the information in the Supplemental Disclosures superseded or supplemented prior filings. The Nominating Parties attached copies of the complaint and amended complaint and expressed their view that the complaint lacked merit.\n\nIn the Supplemental Disclosures, the Nominating Parties denied the existence of any undisclosed Section 13(d) \"group,\" stating that none of Ocean Capital, its nominees, or Hawk had agreed to act as a group with any fund shareholders. They explained that CCI was not intended to describe a discernible group of investors but instead a like-mindedness among various shareholders, and asserted that Ocean Capital, Hawk, and its nominees had never entered into, and had no intent to enter into, any agreement with others to act together for acquiring, holding, voting, or disposing of the Funds' securities. The Supplemental Disclosures also clarified that their nominees, if elected, would consider \"all avenues to maximize value,\" including liquidation, and that while Ocean Capital itself was not a 20\/22 Act Company, certain principals of Ocean Capital, including Hawk, were entitled to Act 20\/22 tax benefits. The filings further elaborated on issues including compensation of incumbent directors, the experience of nominee Jos\u00e9 R. Izquierdo, performance of certain funds, public statements by a former UBS Group officer, and the outcome of an SEC enforcement action against UBS Financial Services Inc. of Puerto Rico.\n\nSubsequently, CCI's nominees were elected by wide margins to the boards of PRRTFF I, PRRTFF VI, and TFF I at their respective shareholder meetings in 2022 and 2023.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"The Funds filed their original complaint on February 28, 2022, and an amended complaint on January 5, 2023, asserting three federal securities counts against varying sets of defendants.\n\nCount I (Section 13(d) \/ Rule 13d-1): Brought against the \"Nominating Parties\" (defined as Ocean Capital, Hawk, Izquierdo, Rosenthal, and Cruz-Rivera), Ethan Danial, and the alleged \"Stockholder Group\" (defined to include Ocean Capital, RAD Investments, Sanzam Investments, Zeines, Soto Alvarado, Honne II, Gonzalez, Montalvo, Calderon, Acosta Rivera, Hurwitz, Nevarez Torres, Perez-Gutierrez, and the Estate of Jose Hidalgo). The Funds alleged that defendants filed incomplete Schedule 13Ds for disclosed group members and failed to file 13Ds for undisclosed group members. They claimed the 13Ds failed to identify all shareholding members of CCI beyond Ocean Capital and Hawk and that no 13Ds were filed for shareholding members of the Stockholder Group who allegedly were acting with Hawk and Ocean Capital regarding the Funds, in violation of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 13d-1.\n\nCount II (Section 14(a) \/ Rule 14a-9): Brought against the Nominating Parties and Danial. The Funds alleged that defendants' proxy materials contained false and misleading statements and omissions in violation of Section 14(a) and SEC Rule 14a-9, including misstatements or omissions regarding the identities and roles of Stockholder Group and CCI members, the characterization of CCI as a \"coalition\" implying broad shareholder support, the defendants' true intent to liquidate the funds, their status concerning Puerto Rico Act 20\/22 tax benefits, the experience of their board nominees, the performance of the funds, compensation of certain incumbent directors, the outcome of an SEC proceeding against UBS Puerto Rico, and the result of the shareholder vote at PRRTFF I.\n\nCount III (Section 20(a) control-person liability): Brought against \"the Controlling Persons\" (Hawk, Sfyris, Eiler, and PRCE). The Funds alleged these defendants were controlling persons of Ocean Capital and had intimate knowledge of the incomplete and misleading statements alleged in Counts I and II, but failed to prevent or correct them, thereby incurring joint liability under Section 20(a).\n\nThe Funds sought relief including an order directing defendants to publicly correct the alleged misstatements and omissions, to file complete and accurate Section 13(d) and 14(a) disclosures with the SEC, and a permanent injunction barring defendants from soliciting proxies regarding the Funds until such disclosures were made.",
        "district_court_decision":"The case was referred to U.S. Magistrate Judge Giselle L\u00f3pez-Soler. On August 10, 2023, she issued a report and recommendation under Rule 72(b) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) recommending dismissal of the Funds' complaint on two independent grounds: failure to state a claim and mootness.\n\nOn the Section 13(d) claims, she recommended dismissal for failure to state a claim as to Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, PRRTFF I, PRRTFF VI, and TFF I, concluding that there were no factual allegations affirmatively linking the Stockholder Group letter to those funds. Assuming for discussion the existence of a Section 13(d) group as to PRRTFF IV, she further concluded that any deficiencies were cured and the claims were independently moot because defendants' Supplemental Disclosures, which attached the complaint and amended complaint, made clear the Funds' position about the existence and goals of an alleged group.\n\nOn the Section 14(a) claims, she recommended dismissal as well. As to the alleged failure to disclose group members, she noted that the issue was disputed and that any defect was cured by informing shareholders of the lawsuit and attaching the complaint. She found that use of the term \"coalition\" did not necessarily imply broad shareholder support, especially given the vague and noncommittal description of CCI on the website and in proxy statements. She found no factual support for the proposition that liquidation was the only alternative to be considered by the new directors if elected and concluded that the remaining challenged statements were not false or misleading.\n\nOn the Section 20(a) claim, she recommended dismissal on the ground that Section 20(a) liability requires an underlying securities violation, which she concluded was not adequately pleaded.\n\nThe Funds filed objections to the report and recommendation, and Defendants-Appellees responded. After independent review, U.S. District Judge Gina R. M\u00e9ndez-Mir\u00f3 adopted the report and recommendation in full, dismissed the Funds' claims, and retained jurisdiction over Defendants-Appellees' counterclaims. The Funds then moved for a stay of proceedings on the counterclaims under Rule 54(b. Judge M\u00e9ndez-Mir\u00f3 denied the motion to stay and granted defendants' requested relief on their counterclaims by issuing an injunction ordering the Funds to seat CCI's victorious nominees on the boards of PRRTFF I, PRRTFF VI, and TFF I.",

          "reasoning":"The Section 13(d) claim was dismissed on Rule 12(b)(6) grounds, so review is de novo. As to all funds other than PRRTFF IV, the amended complaint ties the alleged undisclosed group only to the PRRTFF IV \u2018Stockholder Group\u2019 letters; there are no particularized factual allegations that those signatories, or any other undisclosed persons, agreed to act together with respect to the other funds. Shared use of a broker (First Southern), business relationships, and a generalized \u2018coalition\u2019 label are, under prevailing \u00a7 13(d) jurisprudence, insufficient to plausibly plead a statutory \u2018group\u2019 formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of the securities of each fund. As to PRRTFF IV, even assuming a group existed, the only relief sought is injunctive, which requires irreparable harm and a live violation. Before any elections, defendants voluntarily filed extensive Supplemental Disclosures that (1) disclosed the existence of this lawsuit, (2) attached the complaint and amended complaint in full (thus presenting the Funds\u2019 own allegations about the supposed group and its purposes), and (3) expressly stated that these materials superseded or supplemented all earlier proxy and Schedule 14A materials. Courts have repeatedly held that when supplemental proxy\/\u00a7 13(d) disclosures fully apprise shareholders of the alleged deficiencies and of the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, any risk of ongoing deception is eliminated and claims for injunctive relief are moot or equitable relief is unwarranted for lack of irreparable harm. Here, defendants continued to deny liability, but the shareholders had both sides\u2019 positions before voting. That is enough to defeat a forward\u2011looking injunction, even if there had been a technical disclosure violation earlier. On this record the district court\u2019s conclusions\u2014no plausible undisclosed group for most funds and, as to PRRTFF IV, no basis for equitable relief and mootness\u2014are well within mainstream de novo analysis and are likely to be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"The Section 14(a)\/Rule 14a\u20119 dismissal is also reviewed de novo under Rule 12(b)(6) and PSLRA pleading standards. Most of the challenged statements are classic examples of non\u2011actionable puffery or opinion: describing CCI as a \u2018coalition\u2019 of concerned investors and stating Ocean Capital\u2019s interests were \u2018squarely aligned\u2019 with shareholders are generalized, aspirational characterizations that do not convey concrete, verifiable facts about ownership structure or voting agreements. Courts routinely hold that such broad alignment language is immaterial as a matter of law. The record also reflects that defendants never stated liquidation was the only goal; contemporaneous materials describe liquidation as one of several possible strategies to \u201cmaximize value,\u201d which undercuts any inference of falsity. The tax\u2011benefit allegation similarly falls short: the initial statement that Ocean Capital itself was not a 20\/22 Act company was literally true; the later clarification that some principals, including Hawk, did receive 20\/22 benefits eliminates any plausible claim of a continuing material omission. Under the PSLRA, the Funds must plead with particularity why these statements were false or misleading and why any omission rendered other statements materially misleading. The complaint relies largely on inferential leaps (e.g., that \u2018coalition\u2019 implies broad numerical support and a \u2018bandwagon effect\u2019) not grounded in specific factual allegations about actual shareholder perceptions or numbers. Finally, any potential ambiguity was substantially cured before the challenged votes by the Supplemental Disclosures, which (a) highlighted the lawsuit and the Funds\u2019 detailed allegations of misrepresentation, and (b) expressly supplemented or superseded prior proxy materials on the very topics at issue. Once shareholders are told exactly what the Funds contend was hidden or misstated, it is difficult to show a substantial likelihood that any residual misimpression would remain material. Given these defects in falsity and materiality\u2014and the curing effect of the supplemental proxy materials\u2014the district court\u2019s dismissal of the \u00a7 14(a) claims is likely to be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"The denial of a Rule 54(b) stay and the grant of injunctive relief on defendants\u2019 counterclaims are reviewed for abuse of discretion, with underlying legal conclusions reviewed de novo and factual findings for clear error. Once the court dismissed the Funds\u2019 affirmative securities claims, the only remaining merits issues concerned enforcement of shareholder election results at PRRTFF I, PRRTFF VI, and TFF I. It is undisputed that CCI\u2019s nominees won those elections by wide margins. Corporations generally must honor valid shareholder votes absent a substantive legal defect in the solicitation. Given the dismissal of all disclosure\u2011based challenges, the district court reasonably concluded that defendants had shown a likelihood of success on their counterclaims and that the balance of equities and public interest favored prompt seating of directors chosen by shareholders. The Funds\u2019 argument that their own dismissed claims should block implementation of the vote is effectively mooted by affirmance of the dismissals. As to the refusal to stay under Rule 54(b), the court acted within its broad case\u2011management discretion: the counterclaims were closely intertwined with the merits already adjudicated, and there was no compelling justification to delay enforcement of duly held elections. There is no indication the injunction or denial of a stay rested on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding; the relief is narrowly tailored to implement the election results. Under an abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion standard, this decision is highly likely to be affirmed."

The amended complaint\u2019s \u00a7 13(d) group allegations rest largely on circumstantial overlap in relationships, use of a common broker, and the rhetorical label \u2018coalition\u2019; that constellation of facts is, under established case law, insufficient to plausibly allege a statutory \u2018group\u2019 formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of securities across all nine funds, particularly where no similar letters or coordinated actions are alleged for most funds. For \u00a7 14(a), the challenged statements are either non\u2011actionable puffery, opinions about alignment or strategy, or were clarified before any vote, undermining falsity and materiality. Without a viable primary violation, the derivative \u00a7 20(a) claim necessarily fails. Finally, the injunction on defendants\u2019 counterclaims simply enforces shareholder election results after the Funds\u2019 attacks on the solicitation were rejected. Under deferential abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion review, and given the strong policy favoring implementation of shareholder votes where no live disclosure violations remain, that injunctive order and the denial of a stay are unlikely to be disturbed. Taken together, these considerations support an across\u2011the\u2011board affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment."

      "factual_background":"The plaintiffs are nine current or former inmates at the MacDougall\u2011Walker Correctional Institution in Connecticut who, between 2009 and 2016, were detained in a special housing unit at the prison known as \"Q\u2011Pod.\" Q\u2011Pod is a separate building from the prison's main facility and contains 60 cells, each with two bunks. Department of Correction (DOC) regulations classify Q\u2011Pod as a \"reclassification unit\" used to house inmates transitioning from more restrictive confinement, such as punitive segregation in the Restrictive Housing Unit (RHU), back to the general population. The prison's Inmate Handbook states that when an inmate is found guilty of violating the Code of Penal Discipline and serves time in the RHU, upon release from RHU, the inmate will complete the remainder of his punishment on \"Unassigned Status\" in Q\u2011Pod. The Handbook provides that inmates will remain in Q\u2011Pod for 90 days for more serious (Class A) disciplinary infractions and 60 days for less serious (Class B) infractions. The plaintiffs allege that, despite these guidelines, they were often confined in Q\u2011Pod for significantly longer periods, including allegations of confinement for five months or more, with one plaintiff asserting nine consecutive months in Q\u2011Pod, others alleging seven months consecutively and more than a year in total, nearly five consecutive months and over a year in total, and over three months on a Class A ticket.\n\nThe plaintiffs characterize Q\u2011Pod not as a transitional or reclassification unit but as a punitive unit with harsher conditions than the prison's general\u2011population wings. They complain of five main aspects of their conditions of confinement in Q\u2011Pod:\n\n1. **Isolation and out\u2011of\u2011cell time**: Plaintiffs state that they were confined to their cells for 22 hours per day, with only two hours per day for recreation, usually in an outdoor yard with a basketball court. General\u2011population inmates, by contrast, had three hours of recreation per day. Although Q\u2011Pod cells are generally double\u2011bunked, plaintiffs allege that some inmates were housed alone, resulting in substantial social isolation despite Q\u2011Pod not being formally designated as solitary confinement.\n\n2. **Sanitation and toilet restrictions**: Plaintiffs allege that Q\u2011Pod cells were unsanitary due in part to restrictions on toilet flushing. According to plaintiffs, attempts to flush the toilet more than a specified number of times in a short period would cause the toilet to stop functioning for two to three hours at a time. The written guidance to inmates indicates that a toilet can be flushed two times in five minutes, after which the inmate must wait five minutes before flushing again, and that a third flush attempted within ten minutes will lock the toilet for 30 minutes. Defendants contend that similar flush timers exist in other MacDougall\u2011Walker housing units to comply with a municipal water\u2011use agreement. Plaintiffs dispute that other units are subject to such timers and further assert that Q\u2011Pod officers sometimes shut off the water in Q\u2011Pod for hours at a time.\n\n3. **Medical care and counseling**: Plaintiffs allege that, despite the presence of a medical room in Q\u2011Pod, they were denied medical treatment. They also contend that there was no drug and alcohol counseling available in Q\u2011Pod. However, they do not identify specific incidents of being denied medical care for particular conditions or injuries.\n\n4. **Programs, work, and education**: Plaintiffs assert that Q\u2011Pod inmates were denied vocational training, job assignments, and educational opportunities. The parties agree that such opportunities are considered privileges that may be restricted as part of the disciplinary process. Plaintiffs do not challenge the disciplinary proceedings that led to their initial placement in the RHU but argue that restricting these privileges while they were in Q\u2011Pod amounted to an arbitrary and capricious additional sanction inconsistent with Q\u2011Pod's stated role as a reclassification unit.\n\n5. **Religious services**: Seven of the plaintiffs (Goode, Pellot\u2011Castellano, Rice, Davis, Rivera, Gladding, and Ortiz) broadly allege that Q\u2011Pod had \"segregated & restricted religious services (if any at all).\" They do not specify particular religious beliefs, requests to participate in specific religious services, or particular denials of such requests. Two plaintiffs\u2014Baltas and Tarasco\u2014make more detailed allegations related to Native American religious practices. Both state that they requested but were denied access to \"smudging,\" a Native American ceremony involving the burning of grasses and tobacco, ordinarily led by an elder or spiritual leader and treated as a congregate activity for general\u2011population Native American inmates. In response to a grievance filed by Baltas, a prison official documented that inmates in Q\u2011Pod do not smudge with the general population but are allowed to perform \"dry smudging\" in their cells until they are moved to another unit, and that the Native American chaplain holds a separate service with inmates in Q\u2011Pod. Tarasco alleges that he was barred from participating in both smudging and Native American sweat\u2011lodge services. Sweat\u2011lodge ceremonies at MacDougall\u2011Walker are described as congregate Native American religious practices occurring on a monthly basis for general\u2011population inmates and taking place in a special domed lodge constructed for that purpose. Tarasco\u2019s former cellmate reports that Tarasco raised his desire to attend sweat\u2011lodge and smudging services with both a Native American services elder and a Q\u2011Pod counselor. According to this attestation, the counselor told Tarasco that the wardens were aware of his request but that staffing issues might prevent providing those services to Q\u2011Pod inmates.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On February 15, 2017, the plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and under Connecticut state law. They sought damages and injunctive relief. As relevant to the appeal, the plaintiffs alleged that: (1) the conditions of their confinement in Q\u2011Pod\u2014particularly the degree of isolation and the sanitary conditions\u2014violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment; (2) their confinement in Q\u2011Pod without specified procedural safeguards and for periods allegedly exceeding those permitted by DOC rules violated their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights; (3) restrictions on access to religious services in Q\u2011Pod, including denial of access to Native American congregate services such as smudging and the sweat lodge, violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion; and (4) their treatment violated certain protections under the Connecticut Constitution and state law. Defendants denied plaintiffs' factual allegations and asserted qualified immunity as a defense to the federal claims.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court (Judge Robert N. Chatigny) granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on all federal claims on the ground of qualified immunity, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state\u2011law claims, and denied the requests for injunctive relief as moot. Regarding the Eighth Amendment claims, the court concluded that the conditions in Q\u2011Pod\u2014including the level of isolation and the toilet\u2011flush restrictions\u2014did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation and that, in any event, plaintiffs had not identified controlling authority clearly establishing that the Q\u2011Pod conditions violated the Eighth Amendment. As to the Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claims, the district court found the record insufficient to determine definitively whether prisoners had a state\u2011created liberty interest in avoiding Q\u2011Pod confinement. The court further concluded that even assuming such a liberty interest, conditions in Q\u2011Pod were not dramatically different from those in the general population, and that plaintiffs had not pointed to clearly established law demonstrating that confining them in Q\u2011Pod without additional procedural safeguards for the durations alleged violated due process. On the First Amendment free exercise claims, the district court determined that only Baltas and Tarasco had raised potentially triable issues that they were deprived of a constitutional right to participate in congregate religious services but held that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiffs had not cited case law clearly establishing inmates' rights to participate in sweat\u2011lodge or smudging services specifically. The court therefore entered judgment in favor of defendants on all federal claims, declined supplemental jurisdiction over the state\u2011law claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3), and denied injunctive relief as moot. After this ruling, plaintiffs moved for reconsideration. The case was reassigned to Chief Judge Michael P. Shea, who denied the motion for reconsideration on June 5, 2023.",

On appeal, they challenge the rulings that: (1) defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from the Eighth Amendment claims concerning isolation and sanitary conditions in Q\u2011Pod; (2) defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claims challenging their placement and continued confinement in Q\u2011Pod; and (3) defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on the First Amendment free exercise claims, including the more specific claims by Baltas and Tarasco regarding denial of access to Native American congregate religious practices such as smudging and, for Tarasco, use of the sweat lodge.

They also argue that toilet\u2011flush restrictions and alleged instances of shut\u2011off water exposed them to unsanitary conditions, which, in light of existing precedent condemning confinement with human waste or without adequate sanitation, were known to be unconstitutional.

They further argue that their Q\u2011Pod terms exceeded the durations specified in the Handbook and that Q\u2011Pod was being used as an \"illegal and off\u2011the\u2011books\" form of administrative segregation, without the procedural safeguards that would accompany formal disciplinary sanctions.

They emphasize that there is a long\u2011recognized, clearly established right of prisoners to participate in congregate religious services and that, at MacDougall\u2011Walker, Native American inmates in the general population were allowed to attend congregate sweat\u2011lodge and smudging ceremonies. They maintain that they have adequately alleged sincerely held Native American religious beliefs and that Baltas and Tarasco specifically requested access to these congregate services but were denied. Plaintiffs argue that defendants offered no legitimate penological justification for these denials and that, under established case law protecting congregate worship, reasonable officials would have known that blanket denial of access to existing congregate Native American services, without justification, violated the First Amendment.

They argue that there is no clearly established constitutional right for inmates to participate in specific forms of Native American ceremonies such as sweat\u2011lodge or smudging, particularly in a specialized housing unit, and that the focus on these specific practices goes beyond the scope of prior case law. Defendants assert that, because neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit had clearly defined the contours of a right to sweat\u2011lodge or smudging services for segregated inmates during the relevant time period, they are entitled to qualified immunity.

Durations of a few to several months in such conditions, without more extreme restrictions, fall in or near the range that the Second Circuit has often deemed not clearly atypical and significant as a matter of clearly established law. The district court expressly found the record insufficient even to determine definitively that a state\u2011created liberty interest existed, and reasonably concluded that no precedent clearly established that Q\u2011Pod\u2019s conditions and durations required additional process beyond what attached to the underlying RHU discipline (which plaintiffs do not challenge).

          "reasoning":"The legal question whether the right was clearly established is reviewed de novo, and at the summary\u2011judgment stage plaintiffs get the benefit of factual inferences. The district court focused narrowly on the absence of precedent specifically about \u2018smudging\u2019 or sweat\u2011lodge ceremonies. But Second Circuit and other circuits\u2019 precedent long before these events recognized that inmates possess a clearly established right to attend congregate religious services, subject to legitimate penological limitations, and that officials may not arbitrarily deny access to such services when they are provided to the general population. Here, Baltas and Tarasco allege sincerely held Native American beliefs, that congregate smudging and sweat\u2011lodge observances were available to general\u2011population Native American inmates, that they specifically requested access while in Q\u2011Pod, and that those requests were denied. The record also contains evidence that only \u2018dry smudging\u2019 alone in a cell was allowed, and that a Q\u2011Pod counselor cited general \u2018staffing issues\u2019 but no specific, developed security rationale. On this record, there are factual disputes regarding (1) whether defendants actually denied access, (2) what alternative services were available in Q\u2011Pod, and (3) whether any asserted security or staffing justification was genuine and reasonably related to penological interests, all of which preclude summary judgment. And as to clearly established law, it was not necessary that prior cases address sweat lodges or smudging by name; the right is defined at the level of congregate worship and meaningful exercise of religion, not particular liturgical forms. A reasonable official would have understood that categorically excluding Q\u2011Pod Native American inmates from existing congregate Native services, without individualized security reasons or adequate alternatives, would violate that clearly established right. The appellate court is therefore likely to reverse the grant of qualified immunity at least as to Baltas\u2019s and Tarasco\u2019s First Amendment claims and remand those claims for further proceedings, while affirming dismissal of the more generalized, nonspecific religious\u2011access allegations of the other seven plaintiffs."

The appropriate course is to vacate the dismissal of the state\u2011law claims and remand. On remand, the district court can reassess supplemental jurisdiction in light of the revived federal claims, applying the usual factors of judicial economy, fairness, convenience, and comity.

Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Baltas and Tarasco, there are fact disputes about what was denied and why, and those disputes matter both to the existence of a constitutional violation and to whether any restrictions were reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. That combination of clearly established general law and unresolved factual questions makes reversal on the First Amendment claims for those two plaintiffs probable. Because some federal claims would then be reinstated, the basis for declining supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367(c)(3) evaporates, and the state\u2011law claims must be returned to the district court for renewed consideration. The overall result is thus a mixed disposition: affirmance on conditions\u2011of\u2011confinement and due process, but reversal and remand on the targeted free\u2011exercise claims and on supplemental jurisdiction."

      "factual_background":"Jamel Upson was incarcerated in the custody of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) at Upstate Correctional Facility. In 2012 and 2013, while in DOCCS custody, he had been hospitalized three times for bowel obstruction issues. On April 30, 2015, Upson began experiencing symptoms including vomiting, abdominal pain and cramping, profuse sweating, and dizziness. He alerted a correction officer that he had a medical emergency and requested assistance. Geraldine Wilson, a nurse at Upstate, responded to his cell. According to Upson, he told Wilson that he had been vomiting, that he had a history of bowel obstructions that could be confirmed in his medical records, and requested that she check those records. He asserts that on this first encounter she left without taking further steps. Later that day, Wilson examined him in her office. Upson states that when he arrived, she made light of the situation, laughed at him, and told him there was nothing wrong with him. He avers that he was 'hunched over in agony' on his bed when she first came to his cell, that he informed her of his 'extreme pain,' 'constant vomiting,' and history of bowel obstructions, showed her his vomit, and that the officer who transported him for examination did not shackle him because of his distress. He further avers that during the examination Wilson observed him having obvious signs of pain when getting onto the examination table and when she touched his stomach, yet she used crude language indicating she believed he was faking, said she did not want to hear what he had to say, refused to review his medical records, and sent him back to his cell without treatment. Wilson disputes this description, asserting that when she arrived at his cell, Upson was laughing and joking, became argumentative, refused to turn on his cell light, and was able to stand without signs of distress, and that during the examination he was smiling, laughing, and joking, and she observed nothing indicating a medical emergency. Upson\u2019s condition allegedly worsened overnight. On the morning of May 1, 2015, Elizabeth White, another nurse at Upstate, was making her daily medical rounds. From inside his cell, Upson attempted to report his emergency to White. According to Upson, White told him to submit a sick call request and continued her rounds; he does not claim to have interacted with her again. Later, after White\u2019s shift ended, Upson requested an emergency sick call. Other medical staff evaluated him and determined that he needed hospitalization. He was transported to a hospital, where he remained for five days and was treated for a bowel obstruction.",

There is no detailed evidence that he relayed to her the same level of specific information he claims to have given Wilson (e.g., prior bowel obstructions, constant vomiting, extreme observable distress) or that White observed obvious, emergent symptoms indicating a substantial and immediate risk. Instructing an inmate during rounds to use the standard sick call process, without more concrete evidence that the nurse was aware of an acute emergency and consciously chose to ignore it, is generally treated as, at most, negligence or a disagreement about the proper way to triage, not deliberate indifference. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Upson, a reasonable jury would not be compelled to find that White actually drew the inference of a substantial risk and then disregarded it. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to White was therefore within the legal standard."

As to Wilson, Upson\u2019s sworn account, if believed, describes explicit notice to a medical professional of severe, ongoing symptoms, a known history of bowel obstructions, and an allegedly dismissive refusal to investigate or treat. Appellate courts regularly hold that such evidence suffices to raise a jury question on the subjective deliberate-indifference element, making summary judgment inappropriate. In contrast, the record regarding White is sparse: it establishes only a brief interaction during rounds where she instructed Upson to submit a sick call request and saw him no further. Absent specific evidence that she was told or directly observed facts making an acute emergency obvious, most courts conclude that this conduct does not rise to deliberate indifference. Accordingly, the more likely result is reversal as to Wilson and affirmance as to White, yielding a mixed disposition overall."

        "appellant":"Derek Kramer, plaintiff in the district court asserting ERISA claims for denial of benefits and interference",
        "appellee":"American Electric Power Executive Severance Plan and American Electric Power Service Corporation, defendants in the district court"
      },
      "factual_background":"In 2018, Derek Kramer joined American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP) as vice president and chief digital officer of AEP Charge, described as the company's new \"innovation hub.\" Nearly a year after he was hired, AEP offered Kramer the option to participate in the American Electric Power Executive Severance Plan (the Plan), which he accepted. Under the Plan, eligible employees could receive severance based on base salary and performance if their employment ended due to an \"Involuntary Termination\" or a \"Good Reason Resignation.\"\n\nIn 2020, AEP terminated Kramer's employment. Two events led to that decision.\n\nFirst, during an annual audit, AEP's audit services department discovered that Kramer's executive assistant had charged personal expenses to her company credit card in violation of corporate policy. Audit representatives contacted Kramer about these charges. Kramer states that he followed up the same day, spoke with his assistant, and warned her about charging personal expenses to the card. In the following year's audit, the department again flagged the assistant. She then had the third-highest charges among company credit-card users, including excessive business expenditures and prohibited personal charges. Kramer had approved these charges. AEP suspended Kramer while it investigated the credit-card issues.\n\nSecond, as part of the investigation, AEP sought to retrieve Kramer's company-issued cell phone, which he also used as a personal device. AEP's regional security coordinator, Kerrie Campbell, went to Kramer's home to collect the phone in accordance with company policy. Kramer hesitated to turn over the phone, initially asked to make a call, and went inside while Campbell waited outside. When he returned, Campbell requested the phone and its PIN. Kramer again hesitated, expressing concern that AEP would be able to see what was on the phone. After Campbell explained that the investigation might require reviewing the phone, Kramer provided a PIN, which Campbell repeated aloud to confirm. When she attempted to use the PIN at her vehicle, she found it was incomplete. She returned to the house, obtained the PIN again, and this time confirmed that the phone unlocked. Following company procedure, she put the phone in airplane mode before leaving.\n\nCampbell then delivered the phone to AEP's security manager, Michael Knorps, who connected it to forensic software to extract data. During the extraction, Knorps observed the phone spontaneously reboot and begin wiping itself. Based on his information-technology and law-enforcement experience, and the fact that he had not previously seen this occur at AEP, he suspected that Kramer had remotely wiped the phone. AEP contacted Kramer for an explanation. Kramer stated that he had removed his personal Apple ID and iCloud account from the phone, but he said he did not intend to wipe the device. After further research, testing, and consultation, Knorps confirmed his suspicion that Kramer had intentionally wiped the phone.\n\nOn October 2, 2020, AEP terminated Kramer's employment. His direct supervisor told him that the termination was based on his failure to tighten oversight of his assistant\u2019s expenses. In November 2020, Kramer submitted a formal claim for severance benefits under the Plan.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, AEP\u2019s chief human resources officer, Julius Cox, sent Kramer a letter denying his claim for benefits. Cox determined that Kramer's employment had been terminated \"for Cause\" under the Plan, which rendered him ineligible to receive Plan benefits. Cox cited two bases for a \"Cause\" determination. First, he concluded that Kramer's handling of his assistant\u2019s expense-account charges violated company policies on proper expense-account behavior, falling within Plan \u00a7 2.5(v), which defines \"Cause\" to include a material violation of company rules of conduct after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure. Second, he concluded that Kramer\u2019s wiping of his company cell phone while it was under investigation constituted \"Cause\" under Plan \u00a7 2.5(ii), which defines \"Cause\" to include willful misconduct, fraud, embezzlement, or dishonesty in connection with an employee\u2019s duties.\n\nKramer pursued an internal appeal of Cox\u2019s denial to the Plan\u2019s appeal committee. The committee reviewed the administrative record, agreed with Cox\u2019s conclusions, and denied Kramer\u2019s appeal. In its decision letter, the committee identified specific evidence in the administrative record that supported each of Cox\u2019s determinative findings relating to both expense-account violations and the phone-wiping incident.",

He asserted a denial-of-benefits claim under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), seeking to recover severance benefits he contended were due under the Plan. He also asserted a claim for interference under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140. Kramer included a demand for a jury trial on his claims.",
        "district_court_decision":"AEP and the Plan moved to strike Kramer's jury demand. The district court granted the motion, striking the request for a jury trial on his ERISA denial-of-benefits claim. Kramer then moved to conduct discovery beyond the administrative record compiled by Cox and the appeal committee. Acknowledging existing Sixth Circuit precedent limiting discovery in ERISA denial-of-benefits actions primarily to procedural issues, Kramer argued that Supreme Court precedent had implicitly abrogated those limits and that, in any event, he should be allowed broader discovery related to his procedural allegations. The magistrate judge permitted discovery into alleged bias, conflict of interest, or prejudice in the administrative process but otherwise denied discovery beyond the administrative record. Kramer did not file objections to that discovery order.\n\nDuring discovery, AEP and the Plan withheld nearly 300 documents as protected by the attorney-client privilege. Kramer moved to compel production, arguing that ERISA's fiduciary framework triggered the \"fiduciary exception\" to the attorney-client privilege and required disclosure of those communications. AEP and the Plan opposed, asserting that the Plan was a \"top hat\" plan exempt from ERISA\u2019s fiduciary requirements and therefore not subject to the fiduciary exception. The magistrate judge agreed with AEP and the Plan that the Plan qualified as a top-hat plan and denied Kramer's motion to compel. The district court overruled Kramer's objections to the magistrate judge's order on this issue.\n\nAEP and the Plan then filed a dispositive motion labeled as a motion for summary judgment. The district court treated the motion as a motion for judgment on the administrative record, consistent with Sixth Circuit ERISA procedure. The court applied the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review after determining that the Plan granted the administrator discretionary authority to interpret the Plan and decide eligibility for benefits. On that standard, the district court concluded that Cox and the appeal committee had provided a reasonable, evidence-based explanation for determining that AEP terminated Kramer\u2019s employment \"for Cause\" under Plan \u00a7 2.5 and entered judgment in favor of AEP and the Plan on the denial-of-benefits claim.

He further maintains that ERISA should be construed in harmony with Internal Revenue Code provisions and related Treasury regulations, including those governing deferred compensation under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 409A, which he believes support his narrower view of \"deferred compensation.\"",
          "He argues that he was entitled to broader or \"full\" discovery beyond the administrative record in his ERISA denial-of-benefits claim, both because he asserted procedural irregularities and because, in his view, Supreme Court precedent has undermined Sixth Circuit limits on discovery in ERISA cases. He contends that limiting him to a narrow band of discovery\u2014principally into alleged conflicts of interest or bias\u2014deprived him of a fair opportunity to develop his claims.",

He argues that a claim under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) to recover benefits due under a plan involves a legal remedy analogous to a contract damages action, and therefore falls within the Seventh Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a jury trial for suits at common law. He argues that because other ERISA provisions expressly limit recovery to \"equitable relief\" while \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) does not, Congress intended that \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) provide for legal remedies, triggering a jury-trial right.

They contend that this evidence reasonably supports the determination that Kramer was terminated \"for Cause\" under both Plan \u00a7 2.5(v) and \u00a7 2.5(ii), rendering him ineligible for severance benefits, and that no genuine factual dispute, even if considered under Rule 56, would alter that conclusion."

During the marriage, the Decedent acquired pension and annuity benefits through his employment and, in 1984, he executed designation forms naming Wood as the primary beneficiary and his father as contingent beneficiary (the \"Designation Forms\"). In 2006, when the Decedent and Wood divorced, they entered into a Property Settlement Agreement (the \"PSA\"). Under paragraph (D)(3) of the PSA, the Decedent was to retain all pensions and annuities acquired by him at any time, including during the marriage, and Wood expressly waived any claims she might have in and to those benefits, \"including the right to be named as a survivor beneficiary.\" The Decedent, however, did not change the Designation Forms and Wood remained listed as the primary beneficiary, with the Decedent's father as contingent beneficiary.\n\nAfter the Decedent's death in 2013, Wood claimed and accepted the Decedent's annuity and pension benefits based on her continued designation as primary beneficiary on the 1984 forms. The Estate contends that, by virtue of the PSA, Wood had waived all rights to those benefits, so that on the Decedent's death the benefits should have gone to the Decedent's father as the contingent beneficiary. Upon learning that Wood had claimed and accepted the benefits, the Decedent's father assigned to Vivienne Culwick, as administratrix of the Estate, any claims he had against Wood for the pension and annuity benefits. The Estate then pursued those assigned claims against Wood.",

The court denied Wood\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim. The court also granted summary judgment to Wood on the Estate\u2019s other claims and granted summary judgment to the Estate on Wood\u2019s counterclaims; those rulings are not challenged on appeal.\n\nWood moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) for reconsideration of the summary judgment ruling and, in the alternative, for certification of an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). In an August 14, 2019 Memorandum and Order (Culwick II, 2019 WL 9663013), the district court reconsidered its prior decision but adhered to its original determinations, and denied interlocutory certification.\n\nOn the issue of damages, Magistrate Judge Cheryl L. Pollak issued a Report and Recommendation (R&R) on September 9, 2021 (Culwick III, 2021 WL 7906500).

She recommended denial, without prejudice, of the Estate\u2019s request for prejudgment interest on the pension benefit award, pending additional information, and also recommended post-judgment interest.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, the district judge issued a Memorandum and Order (Culwick IV, 2022 WL 16230836), rejecting the parties\u2019 objections and adopting the R&R in its entirety. After the Estate submitted an additional affidavit, Magistrate Judge Pollak issued a further R&R on May 15, 2023 (Culwick V, 2023 WL 4490367), recommending an additional $15,823.98 in prejudgment interest on the pension benefit award. The district judge adopted this recommendation by order reflected in a July 12, 2023 docket minute entry.

The Estate argues that Wood has not identified any additional evidence she could have presented that would be material under New Jersey\u2019s objective test for third-party beneficiary status.",

Thus, it maintains that continuous accrual of prejudgment interest was equitable.",

          "The Estate further contends that the hours billed in 2015 and 2016 are compensable because the unsuccessful conversion and unjust enrichment claims arose from the same common core of facts and related legal theories as the successful breach of contract claim\u2014namely, Wood\u2019s agreement in the PSA not to claim the Decedent\u2019s annuity and pension benefits. It emphasizes that it ultimately obtained all of the monetary relief sought, supporting compensation for work on related unsuccessful claims. As to 2019\u20132020 billing, the Estate defends the 10% across-the-board reduction as a reasonable exercise of discretion in light of the overall reasonableness of the hours and the results achieved."

Under New Jersey\u2019s objective contract-interpretation rule, that language is clear and unambiguous: Wood bargained away any right to receive these benefits, even if she remained the named beneficiary of record. Her later collection of the proceeds is irreconcilable with that waiver. The argument that the PSA left room for the decedent to keep her as a beneficiary contradicts the explicit waiver 'including the right to be named as a survivor beneficiary.' Because there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the only reasonable reading supports breach, de novo review supports affirming summary judgment for the Estate and denying Wood\u2019s cross\u2011motion."

By waiving any claim to the pensions and annuities and to survivor\u2011beneficiary status, the PSA necessarily contemplated that someone other than Wood would take those benefits on the decedent\u2019s death. That is a direct, not incidental, benefit to the person who would stand in her place. At the time of contracting, the contingent beneficiary was the decedent\u2019s father, who fits squarely within that contemplated class. The fact that Wood says she did not know or focus on the father\u2019s identity is not dispositive; New Jersey law does not require that the third party be named or even specifically known. On de novo review, treating the father as an intended third\u2011party beneficiary, whose claim could be assigned to the Estate, is a straightforward and reasonable application of New Jersey law, so the determination is properly affirmed."

Moreover, she does not identify specific additional, material evidence that she was prevented from offering; what she proffers\u2014her lack of subjective intent to benefit the father and lack of awareness of any contingent beneficiary\u2014is legally marginal given New Jersey\u2019s objective-intent test. Without both genuine surprise and concrete, material evidence that would have been offered, she cannot establish procedural prejudice.

Routine delay associated with discovery, even when discovery is reopened at the prevailing party\u2019s request, typically does not qualify. There is no indication of bad faith, deliberate dilatory conduct by the Estate, or court\u2011ordered suspension of the case; the delays appear to be ordinary incidents of litigation. Nor is there a factor such as lack of insurance or some manifest inequity that New Jersey precedents cite as justifying tolling.

On this record, $400\/hour for an experienced litigator in the Eastern District of New York over a multi\u2011year federal case is within the range of prevailing rates; Wood\u2019s proposed $350 figure is simply a competing judgment, not evidence that $400 is unreasonable. As to hours, the unsuccessful conversion and unjust\u2011enrichment claims shared a common core of facts and legal theories with the contract claim and were part of a single litigation effort that achieved essentially full monetary relief. New Jersey law permits compensating such intertwined time. The magistrate judge\u2019s and district court\u2019s calibrated 10% reduction for potential excess work in 2019\u20132020 demonstrates active scrutiny rather than rubber\u2011stamping.

      "reasoning":"All challenged rulings align with settled New Jersey and federal standards, and the district court repeatedly revisited and explained its conclusions. The contract language is strongly against Wood; her waiver of 'the right to be named as a survivor beneficiary' is difficult to reconcile with her later collection of benefits. The third\u2011party\u2011beneficiary ruling follows directly from that waiver: someone had to take the benefits Wood surrendered, and the decedent\u2019s father was the identified contingent beneficiary. Wood\u2019s claimed lack of subjective intent or knowledge is not controlling under New Jersey\u2019s objective test. Her procedural\u2011prejudice argument is undermined by the record\u2019s repeated treatment of the third\u2011party\u2011beneficiary theory and her failure to show any material evidence she was precluded from offering. On remedies, New Jersey law vests broad discretion in trial courts for prejudgment interest and fee awards; there is no showing of the kind of exceptional circumstances that would mandate tolling interest, nor of a clearly excessive rate or hours. The district court used recognized methods (lodestar, percentage reduction) and gave reasoned explanations. Taken together, these factors point strongly toward affirmance across all issues."

        "appellee":"Jessica Gessele, Ashley Ortiz, Nicole Gessele, Tricia Tetrault, and Christina Mauldin, on behalf of themselves and similarly situated former employees of Jack in the Box; plaintiffs in the district court and cross\u2011appellants on unpaid meal\u2011break and shoe\u2011deduction issues."
      },
      "factual_background":"Jack in the Box Inc. (JITB) employed the named plaintiffs at its Oregon restaurants at various times; all of the named plaintiffs left JITB by March 29, 2010. By 2011, JITB had sold all of its Oregon restaurants to franchisees and, after September 30, 2011, had no Oregon employees.\n\nWorkers\u2019 Benefit Fund (WBF) deductions: Oregon funds the Workers\u2019 Benefit Fund (WBF) through an hourly assessment split equally between employers and employees. In 2003 the total assessment was 3.6 cents per hour worked; employers were to deduct 1.8 cents per hour from employee pay and contribute an additional 1.8 cents per hour themselves, remitting 3.6 cents per hour in total to the state. JITB administered WBF deductions through a payroll software system called Lawson. JITB initially programmed Lawson to deduct 1.8 cents per hour from all hourly Oregon employees, which was accurate when the total rate was 3.6 cents per hour.\n\nOver subsequent years, Oregon reduced the WBF assessment rates. JITB adjusted the total amounts it remitted to the state to match the reduced rates but did not adjust the 1.8 cents-per-hour amount it deducted from employees. As a result, during the class period employees consistently paid more than half of the required WBF assessment while JITB paid less than half. The over\u2011deductions by year, compared to what each side should have paid, were as follows:\n- 2004\u20132005: total 3.4\u00a2\/hr; employees paid 1.8\u00a2\/hr (should have paid 1.7\u00a2); JITB paid 1.6\u00a2\/hr\n- 2006: total 3.0\u00a2\/hr; employees paid 1.8\u00a2\/hr (should have paid 1.5\u00a2); JITB paid 1.2\u00a2\/hr\n- 2007\u20132011: total 2.8\u00a2\/hr; employees paid 1.8\u00a2\/hr (should have paid 1.4\u00a2); JITB paid 1.0\u00a2\/hr\n\nThe over\u2011deductions per employee were small, at most 0.4 cents per hour, amounting to less than $2 over eight years for about half of the employees and never more than $32 from any individual. Across all Oregon employees and the full period of over\u2011deductions, JITB overdeducted roughly $22,000. JITB contends it first discovered the error and corrected the employee deduction rate in February 2012, after it no longer had Oregon employees. Plaintiffs assert JITB acted willfully in failing to update and correct the deduction rate.\n\nUnpaid meal breaks: JITB generally provided unpaid 30\u2011minute meal periods for employees working shifts longer than six hours, consistent with Oregon regulations requiring a 30\u2011minute unpaid meal period during which an employee is relieved of all duties. When business was busy, JITB managers sometimes recalled employees before the 30 minutes elapsed. JITB maintained a policy of treating a break as an unpaid meal period, and not compensable time, so long as the employee had at least 20 minutes off. Thus, if a 30\u2011minute break was cut to 25 minutes, JITB would pay the employee only for the 5 minutes they returned to work early but not for the remaining 25 minutes; if the break was reduced below 20 minutes (e.g., to 18 minutes), JITB treated the entire 18 minutes as compensable work time and paid for it. JITB maintains that it paid employees for every minute they actually worked, including minutes worked when meal periods were shortened, and that only the unpaid portion of time during the nominal 30\u2011minute break was unpaid.\n\nShoe deductions: Before 2003 JITB did not require a specific shoe vendor; employees could wear any slip\u2011resistant shoes. JITB became concerned about the frequency and cost of employee slip\u2011and\u2011fall incidents at its restaurants; its employees were injured 25% more frequently than the industry average, and JITB was experiencing more than $3 million per year in slip\u2011and\u2011fall claims. In response, JITB decided to mandate that employees wear non\u2011slip shoes purchased from specified vendors. It considered proposals from two vendors, Shoes for Crews and Footstar. Under Shoes for Crews\u2019 proposal, employees would pay approximately $2 more per pair than under Footstar\u2019s proposal, but Shoes for Crews agreed to pay a $2 per\u2011pair rebate to JITB. Shoes for Crews also agreed to indemnify JITB for certain injuries suffered by employees wearing its shoes, while Footstar offered no such indemnity.\n\nJITB selected Shoes for Crews as the mandated vendor and required employees to purchase that brand of non\u2011slip shoes. During the relevant period, employees could elect to pay for their Shoes for Crews footwear through payroll deductions. If they elected that option, JITB ordered the shoes directly from Shoes for Crews, the employees signed written authorizations for wage deductions, and JITB recouped the shoe cost in three or four installments from subsequent paychecks. JITB then remitted the price to Shoes for Crews and received the $2 per\u2011pair rebate. Over time, JITB collected more than $1 million in vendor rebates and approximately $295,000 in indemnity payments from Shoes for Crews. Plaintiffs assert that the shoe deductions were not for the employees\u2019 ultimate benefit and that JITB\u2019s receipt of rebates and indemnities at employees\u2019 expense rendered the deductions unlawful.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Starting in August 2010, various named plaintiffs brought multiple suits in federal court against JITB relating to Oregon wage\u2011and\u2011hour practices. The litigation involved shifting party alignments and jurisdictional disputes until the operative complaint was filed in June 2014. In that operative complaint, plaintiffs asserted: (1) claims based on alleged over\u2011deductions from wages for WBF contributions in violation of Oregon wage deduction and final pay statutes, and seeking restitution of the over\u2011deducted amounts plus statutory penalty wages and prejudgment interest; (2) claims for unpaid wages relating to shortened meal periods, arguing JITB was required to pay wages for entire 30\u2011minute meal periods when breaks were interrupted and that Oregon law entitled employees to compensation for meal breaks shortened to between 20 and 30 minutes; and (3) claims challenging deductions from wages for mandatory non\u2011slip shoes, asserting violations of Oregon wage deduction law (including ORS 652.610 and 652.615) and Oregon minimum wage and overtime law (ORS 653.010\u2013653.261 and 653.055), particularly where shoe deductions allegedly pushed employees below the minimum wage or resulted in underpayment of overtime.",
        "district_court_decision":"Class certification: In June 2017, the district court certified two Rule 23(b)(3) classes: a WBF class to challenge the alleged over\u2011deductions for WBF contributions, and a shoe class to challenge the non\u2011slip shoe wage deductions. It declined to certify a class for unpaid meal\u2011break claims, finding that liability would depend on individualized determinations of why each break was shortened (e.g., voluntary early return versus management recall) and thus common issues did not predominate for the break claims. The court appointed a class administrator and approved notice to approximately 5,105 class members; 856 notices were returned as undeliverable. The court later refused to exclude the undeliverable\u2011notice group, finding that the mailed notice was the best practicable.\n\nSummary judgment: After cross\u2011motions for summary judgment, the district court issued rulings narrowing the issues. It held: (1) that JITB\u2019s over\u2011deductions for WBF contributions were willful under Oregon law, entitling plaintiffs to pursue penalty wages under ORS 652.150; (2) that JITB\u2019s shoe\u2011deduction program met the statutory requirement that deductions be \u201cfor the employee\u2019s benefit\u201d under ORS 652.610(3)(b), thereby establishing an affirmative defense on that element; and (3) in a footnote, that the parties had agreed the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cfinal paycheck\u201d penalty claims related only to a so\u2011called Franchise Transfer Class and were not derivative of other wage\u2011violation theories. The court later denied two renewed motions by plaintiffs to certify an unpaid\u2011break class, reasoning that even in light of newly cited Oregon authority (Maza v. Waterford Operations, LLC) the claims were not suitable for class treatment or did not apply retroactively to the named plaintiffs\u2019 time periods.\n\nClass status changes: For the shoe claims, JITB moved to decertify the shoe class; the district court initially denied decertification. At the pretrial conference, however, the court decertified the shoe class, concluding that in light of the earlier summary\u2011judgment ruling that shoes were for employees\u2019 benefit, the remaining shoe issues\u2014particularly written authorization for deductions\u2014required individualized proof and that common issues no longer predominated.\n\nTrial: The case proceeded to a jury trial on the remaining issues, including WBF class damages and certain individual claims for unpaid breaks and shoe deductions. Plaintiffs advanced a WBF penalty\u2011wage damages theory that the parties labeled \"Late Final Pay 1,\" seeking penalty wages based on late or underpaid final paychecks caused solely by WBF over\u2011deductions (without necessarily showing minimum wage or overtime violations). JITB objected, arguing the theory had been waived and that the earlier summary\u2011judgment footnote limited final\u2011paycheck claims to the separate franchise\u2011transfer context. The trial judge revisited the prior ruling, concluded plaintiffs had not abandoned the Late Final Pay 1 theory, and allowed the jury to consider it.\n\nThe jury returned verdicts on the outstanding claims. On the WBF class claim, it found that some class members had been paid less than minimum wage, underpaid overtime, and\/or paid final wages late due to the WBF over\u2011deductions, determined the compensatory amount of WBF over\u2011deductions within the statute of limitations to be approximately $13,468.37, and awarded multiple categories of damages including statutory penalty wages and prejudgment interest. For the named plaintiffs\u2019 individual shoe claims, the jury found that each plaintiff had authorized the shoe deductions in writing and awarded no statutory damages specifically for wrongful deductions, but awarded penalty wages reflecting both WBF and shoe\u2011related violations. The jury also awarded damages to the named plaintiffs on their unpaid meal\u2011break claims.\n\nPost\u2011trial rulings: JITB filed post\u2011trial motions. On the individual shoe claims, the district court granted JITB\u2019s motion in part, holding that because the jury found written authorization for the shoe deductions and because the court viewed such written authorization as a complete defense to all statutory shoe claims, plaintiffs could not recover penalty wages under the shoe theories. The court reduced the named plaintiffs\u2019 penalty\u2011wage award to the amount attributable solely to the WBF violations. Regarding the WBF class, JITB moved to reduce or set aside the penalty\u2011wage award on due process grounds, arguing the aggregate penalty was grossly disproportionate to actual damages. The district court rejected this challenge and upheld the statutory penalty\u2011wage award. JITB also requested that the court toll or reduce prejudgment interest on the ground that plaintiffs had allegedly delayed the litigation through unreasonable litigation choices and class\u2011certification efforts. The district court refused, concluding under Oregon law that prejudgment interest on liquidated amounts is mandatory once damages are ascertainable and that it lacked discretion to exclude periods of delay attributable to plaintiffs.\n\nAfter entering an initial judgment reflecting the verdicts and these rulings, JITB filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) under Rule 50(b) on the named plaintiffs\u2019 individual unpaid break claims. On August 8, 2023, the district court granted the renewed JMOL, holding that under Oregon law in effect before June 1, 2010, employers were not obligated to pay for the entire 30\u2011minute meal period when employees were called back to work early and that none of the named plaintiffs worked for JITB after the June 2010 regulatory amendment. The court struck the unpaid\u2011break award from the judgment. On September 2, 2023, the court entered an amended judgment incorporating the grant of JMOL, the reduced penalty\u2011wage award for the named plaintiffs, and the WBF class award (including prejudgment interest).\n\nNotice and class\u2011member issues: In connection with class administration, JITB argued that the approximately 17% of class members whose mailed notices were undeliverable should be excluded from the class and that any class\u2011wide damages award should not include amounts for them. The district court denied that request, finding that individual mailed notice to all reasonably identifiable members had been attempted, that no better practicable notice method had been identified, and that Rule 23 did not require actual notice to each individual class member.\n\nCross\u2011appeal timing: JITB filed a notice of appeal on September 6, 2023, within 30 days of the amended judgment. Plaintiffs filed a notice of cross\u2011appeal on October 1, 2023. JITB later argued on appeal that the cross\u2011appeal was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the August 8, 2023 order granting JITB\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion, but plaintiffs contended that the operative 30\u2011day period ran from entry of the amended judgment.",

It contends there is evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that JITB did not know it was over\u2011deducting WBF contributions, including testimony that it first learned of the issue in February 2012, after all Oregon employees and operations had ceased. JITB maintains that any error was an innocent, non\u2011careless miscalculation involving very small amounts per employee, that it reasonably relied on its commercial payroll software (Lawson) to apply updated rates, and that plaintiffs offered no contrary evidence such as software manuals or communications showing JITB knew it needed to manually reset the employee rate when the total WBF rate changed. It argues the district court improperly inferred knowledge and willfulness merely from JITB\u2019s correct updating of the total remittance to the state and from the possibility that JITB could have double\u2011checked the employee rate.",
          "On Late Final Pay 1 waiver and reconsideration: JITB contends that plaintiffs previously represented to the court that they were not seeking \"derivative final\u2011paycheck\" penalties based solely on nonpayment of wages during employment and that the court had indicated final\u2011paycheck claims were confined to the franchise\u2011transfer context. JITB argues that allowing plaintiffs to pursue the Late Final Pay 1 theory at trial, after Judge Brown had construed plaintiffs\u2019 briefing as a surrender of that theory, amounted to impermissible appellate\u2011type review by Judge Hern\u00e1ndez and unfairly prejudiced JITB by expanding plaintiffs\u2019 penalty\u2011wage theories late in the proceedings. It also contends that plaintiffs should be judicially estopped from changing their position regarding the scope of their final\u2011paycheck claims.",
          "On constitutional limits of WBF penalty wages: JITB maintains that the class\u2019s statutory penalty\u2011wage award is grossly disproportionate to the actual harm of roughly $13,468.37 in WBF over\u2011deductions within the limitations period, producing a penalty\u2011to\u2011actual\u2011damages ratio near 400:1. It argues that the district court erred by analyzing only some of the Wakefield\/Six Mexican Workers factors and by ignoring that Oregon\u2019s penalty\u2011wage statute is primarily punitive rather than compensatory, as well as by refusing to consider the ratio between the statutory penalties and actual economic loss. It asserts that the magnitude of the aggregated penalty is unconstitutional in light of the small, technical nature of the underlying violations and JITB\u2019s limited culpability.",
          "On class notice and undeliverable mail: JITB argues that because approximately 17% of mailed class notices were returned as undeliverable and the court did not attempt any alternative forms of notice (e.g., email, social media, or remailing), notice was not the best practicable under the circumstances and class members who did not receive actual notice should have been excluded. JITB contends that including them in the class and in damages calculations creates a risk that funds attributable to those individuals will be distributed to the smaller group of members who received notice, potentially resulting in a windfall to those members and prejudice to JITB.",
          "On prejudgment interest: JITB asserts that even if prejudgment interest is generally mandatory under ORS 82.010, Oregon courts have not squarely barred courts from tolling interest during periods of delay caused by a plaintiff, and comparable jurisdictions have recognized such discretion. It argues plaintiffs significantly delayed the case through unsuccessful legal and class\u2011certification strategies (such as pressing a joint\u2011employer theory and repeatedly moving to certify break\u2011time classes), and that equity and full consideration of the statute\u2019s remedial purpose should allow courts to reduce interest for such periods to avoid rewarding delay and overcompensating plaintiffs.",
          "On timeliness of the cross\u2011appeal: JITB contends that, under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4), when a Rule 50(b) motion is decided, any appeal of that ruling must be filed within 30 days of the order, regardless of later entry of an amended judgment, and therefore plaintiffs\u2019 cross\u2011appeal, filed more than 30 days after the August 8, 2023 order granting JMOL on the break claims, is untimely.",
          "On unpaid\u2011break class certification: JITB argues that even after Maza, plaintiffs\u2019 proposed meal\u2011break class is improper because Maza\u2019s strict\u2011liability\/pay\u2011for\u2011shortened\u2011break rule does not apply retroactively to the pre\u2011June 2010 period when plaintiffs were employed. Relying on Gafur and an Oregon trial\u2011court decision, JITB maintains that Oregon law before June 2010 did not require employers to pay for the full 30 minutes of a shortened meal period and only required payment for actual work time during the break. Since all named plaintiffs ceased employment by March 2010, JITB argues they have no viable unpaid\u2011break wage claim and therefore cannot represent a class that would necessarily include post\u20112010 employees; typicality and standing are lacking.",
          "On JMOL for unpaid\u2011break individual claims: JITB supports the district court\u2019s grant of JMOL by emphasizing that all named plaintiffs\u2019 employment ended before the June 2010 regulatory amendment and that, under then\u2011existing law, JITB was not required to convert interrupted 30\u2011minute breaks into paid periods; the jury therefore had no legal basis to award unpaid\u2011break wages. JITB further maintains that plaintiffs waived any breach\u2011of\u2011contract theory based on On\u2011Duty Meal Policy Agreements by expressly telling the court they were not asserting breach\u2011of\u2011contract claims, introducing those agreements solely to support willfulness, and failing to invoke them in response to JITB\u2019s JMOL motions.",
          "On shoe deductions as 'for employees\u2019 benefit': JITB argues that the shoe\u2011deduction program ultimately benefited employees by reducing the risk of workplace injuries, offering convenient access to approved slip\u2011resistant footwear, and allegedly providing a discount. It contends that under ORS 652.610(3)(b), a deduction need not benefit only the employee and that the statute allows deductions that provide mutual benefits to employer and employee. JITB asserts that plaintiffs\u2019 focus on rebates and indemnities ignores the overarching safety benefits and that no reasonable jury could find the shoe requirement was not for employees\u2019 benefit.",
          "On shoe class decertification and written authorization: For ORS 652.615 claims, JITB argues that once the district court correctly resolved the 'benefit' issue in its favor at summary judgment, the only remaining disputed element was whether each employee had given written authorization for deductions, an issue that is necessarily individualized and predominates over common questions, justifying decertification. For ORS 653.055 claims, JITB maintains that written authorization and employee benefit under ORS 652.610(3)(b) also operate as defenses to wage\u2011underpayment theories and that individualized questions of authorization made class treatment inappropriate.",
          "On overriding the jury\u2019s shoe\u2011related penalty\u2011wage award: JITB supports the district court\u2019s post\u2011trial decision to strike penalty wages awarded on shoe\u2011based minimum wage\/overtime theories, contending that once the jury found written authorization and the court had held the shoe deductions lawful and for the employees\u2019 benefit, there was no legal basis for penalty wages connected to shoe deductions, even if such deductions might have coincided with low wage levels."

They maintain that JITB\u2019s failure to verify or adjust the employee rate in light of each year\u2019s updated state notice and its ability to cross\u2011check payroll outputs support a finding of willfulness as a matter of law, not merely negligence. Plaintiffs rely on statutory presumptions that individuals intend the natural consequences of their acts and exercise ordinary business care, and they assert JITB cannot negate willfulness simply by claiming an unexplained software or administrative error.",
          "On Late Final Pay 1 and reconsideration: Plaintiffs contend they never disclaimed the Late Final Pay 1 theory. They argue that their earlier briefing distinguished derivative penalty\u2011wage theories (solely for prior underpayments) from a separate franchise\u2011transfer final\u2011paycheck class, but did not surrender the right to seek penalty wages for late or underpaid final checks caused by WBF over\u2011deductions. They maintain that Judge Hern\u00e1ndez permissibly corrected a clear misreading of their earlier submissions, that such interlocutory reconsideration is expressly permitted, and that JITB suffered no unfair surprise because the factual basis for the theory was in the record and long\u2011known. Plaintiffs also contend judicial estoppel is inapplicable because they did not take inconsistent positions and JITB waived the doctrine by not raising it below.",
          "On constitutional limits and penalty\u2011wage purpose: Plaintiffs argue that Oregon\u2019s penalty\u2011wage statute is designed to deter employers from failing to pay wages when due and to encourage compliance with wage laws, and that the legislature is authorized to impose significant penalties to achieve deterrence and ensure uniform adherence. They maintain the district court properly considered the scale, duration, and class\u2011wide nature of JITB\u2019s violations and that the award is justified given the number of affected employees and the statutory policy favoring full and timely payment. They assert that focusing narrowly on a mathematical ratio between penalties and actual harm would undercut the deterrent and punitive purposes of the statute.",
          "On class notice and undeliverable notices: Plaintiffs argue that the district court satisfied Rule 23 by directing individual mailed notice to all identifiable class members and that neither the Rule nor due process requires actual notice to every class member. They note that JITB never proposed feasible additional steps, such as email or social media notice, or showed that email addresses or appropriate online fora were available. Plaintiffs emphasize that former fast\u2011food workers are not inherently transient in the way some other populations might be, and that including individuals whose notices were returned unopened does not prejudice JITB because any distribution of unclaimed funds can be managed by the court in a manner consistent with class\u2011action practice.",
          "On prejudgment interest: Plaintiffs assert that under ORS 82.010 and Oregon precedent, once damages (here, the amounts over\u2011deducted and fixed penalty wages) become ascertainable and the due date is known, prejudgment interest is mandatory and not subject to case\u2011specific equitable reductions. They argue that JITB\u2019s proposed approach\u2014asking courts to parse litigation strategy and assign delay responsibility\u2014would defeat the statute\u2019s goal of compensating employees for the full time their money was withheld, encourage satellite litigation about blame for delays, and leave employees undercompensated for the use value of their wages during protracted litigation.",
          "On cross\u2011appeal timeliness: Plaintiffs contend that because the district court granted JITB\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion and then entered an amended judgment incorporating that ruling, Ninth Circuit decisions like Southern Union and Webb require measuring the appeal period from entry of the amended judgment rather than from the earlier order. They maintain that their cross\u2011appeal, filed within 30 days of the amended judgment, is therefore timely under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4).",
          "On unpaid\u2011break class certification and Maza: Plaintiffs argue that Maza held an employer is responsible for ensuring a full 30\u2011minute, duty\u2011free meal period and must pay for the entire period if the employee is not relieved for the full 30 minutes, regardless of why the employee returned early. They contend Maza\u2019s reasoning\u2014relying on the mandatory 'shall provide' language, the requirement of written waivers, and health\u2011based purposes\u2014applies to the pre\u2011June 2010 version of the regulation as well. They maintain that the district court\u2019s original focus on individualized reasons for shortened breaks is inconsistent with Maza\u2019s strict\u2011liability framework and that such legal error wrongly prevented class certification. Plaintiffs argue that, to the extent the 2010 regulatory amendment clarified rather than altered obligations, the pay\u2011for\u2011shortened\u2011break rule should apply retroactively or at least inform pre\u2011amendment practice.",
          "On unpaid\u2011break JMOL and contract theory: Plaintiffs challenge the grant of JMOL on their individual break claims, asserting that Maza demonstrates Oregon employers were always obliged to enforce a full 30\u2011minute meal break and pay wages for shortened breaks. They also contend that JITB\u2019s On\u2011Duty Meal Policy Agreements created contractual obligations that JITB breached by recalling employees early or failing to enforce promised terms. Plaintiffs argue that the On\u2011Duty Agreements were in evidence at trial, that the jury instructions reflected the agreements\u2019 substance (e.g., distinguishing voluntary from involuntary early returns), and that the district court should have considered this contract\u2011based theory when evaluating JMOL rather than limiting analysis to regulatory wage\u2011law language.",
          "On shoe deductions and 'benefit' requirement: Plaintiffs argue that the employer bears the burden to prove the shoe deductions were for the 'ultimate benefit' of employees and that JITB\u2019s financial incentives\u2014a $2 per\u2011pair rebate and indemnification against certain injury costs\u2014show that the dominant purpose of the required purchase program was to reduce JITB\u2019s own expenses and generate revenue from employees\u2019 purchases, not to benefit employees. They note that employees were compelled to purchase from a single vendor at a higher price than at least one competitor and that any asserted 'benefits' (such as off\u2011duty use or an unspecified discount) were speculative or unsupported by the record. Plaintiffs contend that a reasonable jury could find the shoe program was not for employees\u2019 ultimate benefit and that summary judgment on this affirmative defense improperly removed the question from the jury.",
          "On shoe class certification and written authorization: Regarding ORS 652.615 claims, plaintiffs argue that whether deductions were \"for the employee\u2019s benefit\" is a common legal and factual question that predominates and that, if the employer fails on this element, written authorization cannot cure an otherwise unlawful deduction. They maintain that the district court\u2019s decertification decision rested on its earlier legal error about benefit and should be revisited. For ORS 653.055 minimum\u2011wage and overtime shoe claims, plaintiffs argue that ORS 652.610\u2019s written\u2011authorization provision does not govern minimum\u2011wage compliance; the key question is whether net wages after deductions fell below statutory minimum or overtime rates, which can be determined using payroll data without individualized inquiries into written authorization.",
          "On the scope of written\u2011authorization defenses: Plaintiffs contend that ORS 652.610(3)(b) and its written\u2011authorization requirement apply only to wrongful\u2011deduction liability and do not authorize an employer to count the cost of required equipment, such as shoes, toward satisfying minimum\u2011wage and overtime obligations. They emphasize that ORS 653.055 and 653.035 contain their own, narrower rules for what may be credited against minimum wages (e.g., lodging, meals, or other facilities\/services furnished for the private benefit of the employee) and that these provisions make no reference to written authorization. Therefore, plaintiffs argue, even if the shoe deductions were authorized and for the employees\u2019 benefit for deduction purposes, JITB could still be liable under ORS 653.055 for paying less than minimum wage or required overtime because the shoe costs cannot be offset against wage obligations.",
          "On overriding the jury\u2019s shoe\u2011related penalty\u2011wage award: Plaintiffs argue that the jury properly awarded penalty wages for shoe claims under ORS 653.055 based on findings that shoe deductions contributed to minimum\u2011wage or overtime underpayments. They assert the district court erred by viewing written authorization and employee benefit as dispositive for those claims and by reducing the jury\u2019s penalty\u2011wage award to exclude shoe\u2011related components. Plaintiffs maintain that the jury\u2019s verdict on the shoe claims should stand because ORS 653.055 liability turns on whether employees received required hourly and overtime pay, not on whether deductions were authorized."

The amounts were very small, and plaintiffs had no direct evidence that JITB knew the employee rate remained fixed while the total rate fell. Under Wilson and Sabin, non\u2011careless miscalculation is not willful. Resolving those competing inferences against JITB on summary judgment improperly removed a fact\u2011intensive question from the jury.

An employee cannot contract away the right to be paid statutory minimum wage or overtime. Accordingly, written authorization is not a defense to ORS 653.055 liability where deductions push pay below lawfully required levels. The district court erred by treating written authorization as a complete bar to shoe\u2011related minimum\u2011wage\/overtime claims and by overriding the jury\u2019s penalty\u2011wage awards that rested on those wage\u2011underpayment theories.

Those are likely to be affirmed. The one major employer\u2011side win is on WBF \u2018willfulness\u2019: Oregon cases caution against finding willfulness where the employer plausibly lacked actual knowledge, and the evidence of state of mind is circumstantial and disputed, making summary judgment inappropriate. That error affects entitlement to penalty wages and will likely require vacating or remanding that component for trial or further proceedings.\n\nOn plaintiffs\u2019 cross\u2011appeal, the break\u2011time rulings (denial of class certification and grant of JMOL) are likely to be upheld. The named plaintiffs\u2019 employment predates the June 2010 regulatory change, and Oregon authority does not clearly impose Maza\u2019s strict standard retroactively. Combined with plaintiffs\u2019 disavowal of a contract theory at trial, there is no solid basis to disturb the JMOL or the refusal to certify a break\u2011time class.\n\nBy contrast, the shoe\u2011deduction issues strongly favor plaintiffs. Taylor places the burden on employers to show deductions are for the \u2018ultimate benefit\u2019 of employees. JITB\u2019s significant rebates and indemnity payments, along with a mandated single vendor, create a triable dispute on the employer\u2019s predominant purpose. Granting summary judgment on that affirmative defense, and then decertifying the shoe class on the assumption only individualized authorization questions remained, were legal and Rule 23 errors. In addition, nothing in ORS 653.055 or 653.035 suggests that written authorization under the deduction statute immunizes an employer from minimum\u2011wage and overtime liability. The district court\u2019s post\u2011trial reduction of shoe\u2011related penalty wages thus rested on an incorrect statutory interpretation.\n\nTaken together, these conclusions yield a mixed result: affirmance on most WBF\u2011related procedural and remedial issues, reversal on WBF willfulness, and substantial reversal on the shoe\u2011deduction and class\u2011certification issues, with remand for further class\u2011wide and possibly individual proceedings on those claims."

      "factual_background":"In 2013, Diana Avdeeva, a citizen of Russia, married a United States citizen, Grigoriy Rogach. Shortly after the marriage, she filed an application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for lawful permanent-resident status. USCIS approved the application and granted her conditional permanent-resident status for two years because the marriage was less than two years old at the time of the grant, as provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1186a(a)(1).\n\nTo remove the conditional nature of her residence, Avdeeva and Rogach filed a joint I-751 petition. Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 216.4(b)(1), USCIS was required within ninety days of the properly filed petition either to waive the interview requirement and adjudicate the petition or to arrange an interview. USCIS neither scheduled the required interview nor waived the interview requirement within the ninety days, though it did issue a request for additional evidence in connection with its review of the petition.\n\nIn 2018, Avdeeva and Rogach divorced. Avdeeva informed USCIS of the divorce and requested that the pending joint I-751 petition be converted to a waiver petition under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 216.5(a)(1)(ii), which permits a waiver of the joint filing requirement where the marriage was entered into in good faith but later terminated other than by death. She submitted materials intended to show that her marriage to Rogach had been a bona fide marital relationship.\n\nIn 2019, with no action yet taken by USCIS on her I-751 petition, Avdeeva filed an application for naturalization. USCIS scheduled what was represented as a naturalization interview, but at that interview the immigration officer focused on the unresolved I-751 petition rather than the naturalization application. Thereafter, USCIS denied the I-751 petition on the ground that Avdeeva had not established that she entered into the marriage in good faith, terminated her conditional permanent-resident status, and placed her into removal proceedings. USCIS then administratively closed her naturalization case, asserting that it could not adjudicate her naturalization application while she was in removal proceedings.\n\nAs a result of these events, Avdeeva initiated litigation challenging USCIS's actions and its failure to act on her applications. The failure of USCIS to act within the regulatory and statutory timeframes, the denial of the I-751 petition, the termination of her status, the commencement of removal proceedings, and the closure of her naturalization application formed the factual basis for her suits, including the one that ultimately led to the present EAJA fee dispute.",

        "claims_brought":"Avdeeva filed two federal actions against USCIS and its officials in their official capacities. The first action (referred to as the 'APA suit') challenged USCIS\u2019s handling of her immigration matters, alleging violations of various immigration regulations, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and her right to due process. The second action, which is the underlying case for this appeal, alleged that USCIS failed to adjudicate her naturalization application within the statutorily mandated period and invoked 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b), asking the district court to take jurisdiction over her naturalization application.\n\nIn the \u00a7 1447(b) action, Avdeeva\u2019s core claim was that USCIS had not timely adjudicated her naturalization application, thus entitling her to have the district court either decide the application itself or remand it to USCIS with appropriate instructions. Separately, in the APA suit, she sought relief related to the agency\u2019s conduct concerning her I-751 petition, the termination of her status, and related procedural and substantive issues, including alleged regulatory and constitutional violations.",
        "district_court_decision":"In response to the two suits, the government filed motions to dismiss in each action. While those motions were pending, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement and filed a joint motion asking the district court to remand the matters to USCIS consistent with that agreement.\n\nUnder the settlement agreement, USCIS agreed, within sixty days of remand: (1) to terminate Avdeeva\u2019s removal proceedings; (2) to approve her I-751 petition; and (3) to conduct a new naturalization interview. USCIS further agreed that, if Avdeeva met all requirements for naturalization, it would administer her naturalization oath within the same sixty-day period. In exchange, Avdeeva agreed that, after USCIS performed under the settlement, she would voluntarily dismiss all pending claims and withdraw her claim for damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nThe district court granted the parties\u2019 joint request, remanding the \u00a7 1447(b) case to USCIS and staying the APA action. Following the remand, Avdeeva was naturalized in August 2020. She then voluntarily dismissed the APA suit. In the \u00a7 1447(b) action, the district court entered a judgment of dismissal \"in accordance with the parties' settlement agreement.\"\n\nAfter securing her naturalization and the dismissal of the actions pursuant to the settlement, Avdeeva filed a motion in the district court seeking attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, based on the litigation concerning her naturalization application. The district court denied the EAJA motion. The court concluded that special circumstances, namely the terms and nature of the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, would make an award of attorney\u2019s fees unjust.

      "factual_background":"Javier Del Rio, Colin Meunier, and Aaron Delaroche worked for Amazon at its Connecticut warehouse fulfillment centers. Amazon owns and operates warehouse facilities throughout Connecticut where merchandise is stored for fulfilling customer orders. The facilities at issue are BDL2, located in Windsor, Connecticut, and BDL3, located in North Haven, Connecticut. Meunier and Delaroche worked at BDL2; Del Rio worked at BDL3. Del Rio and Delaroche initially were employed by Amazon.com Services, Inc., and Meunier by Amazon.com.dedc, LLC; those employing entities later merged, and Amazon.com Services, Inc. became Amazon.com Services LLC.\n\nBetween April 2018 and March 15, 2020, Amazon required employees at BDL2 and BDL3 to undergo mandatory security screenings when exiting the secured area of the fulfillment centers where merchandise was stored. The screenings were required only on exit from the secured area, not on entry. Every employee leaving the secured area was required to pass through a metal detector. The specific process depended on what personal belongings the employee chose to bring into the secured area:\n\n1. Employees with no items on their person could use an express lane and simply walk through the metal detector.\n2. Employees with items in their pockets used divesting tables, placing pocket items into a basket before passing through the metal detector.\n3. Employees carrying larger items (such as bags, lunch boxes, or purses) had to place those items on or through an X-ray machine while they themselves passed through the metal detector.\n\nIf either the employee or their items triggered an alarm, the employee was directed to a secondary screening and was \"wanded\" by a security guard. Amazon provided lockers outside the secured area, and employees could choose to store personal belongings there. If an employee chose instead to bring belongings into the secured area, that employee was required to go through the appropriate level of security screening whenever exiting the secured area for any reason, including to access breakrooms located outside the secured area, to leave the facility during breaks, or at the end of a shift.\n\nAmazon located its timeclocks so that employees had to clock out before undergoing the security screening. As a result, time spent in mandatory security screenings after clocking out was not recorded as work time and was not compensated. The length of time spent in security screening varied. One plaintiff estimated an average of about ten seconds; another estimated that the maximum usual time spent was three to four minutes, with the longest single instance being around ten minutes.\n\nAmazon discontinued these particular security screening procedures in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and, as of the time of depositions in the district court litigation, the procedures had not been resumed.",

Connecticut\u2019s statutory and regulatory text is broader than the federal Portal-to-Portal framework. Conn. Agencies Regs. \u00a7 31\u201160\u201111 explicitly defines hours worked to include \u201call time during which an employee is required by the employer to be on the employer\u2019s premises or to be on duty, or to be at the prescribed work place,\u201d and further includes time when the employee is required to wait on the premises even if no work is provided.

On the plain language, that time fits squarely within \u201chours worked.\u201d The district court effectively overlaid the Busk\/Portal\u2011to\u2011Portal analysis onto this broader state regulatory text and treated the post\u2011shift security check as non-compensable \u201cpostliminary\u201d activity. A de novo reviewing court is likely to find that this approach gives insufficient weight to the Connecticut regulation\u2019s inclusive definition and its waiting-time language, and that nothing in the Connecticut scheme narrows compensable \u201chours worked\u201d to exclude this kind of required on\u2011premises waiting and screening.

Connecticut decisions such as Williams and Belgada look to federal law as persuasive guidance where state language is parallel or ambiguous, but they do not hold that Connecticut silently adopted all federal limitations, particularly the Portal\u2011to\u2011Portal carve\u2011outs. Connecticut\u2019s overtime statute and, especially, its detailed regulatory definition of \u201chours worked\u201d were enacted and maintained without any express reference to the Portal\u2011to\u2011Portal Act, despite the legislature\u2019s ability to do so. The regulation affirmatively expands compensable time to all required on\u2011premises time and certain waiting periods, which is inconsistent with importing wholesale the narrower federal concept that excludes many post\u2011shift activities unless integral and indispensable to principal duties. Given this textual and structural difference, a court conducting de novo review is likely to reject the district court\u2019s conclusion that Connecticut implicitly incorporated the federal Portal\u2011to\u2011Portal limitations and Busk\u2019s specific holding on security screenings.

Nettleton indicates that Connecticut does recognize a common\u2011sense, fact\u2011specific de minimis concept, without a rigid numerical threshold. The record here shows that some employees spent only seconds, others several minutes, and occasionally up to about ten minutes in screening. On summary judgment, the district court treated the entire category of screening time as non\u2011compensable, not as compensable but potentially de minimis in specific, very short instances; the de minimis question was not the basis for dismissal. A reviewing court that concludes such time is in principle compensable is unlikely to hold, as a matter of law, that all such time is de minimis, because some instances (3\u20134 minutes routinely, and occasionally up to 10 minutes) are plainly more than trivial. At the same time, the appellate court will likely agree with the district court to the limited extent that Connecticut law permits treating truly trivial, hard\u2011to\u2011record increments as de minimis. Thus, the district court would be affirmed on the existence of a de minimis concept, but its summary judgment ruling cannot be sustained on that ground; the proper course is to remand for factual development on how much time was actually spent and whether any subset is de minimis. Accordingly, on the narrow legal question posed\u2014whether there is a de minimis exception\u2014the answer is yes, and the district court is effectively affirmed on that legal point while the case is remanded for further proceedings on compensability and damages."

That language, coupled with the absence of any express adoption of the Portal\u2011to\u2011Portal Act, supports treating mandatory exit security screening time as compensable under state law. The district court\u2019s reliance on Busk and on an implied incorporation of Portal\u2011to\u2011Portal limitations therefore rests on a legal conclusion that is vulnerable on appeal. At the same time, Connecticut precedent recognizes a flexible de minimis concept, so the appellate court will not reject the idea that very short, truly trivial increments of time might be non\u2011compensable under common\u2011sense principles. The likely disposition is to reverse the grant of summary judgment on the core questions of compensability and incorporation of federal standards, clarify that Connecticut law covers such required on\u2011premises screening time (subject to a possible de minimis carve\u2011out in appropriate factual circumstances), and remand for further proceedings rather than enter judgment for plaintiffs. That results in a mixed outcome: reversal on the main legal issues, but effective affirmance that Connecticut allows some de minimis treatment, with the case remanded for fact\u2011specific application of that doctrine and determination of any unpaid straight\u2011time and overtime wages and class certification issues not reached below."

      },
      "factual_background":"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. manufactures Eylea, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), an ophthalmological condition. Eylea is reimbursed under Medicare Part B as a 'buy and bill' drug, meaning physicians purchase the drug, prescribe and administer it in their offices, and then submit reimbursement claims to Medicare. Under Part B\u2019s cost-sharing rules, Medicare typically covers 80% of the drug\u2019s cost and the patient is responsible for the remaining 20%. Eylea is expensive: since 2013, Medicare Part B has spent over $11.5 billion on Eylea, one injection costs about $1,850, and patients require multiple injections per year, leading to annual co-pays that routinely exceed $2,000. For some patients, these co-pay obligations may deter use of Eylea. Although only a few drugs are FDA-approved for wet AMD, at least one significantly cheaper drug is available for off-label use, creating an economic incentive for patients and physicians to choose less costly alternatives if co-pays are high.\n\nThese cost dynamics create an incentive for the manufacturer to alleviate patients\u2019 co-pays so that Eylea is more attractive relative to alternatives. A drug priced, for example, at $1,850 with a $330 co-pay may be less attractive to patients than a higher list price drug effectively carrying no co-pay from the patient\u2019s perspective if the co-pay is covered. Insurers, not manufacturers, set the co-pay to ensure patients have financial responsibility in treatment decisions, but a patient who expects that the manufacturer (directly or indirectly) will cover the co-pay may effectively experience no cost-sharing burden.\n\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) criminalizes knowingly and willfully offering or paying remuneration to induce a person to purchase, lease, order, or recommend purchasing or ordering any item or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program. All parties assume, for purposes of this appeal, that a direct rebate or payment by a manufacturer of a Medicare patient\u2019s or doctor\u2019s co-pay would constitute a kickback under the AKS. Some manufacturers have attempted indirect arrangements by donating to ostensibly independent charitable foundations that provide copayment assistance to patients with particular diseases or conditions. The manufacturer donates to the foundation, and the foundation, in turn, furnishes co-pay assistance to patients (or to physicians on patients\u2019 behalf). Because such arrangements can function as conduits for improper remuneration, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued guidance to distinguish truly independent co-pay assistance programs from impermissible rebate conduits.\n\nIn this case, brought under the False Claims Act (FCA), the United States alleges that Regeneron crossed the line into an unlawful conduit arrangement by paying more than $60 million over four to five years to the Chronic Disease Fund (CDF), a charitable foundation that provides copayment assistance to patients suffering from wet AMD. The government contends that some or all of these donations were, in substance, remuneration intended to induce the use and purchase of Eylea by reducing or eliminating Medicare patients\u2019 co-pays, and therefore constituted unlawful kickbacks under the AKS. The government further alleges that when physicians prescribed Eylea to Medicare patients who received co-pay assistance funded by Regeneron\u2019s donations and then submitted Medicare Part B reimbursement claims for those Eylea treatments, those claims were tainted by the kickbacks. According to the government, the claims for Medicare reimbursement for Eylea administered to patients benefiting from that assistance were 'claims that include items or services resulting from' an AKS violation within the meaning of the 2010 amendment to the AKS, and thus are 'false or fraudulent' claims under the FCA.\n\nRegeneron disputes the government\u2019s causation theory. It maintains that a claim 'results from' an AKS violation, under the 2010 amendment, only if the illegal remuneration is a but-for cause of the provision of the items or services and the corresponding claim submitted to the government. Regeneron contends that if a physician would have prescribed Eylea and sought Medicare reimbursement regardless of the copay assistance funded by Regeneron\u2019s donations to CDF, then the Medicare claim does not 'result from' any alleged AKS violation.",

Regeneron argued that the amendment requires the government to prove that an AKS violation actually caused a physician to provide different medical treatment and thus caused the claims at issue, i.e., that the illegal remuneration was a but-for cause of the challenged claims. The government argued that causation was satisfied if a patient was exposed to an illegal inducement and the provider submitted a claim for services to that patient, even if the claim would have been submitted absent the inducement. The district court, relying on decisions from the Sixth and Eighth Circuits, interpreted 'resulting from' in the 2010 amendment as imposing a but-for causation requirement for purposes of establishing falsity under that amendment. The court also determined that, notwithstanding that interpretation, the government had offered sufficient evidence to create a triable issue on but-for causation and therefore to withstand summary judgment on that element. Observing a conflict in case law among circuits and emphasizing that the causation standard was pivotal to this case and to at least one other similar case in the District of Massachusetts, the district court certified its causation ruling for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).",

However, courts may adopt alternative causal standards when the statutory text or overall structure and purpose indicate that a strict but-for requirement would undermine congressional intent.

          "The government emphasizes that the Anti-Kickback Statute\u2019s 'animating principle' is that financial conflicts of interest can themselves corrupt medical decisionmaking. It notes that criminal liability under the AKS does not require proof that an illegal payment actually changed a physician\u2019s conduct or caused a particular claim; rather, the statute focuses on the offer or payment of remuneration to induce referrals or purchases. According to the government, because the 2010 amendment was 'built on' the AKS and designed to strengthen its enforcement through the FCA, the amendment should not impose a more demanding causation standard than the AKS itself effectively requires.",
          "The government asserts that Congress enacted the 2010 amendment against a backdrop of 'false-certification' FCA decisions that allowed FCA liability based on AKS violations without any but-for causation element. Those cases held that falsely representing compliance with the AKS, where compliance was material to payment, rendered claims false under the FCA. The government argues that Congress\u2019s adoption of the 2010 amendment should be understood as codifying and expanding that regime, not narrowing it by adding a strict but-for causation requirement that had not previously existed in AKS-based FCA cases.",
          "The United States points to the legislative history of the 2010 amendment, including statements by Senator Ted Kaufman, indicating that Congress intended to 'ensure that all claims resulting from illegal kickbacks are false or fraudulent, even when the claims are not submitted directly by the wrongdoers themselves.' It cites the example of Thomas v. Bailey, where FCA liability was not found in a kickback situation because the hospital submitting claims had not itself falsely certified AKS compliance. The government contends that the amendment was meant to close that type of gap and facilitate FCA enforcement without requiring proof that the kickback was a but-for cause of individual claims.",
          "The government argues that imposing a but-for standard would unduly hamper enforcement because it is often difficult to prove why a particular physician prescribed a given drug or used a particular device. It contends that requiring a showing that the claim would not have been submitted absent the kickback would create significant evidentiary obstacles and undermine the practical effect of the 2010 amendment, contrary to Congress\u2019s objective of strengthening fraud enforcement in the healthcare context."

United States, which interpret similar language ('results from,' 'as a result of') as imposing but-for causation in the absence of contrary textual or contextual indications.",
          "Regeneron contends that the government\u2019s proposed 'exposure' standard is inconsistent with the statutory language because it does not require any actual causal effect of the kickback on the decision to prescribe the drug or submit the claim. Under the government\u2019s theory, claims could be deemed to 'result from' an AKS violation even if the illegal payment had no influence at all on the physician\u2019s treatment decision or the patient\u2019s use of Eylea. Regeneron maintains that this would effectively read the causation requirement out of the statute.",
          "Regeneron argues that there is no textual indication in the 2010 amendment itself that Congress intended to depart from the ordinary but-for causation standard. Nor, in its view, does the broader statutory context or legislative history suggest that Congress meant to impose a more relaxed causation standard. Regeneron notes that Congress could have specified that any claim associated with an AKS violation is automatically false under the FCA but instead chose language that conditions falsity on the claim 'resulting from' the violation.",
          "Regeneron distinguishes the AKS\u2019s criminal provisions from the civil FCA context, arguing that it is neither unusual nor problematic for related criminal and civil statutes to have different elements or evidentiary requirements. The AKS\u2019s criminal prohibition on offering or paying remuneration to induce referrals serves the distinct purpose of protecting patients and policing conflicts of interest, whereas the FCA\u2019s civil remedies are primarily remedial and aimed at recouping money paid out by the government due to fraud. Regeneron argues that it is therefore reasonable for FCA liability under the 2010 amendment to require proof that the AKS violation actually caused the government to pay claims it otherwise would not have paid.",
          "Regeneron also notes that the 2010 amendment establishes an additional, distinct pathway to FCA liability separate from the pre-existing false-certification theory. Under false-certification, FCA liability can attach where a defendant misrepresents compliance with the AKS and that misrepresentation is material to payment; under the 2010 amendment, there is no need for any representation of compliance, but there is a causation element. Regeneron argues that it is appropriate that this alternative per se falsity route includes a but-for causation requirement, and that nothing in the statute\u2019s history or structure suggests Congress sought to create a broader, no-causation-required basis for FCA liability.",
          "Applying its interpretation to the underlying facts, Regeneron asserts that the government must prove that the alleged unlawful donations to CDF were a but-for cause of the prescriptions and resulting Medicare claims for Eylea. Regeneron maintains that if physicians would have prescribed Eylea and submitted the same Medicare claims even in the absence of any Regeneron-funded co-pay assistance, those claims cannot be considered to 'result from' an AKS violation within the meaning of the 2010 amendment."

          "reasoning":"The causation question turns on the meaning of the phrase \u201cresulting from\u201d in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a\u20117b(g), a pure issue of statutory interpretation reviewed de novo. The district court adopted a but\u2011for causation requirement based on Burrage\/Paroline and followed the Sixth and Eighth Circuits. On de novo review, however, the better reading in context is that Congress did not intend strict but\u2011for causation.\n\nTextually, \u201cresulting from\u201d ordinarily signals actual causation, but Supreme Court cases make clear that this default can be displaced where statutory context and purpose indicate otherwise. Here, the 2010 amendment was enacted specifically to strengthen AKS\u2011based FCA enforcement, against a backdrop of pre\u2011amendment cases that permitted FCA liability on AKS violations without requiring proof of but\u2011for causation of individual claims. The amendment\u2019s structure\u2014tying per se falsity to claims that include items or services \u201cresulting from\u201d an AKS violation\u2014was meant to close gaps like Thomas v. Bailey, i.e., to ensure that claims submitted by entities downstream from the kickback payor could still be false without an express false certification by the submitter, not to narrow the then\u2011existing causation regime.\n\nReading \u201cresulting from\u201d to require but\u2011for causation would make FCA liability turn on highly individualized proof of why particular doctors prescribed particular drugs, undermining the evident purpose of the amendment and making it more demanding than the AKS criminal provision itself, which does not require proof that a particular payment actually changed a prescribing decision. The government\u2019s proposed exposure\u2011plus\u2011claim nexus\u2014requiring that the claim be for items or services furnished to a patient who was exposed to the illegal remuneration tied to that product or referral\u2014retains a real causal connection while avoiding the practical nullification of the 2010 amendment. In light of the statute\u2019s text, the pre\u2011existing FCA doctrine Congress built upon, and the enforcement\u2011strengthening purpose reflected in the legislative history, the appellate court is likely to reject a strict but\u2011for causation requirement and adopt a looser causal nexus rather than the district court\u2019s rule."

      "reasoning":"This interlocutory appeal presents a single, purely legal question about the causation standard under the AKS\u2019s 2010 amendment. Although Burrage and similar cases create a strong linguistic presumption that \u201cresults from\u201d denotes but\u2011for causation, that presumption is not irrebuttable and must be evaluated in the statute\u2019s context. Here the context is distinctive: Congress acted in 2010 to solidify and extend AKS\u2011based FCA liability in response to case law requiring false certification by the claim submitter. The amendment\u2019s language and history suggest Congress intended to make it easier\u2014not harder\u2014 to reach claims tainted by kickbacks, including claims submitted by parties other than the kickback payor. Imposing a but\u2011for requirement would significantly weaken that mechanism by creating a demanding, physician\u2011specific causation proof that was not part of the pre\u20112010 landscape that Congress was codifying and extending.\n\nThe government\u2019s position that a claim is per se false if it is for services furnished to a patient exposed to the illegal remuneration creates a meaningful, though non\u2011but\u2011for, causal nexus that fits both the AKS\u2019s focus on corrupting influence and the amendment\u2019s objective to tie such influence to FCA liability. This reading also preserves the distinct roles of the amendment (per se falsity tied to causation) and traditional false\u2011certification theories without reading the causation phrase out of the statute. Balancing the textual presumption with the strong contextual signals, and in light of the explicit inter\u2011circuit disagreement that prompted certification, the more likely appellate outcome is to reject the strict but\u2011for standard adopted by the district court and remand under a more relaxed, exposure\u2011plus\u2011claim causal framework\u2014thus reversing the district court\u2019s legal ruling on the causation standard while leaving intact its determination that the government had adduced sufficient evidence to reach trial under the proper standard."

      "factual_background":"Pamela (Pam) Edwards owned and operated a beauty salon in Starkville, Mississippi, called Allure Salon. In 2007, she purchased a life insurance policy from Guardian Life Insurance of America. According to the record, she obtained the policy because she wanted to be sure she had something to leave to her husband, Jimmy Edwards. Pam handled all of Allure\u2019s financial matters, and Jimmy was unaware of the existence of the Guardian policy until after her death.\n\nPam was diagnosed with cancer in 2019 and thereafter underwent radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. Her cancer never went into remission, and she died on May 27, 2022. After her death, insurance agent Debbie Jaudon informed Jimmy that Pam had a Guardian life insurance policy. Jaudon then requested a life claim form from Guardian so that Jimmy could claim benefits.\n\nGuardian responded that the policy had been cancelled before Pam\u2019s death. Guardian characterized the coverage as a group policy issued to Allure Salon to cover multiple Allure employees. Guardian asserted that in November 2019 the number of covered participants under the policy dropped to one\u2014Pam\u2014triggering a contractual right under the policy allowing Guardian to cancel coverage when fewer than two employees are insured. Guardian maintained that it later exercised this right and cancelled Pam\u2019s coverage effective January 15, 2022. Guardian acknowledged that in September 2020 it had temporarily suspended its practice of terminating plans that had dropped to one participant, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that it later resumed normal cancellation practices. There is a 10\u2011month period between November 1, 2019 (when Pam allegedly became the sole covered employee) and September 2020 (when Guardian began its temporary suspension policy). Guardian accepted premiums for 26 months after the date it claims its cancellation right first vested. It remained unexplained in the record why Guardian never sent a notice of cancellation to Jaudon, Pam\u2019s insurance agent.\n\nThe record reflects that Allure had salon technicians working at the salon. Pam owned the salon building and equipment, controlled the salon hours, and received gross receipts from clients into the Allure business account. From that account, she paid the technicians. Allure paid the insurance premiums for the coverage, and these premium payments provided Allure with favorable tax treatment. The technicians\u2019 work was part of Allure\u2019s regular business of operating a salon.\n\nJimmy Edwards later passed away during the pendency of the appellate proceedings. His son, James R. Edwards, as executor of Jimmy\u2019s estate, was substituted as appellant.",

This conduct, under Fifth Circuit precedent, constitutes a waiver of the right to cancel.

Although Guardian continued to accept premiums after its cancellation right allegedly vested in November 2019 and instituted a COVID\u2011related moratorium in September 2020, there is no clear indication that Guardian intentionally relinquished the contractual right itself, as opposed to temporarily delaying its exercise as part of a general, pandemic\u2011driven policy. The unexplained delay and continued premium collection create an equitable concern but do not compel a finding, as a matter of law, that Guardian waived its right to terminate coverage before Pam\u2019s death. Under deferential review, the cancellation date and denial of benefits fall within the range of reasonable interpretations of the plan and Guardian\u2019s rights under it.

On the undisputed facts, Allure\u2019s technicians appear to be common\u2011law employees under the Darden factors: Pam supplied the place of work and equipment, controlled the salon\u2019s operations and hours, paid workers from the business account, and provided insurance premiums with favorable tax treatment. Those facts comfortably support the district court\u2019s conclusion that an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan existed. Because ERISA avoids coverage when only a sole owner (and spouse) is insured, appellant\u2019s exclusion argument is comparatively weaker. Given de novo review and the Fifth Circuit\u2019s general approach in similar small\u2011business ERISA cases, affirmance on issue 1 is likely.\n\nOnce ERISA applies, the dispute over Guardian\u2019s cancellation and alleged waiver is governed by ERISA standards and the plan language. Guardian expressly reserved a right to cancel when participation fell below two, and it ultimately set a cancellation effective date before Pam\u2019s death. While Guardian accepted premiums long after its right arguably vested and maintained a COVID\u2011related suspension of cancellations, those facts do not necessarily establish, as a matter of law, that Guardian waived the right to terminate. Waiver in this context requires clear evidence that the insurer intentionally relinquished a known contractual right; mere delay in exercising it, especially under a generalized, temporary moratorium, is typically insufficient. On abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion review, that record supports upholding Guardian\u2019s termination decision. The panel therefore has no strong basis to disturb the district court\u2019s partial summary judgment, making overall affirmance the most probable outcome."

The federal charges arose from an incident that also led to subsequent Commonwealth charges.\n\nIn February 2002, many months after the federal indictment, N\u00fa\u00f1ez was indicted in Puerto Rico superior court under Puerto Rico law for offenses arising from the same alleged incident. The Puerto Rico indictment charged him with carjacking, first-degree murder, and two weapons possession counts under Puerto Rico law.\n\nOn May 2, 2002, N\u00fa\u00f1ez pleaded guilty to the federal carjacking charge. Shortly thereafter, he was sentenced in federal court to ten years' imprisonment for that conviction, and the federal firearms counts were dismissed.\n\nOn November 14, 2003, after a jury trial in Puerto Rico superior court, N\u00fa\u00f1ez was found guilty of Puerto Rico carjacking and weapons charges and of the lesser-included Puerto Rico offense of manslaughter (rather than first-degree murder). He received a 69-year Puerto Rico prison sentence for those convictions, to be served consecutively to his ten-year federal sentence.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez appealed his Puerto Rico convictions, raising various issues and specifically challenging the constitutionality of his Puerto Rico sentence on the ground that he was already serving a federal sentence for the same conduct. The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals treated this as a Double Jeopardy Clause claim and rejected it, reasoning that Puerto Rico and the federal government were separate sovereigns and therefore both could independently punish the same conduct. N\u00fa\u00f1ez then sought certiorari from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, which was denied on February 2, 2007.\n\nOn June 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle, 579 U.S. 59, holding that the United States and Puerto Rico are not separate sovereigns for Double Jeopardy purposes and that neither may successively prosecute a single defendant for the same criminal conduct.\n\nOne year and eleven days after S\u00e1nchez Valle was decided, N\u00fa\u00f1ez filed a postconviction motion in Puerto Rico court under Rule 192.1 of the Puerto Rico Rules of Criminal Procedure, seeking collateral relief from his Puerto Rico carjacking and manslaughter convictions on the ground that, under S\u00e1nchez Valle, those convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause given his prior federal carjacking conviction based on the same conduct.",

S\u00e1nchez Valle, he filed a Puerto Rico Rule 192.1 postconviction motion arguing that the rule announced in S\u00e1nchez Valle barred his Puerto Rico carjacking and manslaughter convictions under the Double Jeopardy Clause because they arose from the same conduct as his prior federal carjacking conviction.\n\nAfter denial of his Rule 192.1 motion and subsequent certiorari petitions, N\u00fa\u00f1ez filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.

The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico also denied two motions for reconsideration.\n\nIn the subsequent federal habeas proceeding, after the respondents moved to dismiss, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico addressed the statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), requested supplemental briefing, held a hearing on November 4, 2021, and later ordered the respondents to file an answer pursuant to Habeas Rule 5.

The district court determined that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) provided the limitations trigger date because it found S\u00e1nchez Valle to be a new constitutional rule that applied retroactively, and it further concluded that equitable tolling rendered the petition timely despite an eleven-day delay relative to that one-year period. The district court also reached and resolved the merits of the Double Jeopardy\/S\u00e1nchez Valle claim in N\u00fa\u00f1ez's favor and ordered habeas relief.

They maintain that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), which measures from the date the state-court judgment became final, supplies the pertinent limitations trigger because the Supreme Court in S\u00e1nchez Valle did not expressly state that its ruling applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. Therefore, in their view, \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C), which depends on a newly recognized and retroactive right, does not apply. Under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), they calculate that the limitations period began when the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico denied certiorari on February 2, 2007, and expired one year later, on February 2, 2008. As the federal habeas petition was not filed until 2019, they contend it is untimely by more than a decade.",
          "They also argue that the alternative triggering provisions of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) and (D) are inapplicable because N\u00fa\u00f1ez neither alleged an unconstitutional state-created impediment to filing nor grounded his claim in newly discovered facts that could not earlier have been discovered with due diligence.",
          "In later district court proceedings, when the court raised \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) sua sponte, the respondents asserted that even if \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) were applicable, the petition would still be untimely. They pointed out that S\u00e1nchez Valle was decided on June 9, 2016, and that N\u00fa\u00f1ez filed his Puerto Rico Rule 192.1 motion more than a year after that date, so that the federal limitations period under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) expired before any tolling could occur under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). They contended that because the Rule 192.1 motion was filed after the one-year period had already expired, it could not toll or revive the limitations period, and thus the later federal habeas petition was out of time.",
          "They maintained that N\u00fa\u00f1ez had not initially alleged any basis for equitable tolling and that, on the record, no equitable tolling should be applied to excuse the eleven-day delay under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C).",
          "On appeal, respondents focus solely on the argument that the district court erred in treating the petition as timely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C), including its equitable tolling analysis, and they assert that they raised the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) timeliness issue sufficiently in the district court to preserve it (pointing to their statement at the motion-to-dismiss hearing, their allegation in the answer about the number of days between S\u00e1nchez Valle and the Rule 192.1 filing, and their later briefing after the court\u2019s sua sponte order). They also argue that, even if their omission was a forfeiture, the district court could properly revive and address the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) limitations issue when it raised it sua sponte."

S\u00e1nchez Valle\u2014that Puerto Rico and the United States are a single sovereign for Double Jeopardy purposes\u2014is a new rule of constitutional law that applies retroactively to his case on collateral review. He contends that, because he was prosecuted and convicted in Puerto Rico for carjacking and manslaughter based on the same conduct as his earlier federal carjacking conviction, his Puerto Rico convictions violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, and federal habeas relief is warranted.",
          "Regarding timeliness under AEDPA, N\u00fa\u00f1ez maintains in the district court that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) is the appropriate trigger because his claim is based on a right newly recognized by the Supreme Court in S\u00e1nchez Valle and made retroactively applicable. Under that framework, he calculates the one-year period from the date S\u00e1nchez Valle was issued (June 9, 2016) and argues that his pursuit of a Rule 192.1 motion in Puerto Rico court should toll the federal limitations period under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). When confronted with the fact that his Rule 192.1 motion was filed eleven days late relative to the one-year window, he invokes equitable tolling under Holland v. Florida, asserting that he diligently pursued his double jeopardy rights and that the statute of limitations is not an inflexible bar to his claim given the brief delay and the severity of the consequences (a lengthy, effectively life-term sentence).",
          "On appeal, beyond defending the district court\u2019s equitable tolling analysis, N\u00fa\u00f1ez argues that the respondents waived, rather than merely forfeited, any limitations defense based on \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C). He points to the fact that in their motion to dismiss and in their answer, the respondents consistently framed their statute-of-limitations defense only under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), taking the position that S\u00e1nchez Valle did not trigger \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C). He emphasizes that, although the respondents knew the dates of the S\u00e1nchez Valle decision and his Rule 192.1 filing and discussed \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) in arguing it did not apply, they did not plead or develop an affirmative defense that the petition was untimely even if \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) governed.",
          "He further contends that the respondents chose an \"all-or-nothing\" strategy below that turned on denying retroactivity to S\u00e1nchez Valle and that, even after the district court raised the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) issue sua sponte, the respondents did not explain or seek to correct their earlier omission as a mistake or inadvertence. He cites the standards in Day and Wood for distinguishing waiver from forfeiture and asserts that respondents made a knowing, strategic decision not to rely on an eleven-day-lateness defense under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C). On that basis, he argues that the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) argument cannot be used on appeal as a ground to overturn the grant of habeas relief."

On appeal, respondents press only the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) timeliness issue, but that argument depends on the premise that the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) defense was properly in the case. As explained under Issue 2, the Commonwealth\u2019s litigation choices below amounted to a waiver\u2014not just forfeiture\u2014of any timeliness defense premised on \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C). Under Wood v. Milyard, once the State has intentionally relinquished a known statute\u2011of\u2011limitations defense, the federal courts may not resurrect it sua sponte or on appeal. Because that defense was waived, the appellate court will not reach the merits of whether the petition was eleven days late or whether equitable tolling was correctly applied. With the only preserved limitations theory (\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A)) plainly inapplicable if S\u00e1nchez Valle is treated as retroactive, there is no basis to disturb the district court\u2019s conclusion that the petition is timely.

          "reasoning":"Whether the State preserved, forfeited, or waived a statute\u2011of\u2011limitations defense is a legal question reviewed de novo, guided by Day v. McDonough and Wood v.

In the district court, respondents consistently advanced only an \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) theory: that the one\u2011year clock began when the Puerto Rico judgment became final in 2007 and expired in 2008. They argued that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) never came into play because, in their view, S\u00e1nchez Valle was not retroactive; they did not plead or develop the alternative contention that, even if \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) applied, the petition was time\u2011barred because the Rule 192.1 filing came eleven days after the one\u2011year period had run. That is, they chose an all\u2011or\u2011nothing strategy: either \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) did not apply at all (their position), or, if it did, they did not seek to rely on the narrow eleven\u2011day lateness as a fallback defense. The record shows knowledge of all relevant dates and of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C), coupled with a deliberate decision not to assert timeliness under that subsection. Under Wood, that is waiver\u2014an intentional relinquishment of a known limitations defense\u2014not inadvertent forfeiture. Because a waived limitations defense cannot be revived by the court sua sponte or asserted on appeal, the appellate court will hold that the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) timeliness argument is unavailable to respondents. This leaves intact the district court\u2019s judgment granting habeas relief."

They do not contest the underlying double\u2011jeopardy\/S\u00e1nchez Valle merits ruling. The controlling habeas timeliness precedents (Day and Wood) make the dispositive question whether the State preserved, merely forfeited, or affirmatively waived the \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C) limitations defense. The summary indicates that respondents knew the critical dates and \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C)\u2019s framework but pursued a conscious strategy of denying retroactivity altogether, rather than arguing both retroactivity and untimeliness as alternative defenses. That pattern closely resembles the knowing waiver discussed in Wood, not a simple pleading lapse. Once characterized as waiver, courts may not resurrect the defense, so the eleven\u2011day discrepancy and equitable tolling analysis are effectively moot on appeal. With the only properly preserved limitations theory (\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A)) rejected by the district court and not meaningfully re\u2011argued as an alternative basis for reversal here, the grant of habeas relief stands.

      "factual_background":"In August 2016, Mitchell Marks, the principal of Little Hearts Marks Family II L.P., signed a contract to purchase a 65,000 square foot warehouse located at 305 East 61st Street in Manhattan for $40,000,000. Marks organized a group of real estate investors to finance the purchase and to convert the building into a condominium through a limited liability company, 305 East 61st Street Group LLC. The LLC had four members: 61 Prime LLC (Prime) with a 50% interest; Little Hearts with a 30% interest; Onestone 305, LLC with a 10% interest; and an individual investor, Thaddeus Pollock, with a 10% interest.\n\nThe purchase was financed by a $20,000,000 acquisition loan from Banco Popular North America and capital investments from the members totaling $21,328,000. Construction work was to be financed by an additional $10,000,000 construction loan from Banco Popular. The acquisition and construction loans were secured by a single $30,000,000 mortgage on the building in favor of Banco Popular and were guaranteed by Little Hearts, Prime, Marks, and Carter. Little Hearts, Onestone, and Pollock each assumed responsibility for $3,750,000 (one\u2010eighth of the total indebtedness), and Prime assumed responsibility for the remaining $18,750,000 (five\u2010eighths).\n\nThe members executed an Operating Agreement to govern the LLC. Little Hearts was initially designated as the manager. If Little Hearts resigned or was removed as manager, Prime had the contractual right to assume the duties of manager or designate a replacement manager. The Operating Agreement allocated specific floors of the building to particular members for interior work and economic benefit. Little Hearts received the contractual right to retain, use, occupy, develop, and acquire condominium units consisting of the basement\/cellar and first floor, and the tenth floor and roof. Prime was assigned the fourth through seventh floors and the ninth floor. Onestone and Pollock also had designated floors, but their rights were more limited; they obtained options to acquire units on their floors but not the right to share in sale or lease proceeds. A later amendment gave Little Hearts the right to the second floor as well.\n\nUnder the Operating Agreement, Little Hearts and Prime had rights with respect to their designated units to perform alterations, sell all or part, and lease, sublease, assign, and use the units without consent of the company or, after condominium formation, the condominium board. Once a condominium plan was approved, Little Hearts and Prime could either acquire their designated units or market them and share in the proceeds. Sales proceeds were to be applied first to pay off the Banco Popular loans, then closing expenses, then sums due under the agreement, with any remaining proceeds remitted to the selling member. Little Hearts also had additional rights in certain units referred to as the \u201cMarks Units\u201d (including the cellar and first floor). At closing, the LLC, as landlord, entered into a lease with Little Hearts, as tenant, for the cellar and first floor. A lease rider gave Little Hearts the right to sublease those floors without the company\u2019s consent and to install signs, lights, advertisements, or notices on the exterior of the building. Little Hearts also had the right, with Prime\u2019s consent, to make alterations to the roof, financed by company capital, and the right to subdivide the tenth floor into two units without company consent.\n\nLittle Hearts alleges that it relied on these contractual rights and invested millions of dollars renovating the Marks Units for its own use, or for lease or sale. It entered into a 15-year sublease for the ground floor unit with non-party Acqua Ancien Bath New York, Inc. (referred to as the \u201cSpa\u201d), acting as sub-landlord.\n\nIn spring 2018, Prime allegedly refused to pay $62,500 of its capital subscription to the company, prompting the LLC to sue Prime in New York state court. Prime and Carter then brought a separate state action seeking to remove Little Hearts as manager and moved ex parte for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which Little Hearts characterizes as having been obtained based on grossly false allegations. The state court granted the TRO and installed Prime as manager.\n\nLittle Hearts alleges that, after Prime took over as manager, Prime and Carter mismanaged the company: over the next two years, they allegedly did not advance construction work, did not renew permits, did not advance the condominium offering plan, and did not correct a stop-work order issued by the City of New York for purportedly illegal work initiated by defendants. Little Hearts further alleges that Prime and Carter interfered with the Spa sublease by cutting power and water to the ground floor unit, locking the Spa out of the unit in violation of a court order, violating an August 23, 2018 TRO and order directing them to restore utilities, and thereby causing the Spa to sue the company for substantial damages.\n\nThe Banco Popular loans matured in December 2018. Prime allegedly failed to pay its 5\/8 share of the mortgage debt. According to the complaint, instead of arranging commercially reasonable refinancing, Carter tried to refinance the mortgage on commercially unreasonable terms from a personal friend, while rejecting several refinancing proposals from Little Hearts that Little Hearts contends were on commercially reasonable terms. Little Hearts alleges that Carter attempted to pressure Marks to accept his refinancing proposal and stated that \u201cthere is only going to be one winner here, and it\u2019s not going to be you\u2014give in while there is something still left in it for you,\u201d and that Carter did not want the mortgage paid because he intended to acquire the building.\n\nAfter the LLC defaulted, the entity holding the loans began foreclosure proceedings. In the state action in which Prime sought to keep Little Hearts removed as manager, Prime moved for a preliminary injunction. The state court held a hearing in February 2019 and, by May 2019, indicated that Prime was not entitled to a preliminary injunction and that Little Hearts was entitled to have a receiver appointed. Before the state court resolved the preliminary-injunction request, on June 10, 2019, Prime, acting as manager, caused the LLC to file a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the Southern District of New York. Little Hearts alleges the bankruptcy was unnecessary because the LLC was solvent and the building\u2019s value exceeded the company\u2019s liabilities, and that Prime initiated the case solely to avoid an adverse ruling in the state litigation.\n\nOn the same day the company filed for bankruptcy, Carter formed Lazarus 5, LLC. The complaint alleges Lazarus 5 was created for the purpose of purchasing the mortgage and then forcing a sale of the building to itself. A bankruptcy trustee was appointed and, in May 2020, proposed a plan of liquidation. The plan contemplated the sale of the building to Lazarus 5 and created a creditor trust whose sole purpose was to liquidate the remaining assets of the bankruptcy estate, including legal claims, and distribute the proceeds to creditors. The plan permanently enjoined actions involving property of the estate, including legal claims that belonged to the estate, unless brought by the creditor trustee. At a bankruptcy sale on August 12, 2020, Lazarus 5 purchased the mortgage and acquired the building for approximately $50,000,000.\n\nLittle Hearts alleges that Prime and Carter used their control of the LLC and the bankruptcy process to squeeze out Little Hearts and to transfer the building to themselves (through Lazarus 5), thereby depriving Little Hearts of its capital investment and its contractual rights in the Marks Units.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In June 2019, after the bankruptcy filing, Little Hearts commenced an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court. Little Hearts, Carter, and the creditor trustee participated in mediation, which was unsuccessful. Little Hearts then filed a separate lawsuit in New York state court against Prime and Carter. The defendants removed that action to the bankruptcy court under Bankruptcy Rule 9027(a)(3).\n\nIn the removed complaint, Little Hearts asserted six causes of action: (1) breach of fiduciary duty (Count I); (2) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty (Count II); (3) breach of contract (Count III); (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count IV); (5) an alter ego theory against Carter, styled as a separate cause of action (Count V); and (6) unjust enrichment (Count VI). The gravamen of the complaint was that Prime and Carter, using their control of the LLC and the bankruptcy process, squeezed out Little Hearts and transferred the building to themselves. Little Hearts sought at least $48,052,000 in damages, representing lost capital investment and the loss of rights under the Operating Agreement, including its rights to retain, use, occupy, and develop the Marks Units.",
        "district_court_decision":"The bankruptcy court dismissed the complaint in its entirety. It concluded that the claims asserted by Little Hearts were derivative of injuries to the debtor LLC rather than direct injuries to Little Hearts and therefore belonged to the debtor and, under the confirmed plan and creditor trust agreement, had vested in the creditor trust. The bankruptcy court held that the Marks Units did not constitute distinct property or contract rights separate from Little Hearts\u2019 membership interest in the debtor; rather, the assignment of specific units reflected the members\u2019 respective equity interests in the LLC. On that basis, the court determined that all of Little Hearts\u2019 causes of action were derivative claims that only the estate (through the creditor trustee) could assert. The district court for the Southern District of New York affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment dismissing the complaint.",

It maintains that these unit-specific rights are distinct from its equity interest in the LLC and thus are not merely reflections of its membership share.",
          "It argues that the bankruptcy and district courts incorrectly characterized all of its claims as derivative of injuries to the LLC, ignoring the fact that the Operating Agreement and lease granted Little Hearts unique, individual rights (e.g., to sublease the Marks Units without company consent, to install signs, to subdivide units) that no other member possessed. Little Hearts asserts that the alleged misconduct directly destroyed or impaired these personal contractual rights.",
          "With respect to the fiduciary-duty-based counts, Little Hearts argues that Prime and Carter owed fiduciary duties not only to the LLC but also directly to Little Hearts as a member and manager, including duties arising from the Operating Agreement provisions that required the manager to devote reasonable time to managing the company\u2019s business and to act in good faith and with due care. It maintains that the challenged conduct\u2014including mismanagement, initiating what it characterizes as an unnecessary bankruptcy to block state-court relief, and engineering a sale of the building to Lazarus 5\u2014directly harmed Little Hearts in ways not shared equally by all members because of its specific contractual interests in the Marks Units.",

It points to actions such as cutting off utilities, locking out the Spa, and violating court orders, which allegedly induced the Spa to sue the company and undermined Little Hearts\u2019 sublease value.",
          "It asserts that its unjust enrichment claim is premised on Prime and Carter\u2019s allegedly wrongful acquisition, through Lazarus 5, of the building and the economic benefits associated with the Marks Units, arguing that they were enriched at Little Hearts\u2019 expense by appropriating property and contract-derived opportunities that rightfully belonged to Little Hearts.",
          "On the jurisdictional question raised at oral argument, Little Hearts contends that the bankruptcy court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over its remaining direct, state-law claims because they are insufficiently connected to the administration of the bankruptcy estate to qualify as core or related proceedings under \u00a7 1334(b). It further suggests that even if some related jurisdiction exists, the standards for abstention under \u00a7 1334(c)(2) are satisfied and the matter should proceed in state court."

          "They contend that the Marks Units do not constitute separate property interests or contract rights independent of Little Hearts\u2019 membership interest. According to their view, the allocation of particular floors among members was simply an internal arrangement reflecting each member\u2019s equity share in the LLC, rather than a grant of independent, enforceable rights that survive or exist apart from the member\u2019s general investment.

They argue that under the Tooley framework (as applied by New York courts), these fiduciary-duty claims are necessarily derivative because Little Hearts cannot prevail without showing injury to the LLC.",

The allegations about mismanagement, filing bankruptcy to avoid an adverse state\u2011court ruling, and engineering a low\u2011control sale of the building concern injuries to the LLC as an operating entity (loss of the building, foreclosure risk, value diminution). Those fiduciary\u2011duty theories are classic derivative injuries that any member would share and that require proof of injury to the LLC, so dismissal as estate\/creditor\u2011trust claims is affirmed as to those aspects. But the complaint also describes conduct that targeted Little Hearts\u2019 unique, contract-based position: cutting utilities to the Spa, locking out the Spa in violation of court orders (thereby destroying the value of Little Hearts\u2019 sublease and related leasehold expectations), and using control of the bankruptcy and sale process specifically to strip Little Hearts of its bargained\u2011for rights in the Marks Units (exclusive rights to retain, occupy, develop, lease, and sublease specified floors, and to install signage, subdivide, and alter the roof). Those are injuries not shared pro rata by all members and trace to duties arguably owed directly to Little Hearts as counterparty to the Operating Agreement and related lease, not only to the LLC. Little Hearts could, in principle, prevail on those narrow theories by showing direct interference with or usurpation of its unit\u2011specific rights, without proving a net injury to the entity. Under New York law informed by Delaware\u2019s Tooley line, those are direct fiduciary\u2011duty claims. The lower courts treated all fiduciary\u2011duty theories as derivative and belonging solely to the estate; that global characterization is overbroad. The appellate court is likely to affirm the dismissal of the mismanagement\/overall value\u2011loss fiduciary claims as derivative, but reverse insofar as the courts barred Little Hearts from pursuing fiduciary\u2011duty theories predicated on the destruction or misappropriation of its distinct Marks\u2011Unit and Spa\u2011sublease rights."

Under New York law (and Delaware precedents like NAF Holdings), when a plaintiff sues to enforce its own contract rights, the derivative\/direct Tooley test does not bar a direct action simply because the alleged breach also harmed the entity. Here, the Operating Agreement and lease gave Little Hearts specific, personal rights: to retain, use, occupy, lease, and develop identified units (cellar, first floor, second floor, tenth floor, roof), to sublease without company consent, to install exterior signage, and to subdivide the tenth floor. The complaint alleges that Prime and Carter\u2019s conduct, including the way they used the bankruptcy and sale to Lazarus 5, directly destroyed those individual rights and made performance of the Spa sublease impossible. Those claims seek to vindicate Little Hearts\u2019 own commercial contract rights, not the LLC\u2019s. Under NAF Holdings, such contract and implied\u2011covenant claims are direct even if the same conduct also injured the company. The bankruptcy and district courts effectively collapsed those contract interests into Little Hearts\u2019 equity stake and held the claims derivative; that misapplies the direct\u2011contract\u2011right doctrine. The appellate court is therefore likely to hold that the contract and implied\u2011covenant claims are direct and do not belong to the estate or creditor trust, and to reverse the dismissal on that basis."

But once those surviving claims are characterized as direct state\u2011law claims between non\u2011diverse parties that could not have been brought in federal court absent \u00a7 1334(b), they are non\u2011core, related proceedings.

The record shows these claims were originally filed in state court and removed under the bankruptcy rules; there is no finding by the lower courts applying the Parmalat timeliness standard or expressly analyzing \u00a7 1334(c)(2) after narrowing the case to surviving direct claims. Because the jurisdictional issue only sharpened once the claims are properly re\u2011classified as direct, the appellate court will likely hold that the bankruptcy court did have related, non\u2011core jurisdiction to entertain the removed action, but remand for the bankruptcy (or district) court to determine in the first instance whether mandatory abstention applies and, if not, whether permissive abstention or equitable remand is appropriate."

The facts and pleadings strongly support that Little Hearts possessed unique unit\u2011specific rights under the Operating Agreement and lease and that some alleged misconduct\u2014especially the interference with the Spa sublease and the squeezing out of those Marks\u2011Unit rights through the bankruptcy sale\u2014injured Little Hearts in a way not shared equally by all members. Under NAF Holdings and related cases, Little Hearts may bring direct contract and implied\u2011covenant claims on those rights. By contrast, the unjust\u2011enrichment theory simply repackages the contract\u2011right injury and is almost certainly dismissed as duplicative under Corsello and NetJets. On jurisdiction, once the surviving claims are accepted as direct state\u2011law claims between non\u2011diverse parties, they are best viewed as non\u2011core but at least \u201crelated to\u201d the Chapter 11 case, supporting \u00a7 1334(b) jurisdiction but triggering a serious question of mandatory abstention, which the lower courts did not fully resolve in that posture. The likely appellate remedy is to affirm jurisdiction in principle, but remand for a proper \u00a7 1334(c)(2) analysis. The combined result is mixed: some fiduciary\u2011duty theories and all contract\/implied\u2011covenant claims are reinstated as direct claims; unjust enrichment remains dismissed; jurisdiction is recognized but abstention is left for the lower court to address on remand."

The partner obtained this group health coverage through the partner's employer, and the policy was an employee benefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Blaise suffered from asthma. On March 18, 2020, Blaise, through his physician, sought coverage under the BCBS policy for a Wixela Inhub inhaler as treatment for his asthma. On March 25, 2020, BCBS denied coverage for the Wixela Inhub. In its written denial, BCBS stated that its Pharmacy Operations Unit had reviewed the material submitted by Blaise's doctor and that coverage for Wixela Inhub, requested for the treatment of asthma, could not be approved because there was no documentation that Blaise had tried one prescription inhaled steroid, inhaled beta-agonist, inhaled mast cell stabilizer, oral albuterol, or theophylline product within the prior 130 days, and there was also no documentation of Blaise having tried two of the following medications: Dulera (which required prior authorization), Symbicort (which required prior authorization), and\/or fluticasone\/salmeterol (generic for Airduo, also requiring prior authorization). Blaise did not pursue or file any internal appeal of this denial of benefits through the BCBS plan procedures. Blaise later died from asthma-related complications.

On November 7, 2023, the court denied BCBS's motion to dismiss without prejudice to BCBS raising the ERISA preemption issue later in a motion for summary judgment.

Cannon conceded that ERISA preempted most of his state-law claims but argued that his wrongful death claim under Mass. Gen.

The court further concluded that the wrongful death claim functioned as an alternative enforcement mechanism for recovering damages related to an alleged breach of the ERISA plan and therefore conflicted with ERISA's civil enforcement scheme under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a).

He argues that the Massachusetts wrongful death statute is a generally applicable law governing wrongful death and is not directed at, or intended to regulate, insurance or employee benefit plans, and therefore should not be treated as a state law that \"relates to\" an ERISA plan within the meaning of \u00a7 1144(a).",

Fallon Community Health Plan, Inc., and decisions from other circuits, establish that wrongful death actions predicated on an insurer's denial of benefits under an ERISA plan are preempted.

Fallon, holds that wrongful death claims based on benefit denials under ERISA-governed plans are preempted because they effectively challenge plan administration and seek plan-related remedies. The Massachusetts statute may be generally applicable, but when applied here it functions as a vehicle to obtain state-law remedies for alleged mishandling of an ERISA benefits decision. Rutledge did not narrow the \u2018relates to\u2019 test in a way that would alter that analysis in the individual-benefits context. Under binding circuit law, the district court\u2019s conclusion that the wrongful death and associated punitive damages claims \u201crelate to\u201d the ERISA plan is likely to be affirmed."

          "reasoning":"Whether a state-law cause of action is completely\/expressly preempted because it falls within \u00a71132(a)\u2019s exclusive remedial scheme is a legal question reviewed de novo. Under Davila, a state-law claim is preempted if (1) the plaintiff could have brought a claim under \u00a71132(a)(1)(B) and (2) no independent legal duty is implicated. The substance of Cannon\u2019s claim is that BCBS wrongly denied coverage for medical treatment to a plan beneficiary, and that denial allegedly caused death. Blaise plainly could have brought a \u00a71132(a)(1)(B) action during his lifetime to challenge the denial and seek appropriate relief. Massachusetts wrongful death law is derivative, so the estate\u2019s right depends on what Blaise could have asserted. The wrongful death claim does not rest on any duty independent of the ERISA plan; the alleged wrongful act is the denial of a plan benefit, not some separate medical negligence or non-plan-based duty. The fact that Cannon himself is not a plan \u201cparticipant or beneficiary,\u201d and that the wrongful death cause of action arose only upon Blaise\u2019s death, does not satisfy Davila\u2019s \u201cindependent legal duty\u201d requirement where the underlying duty is entirely defined by the ERISA plan and ERISA governs who may enforce those duties. Consequently, the claim duplicates\/supplements the ERISA remedial scheme and is preempted. The district court\u2019s ruling on \u00a71132 preemption is likely to be affirmed."

Massachusetts law treats wrongful death actions as derivative of the decedent\u2019s own cause of action; beneficiaries recover only if the decedent would have had a viable claim, and defenses or limitations applicable to the decedent generally carry through. Here, Blaise\u2019s only possible claim against BCBS would have been for wrongful denial of ERISA plan benefits, which would have been constrained by ERISA\u2019s enforcement provisions, including preemption. Because the estate\u2019s wrongful death claim is derivative of Blaise\u2019s ERISA-governed rights and merely seeks a different measure of damages (death-related and punitive) for the same alleged wrongful denial of benefits, it falls within ERISA\u2019s preemptive scope.

Rutledge addressed a generally applicable state statute regulating PBM reimbursement rates, concluding that it did not impermissibly dictate plan choices or structures and did not refer specifically to ERISA plans, functioning instead as cost regulation. The decision reaffirmed the \u2018connection with or reference to\u2019 framework and distinguished prior cases on their facts; it did not purport to overrule Davila or cases like Turner that deal with individual benefit-denial suits. Cannon\u2019s claims are not abstract cost regulation; they are targeted at a specific denial of benefits and would impose state tort remedies directly on the process of determining and administering coverage under an ERISA plan. That is the core territory in which earlier preemption cases apply with full force. A lower court is not free to treat Turner and similar circuit precedent as implicitly overruled by Rutledge absent clear incompatibility, which is not present here. Thus, the appellate court will almost certainly hold that Rutledge does not save Cannon\u2019s wrongful death and punitive damages claims from preemption and will affirm the district court on this point."

Under Davila and longstanding First Circuit precedent (including Turner), wrongful death and similar state-law actions premised on improper benefit denials are both expressly preempted under \u00a71144(a) and precluded by ERISA\u2019s exclusive remedial scheme under \u00a71132(a). Massachusetts wrongful death law is derivative, further tying the estate\u2019s claim to whatever ERISA-limited rights Blaise had during his lifetime. Rutledge concerns a regulatory, generally applicable rate-setting statute and preserves the core principles of ERISA preemption; it does not undermine circuit authority on individual benefits litigation.

Vimeo operates an online video-sharing website where users can upload and share videos. Users uploaded videos to Vimeo that included, played, or synchronized copyright-protected music owned by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs contend that Vimeo encouraged users to create and post certain kinds of videos, including so-called 'lip\u2011dub' videos\u2014videos in which users mouth or perform along with popular songs\u2014using Plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted music without authorization. The record includes evidence that Vimeo curated its site, enforced content restrictions, monitored user content, and that Vimeo employees sometimes interacted with users about use of copyrighted music. There were instances in which Vimeo employees, contrary to company policy, responded to user inquiries about using copyrighted music by suggesting that such uses were allowed unless and until a copyright holder sent a takedown notice. One such exchange involved a user asking about copyrighted music usage in 'lip\u2011dub' videos and being told by a Vimeo employee that 'we allow it, however if the copyright holder sent us a legal takedown notice, we could have to comply.' Plaintiffs characterize Vimeo\u2019s conduct as including the creation, upload, and promotion of lip\u2011dub videos and a generalized effort to promote videos incorporating music, which they say encouraged or induced users to infringe Plaintiffs\u2019 copyrights. Vimeo characterizes any such instances as sporadic deviations from policy and disputes that its conduct amounted to inducement of infringement or to the kind of control that would disqualify it from the DMCA safe harbor.",

        "district_court_decision":"At summary judgment, the parties cross\u2011moved on DMCA safe harbor issues. Plaintiffs sought partial summary judgment rejecting Vimeo\u2019s \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor defense, arguing that Vimeo had actual or red\u2011flag knowledge and failed to act expeditiously, and that Vimeo had the 'right and ability to control' the infringing activity coupled with a direct financial benefit under \u00a7 512(c)(1)(B). Following the analytical framework identified in Viacom Int\u2019l, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc., the district court treated two distinct theories for 'right and ability to control' as 'analytical guideposts': (1) the 'Cybernet' path, where a service provider exerts substantial influence by imposing editorial standards and implementing a strict monitoring program (as in Perfect 10, Inc. v. Cybernet Ventures, Inc.), and (2) the 'Grokster' path, where a provider induces infringement through purposeful, culpable expression and conduct (as in Metro\u2011Goldwyn\u2011Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.). In a section titled 'Cybernet\u2014Substantial Influence Through a Monitoring Program,' the court analyzed Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence concerning Vimeo\u2019s curation, content restrictions, and monitoring program and concluded there was no triable issue that Vimeo exerted substantial influence on user activity through a Cybernet\u2011type monitoring program. In a subsequent section titled 'Grokster\u2014Substantial Influence through Inducement of Infringement,' the court analyzed Plaintiffs\u2019 inducement theory\u2014including the lip\u2011dub\u2011related evidence\u2014and concluded there was 'no basis to conclude that Vimeo exerted substantial influence on its users\u2019 activities through inducement.' The court recognized some 'stray instances of wrongful conduct by Vimeo employees' and a generalized effort to promote videos that incorporate music, but found this evidence did not rise to the level of the extensive inducement evidence present in Grokster. The district court thus rejected both the Cybernet\u2011based and Grokster\u2011based theories of 'right and ability to control' and found Vimeo eligible for the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor on that ground. Separately, the district court certified three issues for interlocutory appeal that concerned: (i) whether \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor applies to pre\u20111972 sound recordings; (ii) whether evidence of some viewing by Vimeo employees of videos that played all or virtually all of 'recognizable' copyrighted songs was sufficient to show red\u2011flag knowledge; and (iii) whether Plaintiffs had shown a general policy of willful blindness to infringement warranting imputation of knowledge of specific infringements.",
        "what_is_appealed":"In the earlier interlocutory appeal (Vimeo I), Plaintiffs appealed the three certified questions: the applicability of the \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor to pre\u20111972 sound recordings; whether employee viewing of videos with recognizable songs established red\u2011flag knowledge; and whether Vimeo had a general policy of willful blindness to infringement that would justify imputing knowledge of specific infringements. As part of their willful blindness argument on interlocutory appeal, Plaintiffs asserted that Vimeo 'actively encouraged users to post videos containing infringing material,' citing employee communications including those related to lip\u2011dub videos, and argued that a provider cannot encourage infringement and then avoid liability by claiming ignorance. The appellate court in that interlocutory proceeding rejected Plaintiffs\u2019 willful blindness theory, characterizing the cited instances as 'sporadic' and insufficient to show generalized encouragement of infringement or red\u2011flag knowledge, and did not address Grokster or inducement terminology in that context. After the case returned to the district court and final judgment issues were resolved, Plaintiffs pursued a direct appeal challenging, among other rulings, the district court\u2019s determination that Vimeo qualified for the DMCA safe harbor under \u00a7 512(c). On direct appeal, Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief challenged the district court\u2019s 'right and ability to control' ruling principally under a Cybernet\u2011based 'substantial influence through editorial control' theory. In that brief, Plaintiffs included Footnote 5 acknowledging that service providers can also exercise substantial influence by inducing infringement as in Grokster, but further stating that 'the rightsholders acknowledge that Vimeo I forecloses (at this stage) the argument that Vimeo\u2019s \"urging\" and \"encouraging users to post infringing material\" constituted inducement under Grokster,' and that they were merely 'preserv[ing]' that argument for further review. Vimeo\u2019s opposition brief asserted that, on appeal, Plaintiffs had limited their challenge to the district court\u2019s Cybernet analysis and had abandoned any Grokster\u2011based inducement theory; Plaintiffs did not contest that characterization in their reply. In a January 13, 2025 opinion on direct appeal, the Second Circuit treated Plaintiffs\u2019 Grokster\u2011based 'right and ability to control' argument (including the lip\u2011dub inducement theory) as waived or forfeited on appeal based on the manner in which Plaintiffs framed their brief, and included a footnote (Footnote 15) questioning whether Plaintiffs had properly preserved that Grokster\u2011based argument for potential Supreme Court review. Plaintiffs then filed the present petition for rehearing, asking the Second Circuit to reconsider its conclusion that they had waived the Grokster inducement theory and to remove the language in Footnote 15 concerning preservation of that argument for Supreme Court review. Vimeo opposed the petition."

He further alleged that these actions were taken in retaliation for his engaging in what he contended was protected activity: questioning defendants\u2019 access to and use of his private medical information. As part of his discrimination allegations, Tenemille asserted that there were numerous similarly situated white officers who submitted doctors\u2019 notes that he characterized as identical to his own, and that these officers\u2019 notes were accepted without legal challenge or investigation based on the wording of the notes.

A complaint survives dismissal if the facts alleged plausibly state a claim for relief. For a Title VII discrimination claim, a plaintiff must allege that the employer discriminated against the plaintiff because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Absent direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff must plausibly allege that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for his position, (3) he suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) he has at least minimal support for the proposition that the employer was motivated by discriminatory intent. For a \u00a7 1983 claim premised on equal protection, the plaintiff must allege a violation of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law; the equal protection analysis parallels Title VII, though \u00a7 1983 allows individual liability. An inference of discrimination based on comparators requires that the comparators be similarly situated to the plaintiff in all material respects and that there be a reasonably close resemblance in the facts and circumstances of the cases."

          "reasoning":"Reviewed de novo, the court will accept Tenemille\u2019s factual allegations but still require enough nonconclusory detail to make discrimination and retaliation plausible. His core theory is comparator-based: that white officers submitted \u2018identical\u2019 notes but were not disciplined. Appellate courts routinely hold that bare assertions of \u2018identical\u2019 or \u2018similar\u2019 treatment, without factual allegations about who the comparators are, their ranks, supervisors, timing, disciplinary history, or the actual content and context of their notes, are too conclusory to raise a plausible inference of discriminatory intent. The summary indicates his pleading lacked that level of detail and was dismissed as conclusory. The fact that there was an internal investigation into arguably questionable sick notes, standing alone, describes a facially legitimate disciplinary process and does not itself imply discrimination or retaliation absent specific facts tying the investigation or termination to his race\/national origin or alleged protected activity. His retaliation theory likewise lacks nonconclusory allegations linking the investigation and termination to his questioning of access to his medical information beyond temporal proximity and generalized assertions. Given Second Circuit pleading standards in employment cases and the district court\u2019s conclusion that only some allegations were timely and those failed plausibly to allege discriminatory or retaliatory animus, the appellate court is very likely to agree that the complaint, even liberally construed pro se, fails to state a claim under Title VII, \u00a7 1983, or parallel state law. The partial time-bar ruling is also unlikely to be disturbed because nothing in the summary suggests a viable argument that the limitations periods were misapplied or that equitable tolling should apply."

To prevail under Rule 60(b)(3), Tenemille had to show that specific fraudulent conduct by defendants prevented him from fully and fairly presenting his case. The summary reflects that his \u2018fraud\u2019 assertions rehashed the same underlying factual disputes about the investigation and termination that were already before the court in his complaint and opposition to dismissal. Appellate courts regularly hold that such arguments do not meet Rule 60(b)(3)\u2019s requirement of fraud affecting the integrity of the proceedings; they simply express disagreement with the merits ruling. The district court also gave him an opportunity to file a fifth amended complaint before entering final judgment, reinforcing that he had a full chance to present his claims. On this record, the appellate court is very likely to conclude that the district court acted well within its discretion in treating the filing as a Rule 60(b) motion and denying it for failure to show fraud or any other ground for extraordinary relief."

The complaint, as described, relies heavily on conclusory assertions of discriminatory and retaliatory motives and on inadequately detailed comparator allegations. Under de novo review, the appellate court will still apply Twombly\/Iqbal and its own precedents requiring some factual content to support an inference of bias; it will not rewrite the complaint to fix missing comparator detail. On the post-judgment motion, the abuse-of-discretion standard and the nature of Tenemille\u2019s Rule 60(b) arguments\u2014essentially a repetition of his underlying merits contentions framed as \u2018fraud\u2019\u2014make reversal particularly unlikely.

        "appellee":"Great Salt Bay Community School Board, municipal entity responsible for Great Salt Bay Community School; and Samuel Roy (school social worker), Kim Schaff (principal), Lynsey Johnston (district superintendent), and Jessica Berk (school social worker), all sued in their official capacities as school staff\/administrators"
      },
      "factual_background":"Great Salt Bay Community School (\"Great Salt\") is a K\u20138 school. Amber Lavigne\u2019s minor child, A.B., began attending Great Salt in 2019. Lavigne was initially generally pleased with A.B.\u2019s education. In December 2022, when A.B. was thirteen, Lavigne discovered a chest binder while cleaning A.B.\u2019s room. The complaint defines a chest binder as a device used to flatten a female's chest so as to appear male. A.B. told Lavigne that school social worker Samuel Roy had provided the chest binder and had instructed A.B. on its use. Lavigne further alleges that, the same day, Roy gave A.B. a second chest binder and told A.B. he was not going to tell A.B.\u2019s parents about the binders and that A.B. did not need to do so either. Lavigne alleges that she was never notified by the school that A.B. would be or had been given chest binders or instructed in their use.\n\nAround this same period, Lavigne learned that at school A.B. was using a name and pronouns different from those given at birth and used at home. According to the complaint, the school never informed her that A.B. was using an alternate name and pronouns at school. Lavigne alleges that the defendants \"withheld and concealed\" information about both the chest binders and A.B.'s use of a different name and pronouns pursuant to what she characterizes as a \"blanket policy, pattern, and practice\" of withholding and concealing information from parents about so-called \"gender-affirming\" treatment of minor children. She further alleges there is no policy or procedure allowing parents to provide input when a student chooses to use a different name and pronouns at school.\n\nShortly after discovering the chest binder, Lavigne met with Principal Kim Schaff and Superintendent Lynsey Johnston. According to the complaint, both expressed sympathy and concern that the information had been withheld and concealed from her. Two days later, Superintendent Johnston told Lavigne that no policy had been violated by giving chest binders to A.B. or by school officials\u2019 use of an alternate name and pronouns for A.B. Soon thereafter, Lavigne withdrew A.B. from Great Salt, citing what she viewed as the school\u2019s policy, pattern, and practice of withholding and concealing important information about her minor child\u2019s psychosexual development.\n\nLavigne alleges that school officials pointed her to certain written policies as supporting their actions: the Transgender Students Guidelines (\"Guidelines\") and the Staff Conduct with Students Policy (\"Staff Conduct Policy\"). The Guidelines state, among other things, that their purpose is to foster a safe and nondiscriminatory learning environment; that administrators and staff are to consider student needs on a case-by-case basis; and that, in addressing needs raised by a transgender student, the school should develop a plan \"in consultation with the student, parent(s)\/guardian(s) and others as appropriate.\" The Guidelines do not contain any express directive to withhold information from parents or guardians. Lavigne alleges that these Guidelines are silent regarding the provision of chest binders or other devices to students with or without parental involvement, and that they do not mandate parental involvement in decisions about alternate names and pronouns. The Staff Conduct Policy includes an express prohibition on staff asking students to keep secrets.\n\nIn late December 2022, Lavigne addressed the Great Salt Bay Community School Board at a public meeting. She described the trust she believed had been broken by the defendants\u2019 withholding and concealment of information about her child's psychosexual development, and she stated that the school\u2019s decisions had driven a wedge between herself and A.B.\n\nFollowing the meeting, the Board issued two public statements, and Principal Schaff issued a separate statement. In its first statement, the Board said it could not discuss confidential student and staff information, emphasized that its priority was a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment, and noted that it had specific policies and procedures for addressing student and parent concerns. The Board stated that its policies comply with Maine law protecting the right of all students, regardless of gender or gender identity, to equal access to education, supports, and services, and protecting student privacy regardless of age. The statement did not name Lavigne, A.B., or any specific staff.\n\nIn a second statement in January 2023, the Board addressed recent bomb threats made to the school, which it attributed to a \"grossly inaccurate and one-sided story.\" Again emphasizing confidentiality obligations, the Board defended the school\u2019s \"ongoing and steadfast commitment\" to providing all students with safe and equal access to educational opportunities without discrimination. The Board cited Maine statutes allowing minors to consent to treatment for emotional or psychological problems without parental consent (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, \u00a7 1502) and protecting the confidentiality of school-based mental health counseling (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 20-A, \u00a7 4008). The Board stated that neither it nor school administration was aware of any violation of policy or law requiring further action.\n\nIn February 2023, Principal Schaff issued a separate statement largely addressing threats against the school and staff. She stated that under Maine law, a school counselor or social worker generally may not be required to divulge or release information gathered during a counseling relationship with a minor client, except as otherwise provided by law. Lavigne alleges that this statement did not explain how providing a chest binder or using alternate names and pronouns constitutes \"information gathered\" in counseling, and did not mention A.B. or Lavigne or discuss specific Great Salt policies.\n\nAfter Lavigne filed this lawsuit, the Board unanimously approved a second-year contract term for social worker Roy, who allegedly provided the chest binders to A.B. This post-suit contract renewal was not included in the original complaint but was later presented to the courts via a request for judicial notice.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In April 2023, Lavigne filed a civil action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Great Salt Bay Community School Board and four individual school employees (social workers Roy and Berk, Principal Schaff, and Superintendent Johnston), all in their official capacities. She alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions in concealing from her the provision of chest binders to A.B. and the use of an alternative name and pronouns at school violated her substantive due process rights as a parent to control and direct A.B.\u2019s education and upbringing. She also alleged a procedural due process violation based on being denied the opportunity to participate in decision-making regarding A.B.\u2019s gender-identity expression at school. She asserted municipal liability against the Board and claims against the individual defendants.",
        "district_court_decision":"The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing: (1) that the claims against the individual defendants in their official capacities were redundant of the municipal liability claim against the Board; (2) that the municipal liability claim failed because the complaint did not allege facts showing that any unconstitutional acts were caused by an official policy or custom of the Board; and (3) that even if such a policy existed, the alleged conduct did not violate Lavigne\u2019s constitutional rights. Lavigne opposed, arguing that keeping the individual defendants in the case would aid her ability to prove municipal liability, that her allegations showed the defendants acted pursuant to a policy or custom of withholding information from parents or that the Board ratified the conduct, and that she had sufficiently alleged constitutional violations.\n\nAfter a hearing, the district court granted the motion to dismiss as to the individual defendants (the two social workers, the principal, and the superintendent), reasoning that Lavigne was not seeking relief from them individually and that their testimony could be obtained without them being named defendants. The court took the remainder of the motion under advisement. In a subsequent written decision, the court granted the motion to dismiss as to the Board. The court characterized all of Lavigne\u2019s claims as centering on an alleged policy of withholding information from parents and concluded that the viability of the suit depended on whether she had adequately alleged such a policy. Focusing on the second element of municipal liability\u2014whether a municipal policy or custom was responsible for any constitutional violation\u2014the court determined that Lavigne had not plausibly alleged that a Board policy or custom caused the alleged violation. The court found her assertions of a \"withholding policy\" to be conclusory and unsupported by factual allegations, concluded that her allegations were insufficient to show a settled custom or practice of withholding information, and also found inadequate her theory that the Board had ratified the individual defendants\u2019 conduct via public statements or by renewing Roy\u2019s contract.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Lavigne filed a timely appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing her complaint. On appeal she challenges the dismissal of her \u00a7 1983 municipal liability claim against the Great Salt Bay Community School Board, contending that she adequately alleged that the Board had a policy or custom of withholding information about students\u2019 gender identity and expression from parents, or alternatively, that the Board ratified the challenged conduct, and that the district court erred in addressing only the second element of municipal liability.

The Board\u2019s public statements are high\u2011level defenses of the school\u2019s overall compliance with law and policy and an insistence on student confidentiality, without acknowledging any specific decision to provide binders or to use alternate names\/pronouns for A.B., and without articulating the underlying reasoning for those specific actions. They read as generalized assurances rather than explicit adoption of the complained\u2011of conduct. Likewise, renewing Roy\u2019s contract\u2014especially as a routine employment action taken after litigation had commenced\u2014does not, without more, amount to a clear, deliberate endorsement of his particular handling of A.B.\u2019s case and the basis for it. First Circuit and other precedent treat such vague approvals and inaction as insufficient to constitute ratification under Monell. Taking the pleaded facts as true, the complaint does not plausibly allege the kind of active, specific ratification needed to create municipal liability from a single incident, so dismissal on this theory is properly sustained."

Here, the district court did exactly that\u2014treating the case as turning on the second Monell element and declining to reach the parental-rights question.

Ludlow School Committee, holds that a school\u2019s honoring a student\u2019s preferred name and pronouns, and related confidentiality practices, do not amount to the kind of direct, coercive, and substantial interference with parental decisionmaking that substantive due process protects. Here, school staff did not remove the child from parental custody, prevent the parent from communicating with the child, or bar her from making medical or educational choices; they interacted with the student in the school setting and, as alleged, did not volunteer certain information to the parent. Against the backdrop of state laws expressly allowing minors to obtain confidential mental\u2011health\u2011related services, the school\u2019s conduct does not plausibly rise to the level of arbitrary, conscience\u2011shocking interference with a fundamental parental right.

Applying de novo review, the appellate court is likely to agree that the complaint\u2019s assertions of a \u2018blanket policy\u2019 are conclusory and supported only by one incident and general post\u2011hoc statements that the school complied with law and policy, while the written policies actually undercut the alleged unwritten practice. That is insufficient under Monell to plead a policy, custom, or ratification. In addition, in light of Foote and similar cases, the panel can comfortably hold in the alternative that the alleged conduct does not amount to a substantive due process violation of parental rights. With both Monell and the merits leaning against Lavigne, and with no procedural error in the district court\u2019s sequencing of its analysis, the most consistent outcome is a complete affirmance of the dismissal."

It places foreign nationals as live-in au pairs with host families throughout the United States.\n\nThe named plaintiffs are foreign nationals who participated in that au pair program as au pairs. They allege that Cultural Care violated federal and state wage-and-hour laws and state deceptive trade practices laws in connection with their work as au pairs and the compensation and treatment they received.\n\nTwo different contracts are relevant to Cultural Care\u2019s later effort to compel arbitration:\n\n1. A \"2023 Contract\" that Cultural Care asserts all au pairs entering the program beginning in January 2023 signed directly with Cultural Care, containing an arbitration clause. The named plaintiffs all began their au pair work before 2023.\n\n2. A contract used between January 2018 and December 2022 (the \"ICL Contract\"), which plaintiffs allegedly signed not with Cultural Care, Inc. but with International Care Ltd. (ICL), a Swiss company that is separate and distinct from Cultural Care, Inc. ICL used \"Cultural Care\" as a registered business name and performed recruiting, screening, and pre-departure services in connection with the au pair program. The ICL Contract set forth terms and conditions of the au pairs\u2019 participation in the program and contained an arbitration provision stating that, for any claim, dispute, or proceeding arising out of the relationship between the au pair and ICL, or any claim in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity arising between the parties, the parties submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of arbitral tribunals in Switzerland.\n\nThe ICL Contract also contained other provisions that Cultural Care later pointed to as conferring benefits on it, including a release clause in which the au pair \"release[s] and forever discharge[s] [ICL] and its affiliates\" from claims arising out of illness, injury, damage, or loss resulting from or during participation in the au pair program. Cultural Care contends that it is an \"affiliate\" of ICL under this clause.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In February 2021, the named plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of themselves and a putative class of similarly situated foreign-national au pairs. They asserted: (1) claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for failure to pay legal wages for their work as au pairs; (2) claims under various state wage-and-hour statutes for the same alleged underpayment; and (3) claims under state deceptive trade practices laws.",
        "district_court_decision":"Cultural Care moved to dismiss the complaint on multiple grounds, including that it was entitled to derivative sovereign immunity under Yearsley v. W.A. Ross Construction Co. because of its status as a State Department\u2013designated sponsor. The district court denied the motion in part, including rejecting the Yearsley immunity defense.\n\nCultural Care filed an interlocutory appeal, invoking the collateral order doctrine to seek review of the denial of its Yearsley-based motion to dismiss and asking the First Circuit to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over its other dismissal grounds. The First Circuit, after oral argument and receiving an amicus brief from the State Department, upheld the district court\u2019s partial denial of the motion to dismiss on the Yearsley issue and declined pendent appellate jurisdiction over the remaining grounds. After mandate issued and the case returned to the district court, Cultural Care filed an answer to the operative complaint (July 7, 2023) asserting, among other defenses, that plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the putative class action were barred by arbitration agreements.\n\nOn August 18, 2023, Cultural Care moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention). The parties stipulated to and conducted limited discovery relating to arbitration. Plaintiffs opposed the motion on various grounds. On February 28, 2024, the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration.\n\nAs to the 2023 Contract, the court denied the motion without prejudice insofar as it relied on that contract because Cultural Care produced no evidence that the 2023 Contract bound any of the named plaintiffs, all of whom began their au pair service before 2023, and Cultural Care had not identified any opt-in plaintiff who signed the 2023 Contract. Cultural Care did not appeal that portion of the ruling.\n\nAs to the ICL Contract, which Cultural Care asserted all au pairs sponsored between January 2018 and December 2022 (including the named plaintiffs) signed with ICL, the district court assumed\u2014solely for purposes of the motion\u2014that Cultural Care had met its burden to show the named plaintiffs signed the ICL Contract, because plaintiffs had not offered contrary evidence or challenged the authenticity of contracts produced. The court then held that Cultural Care, as a nonsignatory, could not compel arbitration under the ICL Contract. The court gave two independent reasons: (1) Cultural Care had waived any right to compel arbitration by substantially invoking the litigation machinery (fully litigating a motion to dismiss on the merits, pursuing an interlocutory appeal including non-immunity arguments, opposing conditional class certification, and moving to strike consents to sue) without mentioning arbitration; and (2) even absent waiver, Cultural Care could not enforce the ICL arbitration clause either as a third-party beneficiary or under equitable estoppel. On the third-party-beneficiary theory, the court concluded that the ICL Contract did not show with the required 'special clarity' an intent to benefit Cultural Care through the arbitration agreement. On equitable estoppel, it found plaintiffs\u2019 statutory wage-and-hour and consumer claims did not depend on the ICL Contract or require reference to it. The court also rejected Cultural Care\u2019s argument that the ICL Contract delegated arbitrability questions to the arbitrator, holding that Cultural Care, as a nonsignatory, could not invoke any such delegation clause.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Cultural Care timely appealed from the district court\u2019s order denying its motion to compel arbitration. On appeal, it challenges the district court\u2019s conclusions that: (1) Cultural Care may not enforce any delegation provision in the ICL Contract to send questions of arbitrability to an arbitrator; (2) Cultural Care, as a nonsignatory, is not entitled under federal common law and Swiss law to enforce the ICL arbitration agreement as a third-party beneficiary; and (3) Cultural Care cannot compel arbitration under the doctrine of equitable estoppel because plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claims are not sufficiently intertwined with, or dependent on, the ICL Contract. Cultural Care does not appeal the denial without prejudice of its motion to compel arbitration insofar as it was based on the 2023 Contract."

          "On third-party-beneficiary status, Cultural Care contends that it is an intended beneficiary of the ICL Contract because several of its provisions, while naming only ICL, functionally benefit Cultural Care as the State Department\u2013designated sponsor that oversees the au pairs in the United States. It argues that ICL, which handles recruiting, screening, and pre-departure tasks, does not truly benefit from certain provisions relating to au pairs\u2019 conduct in the U.S., making Cultural Care 'the only possible intended beneficiary' of those clauses.",
          "Cultural Care further relies on the ICL Contract\u2019s release clause, which releases ICL and its 'affiliates' from claims arising during participation in the program. It contends it is an 'affiliate' of ICL and that this release was 'expressly intended for [its] benefit,' thereby making it a third-party beneficiary. It maintains that being an intended third-party beneficiary of the contract (based on that release and other provisions) suffices to confer the right to enforce the arbitration clause, and that focusing on whether the arbitration clause itself names or refers to Cultural Care is a 'category error.'",
          "Cultural Care relies on federal common law and on opinions of its Swiss-law expert to argue that, under both legal systems, a third-party beneficiary need not be expressly named in the contract and that a third party benefiting from key provisions has a right to enforce the arbitration agreement. It cites a Swiss Federal Supreme Court decision and its expert\u2019s declaration to support its claim that Swiss law would treat it as a third-party beneficiary with a right to compel arbitration.",

Cultural Care contends that plaintiffs\u2019 theory that Cultural Care controlled their terms and conditions of employment necessarily 'stems from' the powers and policies established in the ICL Contract and that plaintiffs cannot simultaneously rely on those program structures while avoiding the arbitration obligation.

They contend that their statutory claims would exist even if the ICL Contract did not, making equitable estoppel inappropriate.",

Sundance) eliminates any \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement in some circuits, Cultural Care still loses under a straightforward intent\/conduct analysis: its prolonged silence and active litigation behavior are inconsistent with preserving a right to arbitrate. The district court\u2019s waiver ruling is therefore likely to be upheld."

The district court rejected each theory\u2014delegation, third\u2011party beneficiary, equitable estoppel\u2014and, independently, found waiver. On de novo review of these contract and arbitrability questions, the First Circuit is likely to: (1) hold that the New York Convention does not override the requirement that a nonsignatory demonstrate a valid doctrinal basis to enforce an arbitration agreement; (2) agree that no such basis exists here, because the ICL Contract does not manifest with \u2018special clarity\u2019 an intent to confer arbitration rights on Cultural Care, and plaintiffs\u2019 statutory claims are not sufficiently intertwined with the ICL Contract to trigger equitable estoppel; and (3) conclude that Cultural Care\u2019s extensive prior litigation conduct, including a merits\u2011laden interlocutory appeal, supports a finding of waiver. With all three core arguments for compelling arbitration rejected, the denial of the motion to compel arbitration is likely to be affirmed in full. Accordingly, the overall outcome on appeal is an affirmation of the district court\u2019s order."

      },
      "factual_background":"The case concerns the interaction between a federal statute that limits civil liability for the firearms industry and a New York statute that creates firearms\u2011specific public\u2011nuisance liability.\n\nIn 2005, Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901\u20137903. PLCAA was enacted \"to prohibit causes of action\" against firearms manufacturers, sellers, and trade associations for harm \"solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse\" of firearms or ammunition by others when the product functions as designed. PLCAA defines a barred \"qualified civil liability action\" as essentially any civil or administrative proceeding seeking damages or other relief resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by a person or third party, and generally provides that such actions may not be maintained. At the same time, PLCAA preserves certain types of suits, including those falling within the so\u2011called \"predicate exception\": actions in which a manufacturer or seller \"knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing\" of firearms, and the violation was a proximate cause of the alleged harm.\n\nIn prior litigation, City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., New York City brought a public\u2011nuisance action against firearms manufacturers and wholesalers under New York\u2019s general criminal nuisance statute, Penal Law \u00a7 240.45 (criminal nuisance in the second degree), alleging that the defendants knowingly supplied the illegal firearms market. When PLCAA was enacted, the firearms defendants moved to dismiss that case as barred; the City argued its nuisance claim fit within the predicate exception because \u00a7 240.45 was a statute applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms and had been knowingly violated. The federal courts concluded that the general nuisance statute was not a predicate statute within PLCAA\u2019s exception because it was a statute of general applicability that had not expressly regulated, nor been specifically applied to, the sale and marketing of firearms.\n\nIn July 2021, New York enacted General Business Law \u00a7 898\u2011a\u2013e, a gun\u2011specific public\u2011nuisance statute. Section 898 targets \"gun industry members,\" defined as entities engaged in the sale, manufacturing, distribution, importing, or marketing of firearms, ammunition, ammunition magazines, and firearms accessories. The statute was adopted against a backdrop of concern about gun violence in New York and was expressly designed, according to its sponsor memorandum, to serve as a predicate statute \"applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms\" for purposes of the PLCAA predicate exception.\n\nSection 898\u2011b(1) provides that no gun industry member, by conduct that is either unlawful in itself or unreasonable under all the circumstances, shall knowingly or recklessly create, maintain, or contribute to a condition in New York State that endangers the safety or health of the public through the sale, manufacturing, importing, or marketing of a \"qualified product.\" Section 898\u2011b(2) requires all gun industry members who manufacture, market, import, or offer for wholesale or retail sale any qualified product in New York State to \"establish and utilize reasonable controls and procedures\" to prevent those products from being possessed, used, marketed, or sold unlawfully in New York.\n\n\"Reasonable controls and procedures\" are defined to include policies such as screening, security, inventory, and other business practices designed to prevent thefts of qualified products and sales to straw purchasers, traffickers, prohibited persons, or persons at risk of self\u2011harm or harm to others, as well as measures to prevent deceptive acts, false advertising, and to ensure compliance with New York\u2019s consumer\u2011protection provisions. Section 898 declares violations to be a public nuisance and authorizes civil actions and enforcement by various public officials and private parties.\n\nAt the time the suit was filed, the term \"qualified product\" in Section 898 cross\u2011referenced PLCAA\u2019s definition, which limited the term to firearms, ammunition, and component parts that had been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. After oral argument in the appeal, New York amended Section 898 to remove that cross\u2011reference and the explicit reference to interstate commerce from the state statute\u2019s definition of \"qualified product.\" The amended definition no longer turns on whether the product has moved in interstate commerce.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In December 2021, National Shooting Sports Foundation and fourteen named firearms industry members\u2014each of which ships or transports firearms and ammunition directly into New York\u2014filed a pre\u2011enforcement civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York against the New York Attorney General in her official capacity. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a preliminary injunction, to bar enforcement of New York General Business Law \u00a7 898. They alleged that Section 898 is: (1) preempted by PLCAA under the Supremacy Clause (both as an express preemption and conflict\u2011preemption matter), characterizing Section 898 as an impermissible effort to reinstate liability that PLCAA forbids; (2) unconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause because it regulates and burdens interstate commerce and discriminates against it, including by focusing on products that have moved in interstate commerce and by reaching wholly out\u2011of\u2011state actors; and (3) unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, on the ground that its \"reasonableness\" and \"contribute\" standards do not give regulated parties sufficient notice of required or prohibited conduct, especially in light of prior New York law regarding duties owed by firearms manufacturers.",
        "district_court_decision":"The State moved to dismiss the complaint. Plaintiffs simultaneously sought a preliminary injunction. In May 2022, the district court (Judge D\u2019Agostino) granted the State\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. On preemption, the court concluded that Section 898 is not expressly preempted by PLCAA because, unlike the general nuisance statute at issue in Beretta, Section 898 directly and specifically regulates firearms and therefore fits within PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception. The court further determined there was no implied conflict preemption because Section 898 did not frustrate or conflict with PLCAA\u2019s goals as the court understood them, including PLCAA\u2019s objective of preventing generally applicable laws from being used to create novel, attenuated liability theories against the firearms industry without notice.\n\nOn the dormant Commerce Clause claims, the district court held that Section 898 did not discriminate against interstate commerce because the statute treated in\u2011state and out\u2011of\u2011state entities alike and plaintiffs had not identified any purely intrastate gun commerce that would receive a competitive advantage. Applying Pike v. Bruce Church, the court found no undue burden on interstate commerce, reasoning that plaintiffs had not shown any favoritism for intrastate commerce or an imbalance between burdens on interstate commerce and local benefits. The court also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 extraterritoriality argument, concluding that the statute, although it might have effects beyond New York\u2019s borders, did not regulate commerce occurring wholly outside New York in a way materially different from many other state laws.\n\nOn the vagueness challenge, the district court held that Section 898 was not facially void for vagueness. It found that the statute provided sufficient notice to a reasonable person of what conduct was prohibited or required, given the statutory text and examples of \"reasonable controls and procedures.\" The court also noted that, even if some vagueness concerns could arise in specific applications, the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that the statute would be unconstitutional in all its applications, which is required for a facial vagueness challenge.",

          "PLCAA conflict preemption: Appellants alternatively assert that even if Section 898 qualifies as a predicate statute in the abstract, it is impliedly preempted by PLCAA because it would allow suits that do not meet PLCAA\u2019s mandatory elements for the predicate exception. Specifically, they argue that Section 898 does not require that violations be committed \"knowingly\" or that they be proven to be a \"proximate cause\" of the harm, while PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception does. Because Section 898 authorizes liability for \"reckless\" conduct and does not expressly incorporate a proximate\u2011cause requirement, appellants contend it creates a direct conflict with PLCAA and stands as an obstacle to Congress\u2019s objectives by opening the door to precisely the sorts of suits PLCAA was intended to foreclose.",
          "Dormant Commerce Clause \u2014 discrimination and undue burden: Appellants argue that Section 898 discriminates against interstate commerce because, as originally enacted, it applied only to \"qualified products\" defined by cross\u2011reference to PLCAA as products that have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. They maintain that, in practice, this means the statute targets and burdens interstate and mostly out\u2011of\u2011state firearms commerce, while effectively incentivizing intrastate commerce (including any hypothetical purely intrastate gun manufacturing or sales) that would lie outside the statute\u2019s reach. They contend that, under Pike, the burdens on interstate commerce are clearly excessive relative to any local safety benefits, pointing to congressional findings in PLCAA that lawsuits of this type threaten public confidence in the legal system, restrict lawful access to firearms, and destabilize law\u2011abiding industries.",
          "Dormant Commerce Clause \u2014 extraterritoriality: Appellants further argue that Section 898 operates extraterritorially because it can be enforced against out\u2011of\u2011state gun industry members that do not conduct business in New York, based solely on out\u2011of\u2011state conduct that ultimately results in firearms reaching New York. They characterize this as New York imposing its regulatory preferences on conduct occurring wholly in other states, which they assert is forbidden by dormant Commerce Clause cases prohibiting state laws with the practical effect of controlling commerce beyond the state\u2019s borders.",
          "Vagueness: Appellants contend that Section 898 is unconstitutionally vague on its face. They argue that the statute\u2019s standards\u2014such as requiring \"reasonable controls and procedures\" and prohibiting conduct that \"creates, maintains or contributes to a condition\" that endangers public safety\u2014do not provide concrete guidance as to what specific practices are required or forbidden. They point out that New York courts had previously held that gun manufacturers generally do not owe a duty to control the conduct of third parties to prevent them from harming others, so industry members lack any established legal baseline for what duties they now owe under Section 898. According to appellants, the statute\u2019s broad, open\u2011ended terms invite \"freewheeling\" liability and effectively force compliant manufacturers to guess at what measures might satisfy the standard or to leave the New York market altogether to avoid unpredictable liability. They argue that this lack of clear standards both fails to give fair notice and risks arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, rendering the statute void for vagueness.",
          "Nature of the challenge: Although their complaint repeatedly described their suit as a facial challenge and sought to have Section 898 declared unconstitutional in its entirety, appellants argue on appeal that their challenge has \"characteristics of both facial and as\u2011applied challenges\" because they target discrete potential applications they say are likely to occur (e.g., applications reaching purely out\u2011of\u2011state conduct, or allowing liability without proof of knowing violation or proximate cause). They suggest that the court could invalidate Section 898 \"to the extent\" it is preempted, regulates out\u2011of\u2011state commerce, discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce, or is void for vagueness."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "PLCAA and predicate exception: The State argues that PLCAA was enacted primarily to prevent courts from using generally applicable tort or nuisance theories to impose novel and far\u2011reaching liability on the firearms industry, without prior legislative authorization. In its view, PLCAA\u2019s structure and findings show Congress intended to preserve room for federal and state legislatures to regulate firearms directly, including by creating statutory duties whose knowing violation could serve as a predicate for liability. The State contends that Section 898 squarely fits within PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception because it is a statute that expressly regulates firearms and the firearms industry\u2019s sales and marketing practices, rather than a general nuisance statute. It emphasizes that PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception is not limited to the two illustrative examples in the statutory text and that, under Second Circuit precedent in Beretta, a predicate statute includes any law that expressly regulates firearms, has been applied to the sale or marketing of firearms, or clearly implicates firearms sales. On that understanding, the State maintains that Section 898 is not barred by PLCAA.",
          "Response to conflict\u2011preemption theory: On the argument that Section 898 may authorize suits without satisfying PLCAA\u2019s \"knowing\" and \"proximate cause\" requirements, the State contends that the existence of such hypothetical applications does not establish facial conflict preemption. It argues that the statute can be applied in ways that fully comply with PLCAA\u2014such as suits alleging that a manufacturer knowingly violated Section 898 and that this violation proximately caused a victim\u2019s injury\u2014and that preemption issues, if any, should be resolved in case\u2011specific, as\u2011applied challenges should such suits arise. The State emphasizes that facial preemption requires showing that the state law necessarily conflicts with federal law in all its applications, which appellants have not done.",
          "Dormant Commerce Clause \u2014 discrimination and undue burden: The State argues that Section 898 does not discriminate against interstate commerce because it applies evenhandedly to all \"gun industry members\" who manufacture, market, import, or sell qualified products in New York, regardless of where they are based, and because appellants have not identified any in\u2011state competitors that benefit from more favorable treatment. It further asserts that the mere fact that most or all affected firms are engaged in interstate commerce does not itself constitute discrimination. Regarding undue burden under Pike, the State maintains that appellants have not made a factual showing that Section 898 imposes burdens on interstate commerce that are clearly excessive relative to New York\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting public health and safety by reducing unlawful gun use. It characterizes appellants\u2019 asserted harms (such as erosion of legal norms or destabilization of industries) as speculative and not tied to specific evidence about the statute\u2019s economic impacts.",
          "Dormant Commerce Clause \u2014 extraterritoriality: The State contends that Section 898 does not regulate wholly extraterritorial conduct because each operative provision includes a New York connection: it covers conditions \"in New York state\" that endanger public safety and covers gun industry members who manufacture, market, import, or offer qualified products for sale \"in New York state.\" The State maintains that the statute is directed at protecting New York residents from harms associated with unlawful or unreasonable firearms practices that affect New York, and that it does not, in its terms, dictate how commerce must be conducted entirely outside the state. It argues that hypothetical applications to entities with no New York contacts are not a basis for facial invalidation and that any such issues should be addressed, if they arise, in as\u2011applied challenges.",
          "Vagueness: The State asserts that Section 898 is not unconstitutionally vague. It argues that the \"reasonableness\" standard is a well\u2011established legal concept used in numerous statutes and common\u2011law doctrines, particularly in public nuisance and negligence law, and that industry members can look to that body of law for guidance. The statute further defines \"reasonable controls and procedures\" and provides illustrative examples\u2014such as screening for straw purchasers and maintaining security and inventory practices\u2014to clarify required conduct. The State contends that these examples, together with the statutory language and existing case law on similar nuisance provisions, provide sufficient notice and constrain enforcement discretion. It emphasizes that facial vagueness challenges are disfavored and that appellants have not shown the statute to be so indefinite that it could never be validly applied.",
          "Nature of the challenge: The State argues that this is properly characterized as a facial, pre\u2011enforcement challenge because appellants have not identified any specific course of conduct they would pursue but for fear of enforcement, and because they seek to have Section 898 declared invalid in toto and unenforceable against anyone. It stresses that facial challenges are \"the most difficult\" to sustain, requiring a showing that the statute is invalid in all its applications, and contends that appellants\u2019 reliance on hypotheticals is insufficient under that standard."

Under Beretta, a predicate statute under PLCAA includes any statute that expressly regulates firearms or clearly implicates their sale or marketing, not just the two enumerated federal examples. Section 898 is a gun\u2011specific statute that directly regulates the sale, marketing, and distribution practices of firearms and related products, so it fits comfortably within the predicate exception as construed by the Second Circuit. The challengers frame Section 898 as a mere relabeling of the Beretta nuisance theory, but Congress left room for legislatures to create such firearms\u2011specific duties. On conflict preemption, a facial challenge requires showing that the state law necessarily conflicts with PLCAA in all its applications. Section 898 can readily be enforced in suits that allege a knowing violation and proximate causation, which would track PLCAA\u2019s predicate requirements. The fact that the statute also contemplates recklessness or does not textually spell out \u2018proximate cause\u2019 does not create an unavoidable conflict; any specific suit that omits those elements can be dismissed or limited in light of PLCAA at the case\u2011specific stage.

Section 898 is evenhanded on its face: it applies to any \u2018gun industry member\u2019 whose products are manufactured, marketed, imported, or sold in New York, regardless of origin. The former cross\u2011reference to PLCAA\u2019s \u2018interstate commerce\u2019 definition does not create in\u2011state favoritism; plaintiffs identify no purely intrastate New York gun industry that is exempted or given a competitive advantage. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent emphasis that the dormant Commerce Clause primarily targets economic protectionism, the absence of favored in\u2011state competitors is fatal to the discrimination claim. Under Pike, facial invalidation requires a clear excess of burden over local benefit; plaintiffs offer only generalized references to PLCAA\u2019s findings and speculative assertions about industry destabilization, against New York\u2019s recognized, substantial interest in addressing gun violence and unlawful diversion. That is inadequate at the pleading stage to show a clearly excessive burden. On extraterritoriality, Section 898 is anchored to New York: it addresses conditions \u2018in New York state\u2019 and actors whose qualified products are made, marketed, imported, or sold \u2018in New York state.\u2019 Any incidental influence on out\u2011of\u2011state conduct is of the same type routinely tolerated for state laws protecting in\u2011state health and safety. Because there are numerous constitutional applications\u2014e.g., to manufacturers and distributors with clear New York contacts\u2014the facial dormant Commerce Clause challenge fails and the dismissal is properly affirmed."

The fact that New York common law previously recognized no general duty for gun manufacturers to control third\u2011party misuse does not render the new statutory duty unintelligible; legislatures frequently alter or expand duties. At a minimum, the statute is clearly valid in many applications, such as where an industry member entirely fails to implement any of the listed controls and that failure foreseeably facilitates unlawful trafficking into New York.

That posture fits the paradigm of a facial challenge.

      "reasoning":"All of the issues on appeal turn on de novo review of legal questions raised in a pre\u2011enforcement, facial challenge. The plaintiffs\u2019 theories are structurally weak in that facial invalidation requires showing that the statute is inconsistent with federal law or the Constitution in all or virtually all its applications. On preemption, Second Circuit precedent in Beretta already delineates the scope of PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception and supports the conclusion that firearms\u2011specific statutes like Section 898 qualify. Any potential mismatch between Section 898\u2019s elements and PLCAA\u2019s \u2018knowing violation\u2019 and \u2018proximate cause\u2019 requirements can be resolved in case\u2011specific fashion; that possibility alone defeats a facial conflict\u2011preemption claim. On the dormant Commerce Clause, post\u2011Beretta case law and recent Supreme Court guidance emphasize economic protectionism and concrete evidence of discriminatory or clearly excessive burdens, which the plaintiffs do not plausibly allege. The statute\u2019s New York nexus provisions and evenhanded application further undercut discrimination and extraterritoriality theories. Regarding vagueness, the statute\u2019s use of commonplace reasonableness language, paired with enumerated examples of \u2018reasonable controls and procedures,\u2019 comfortably surpasses the minimal clarity required for economic regulation, especially on a facial standard. Finally, the district court correctly treated the suit as a facial, pre\u2011enforcement challenge and applied the stringent \u2018no set of circumstances\u2019 framework. Taken together, these considerations make it highly likely that the appellate court will affirm the dismissal of the complaint and the denial of preliminary injunctive relief in full."

      "factual_background":"In 2016, Massachusetts voters approved the Act to Prevent Cruelty to Farm Animals (the \u201cMassachusetts Act\u201d), codified in Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 129, App. \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20111 to 1\u20115. The Act\u2019s stated purpose is to prevent animal cruelty by phasing out extreme methods of farm animal confinement, which the statute associates with risks to consumer health, increased foodborne illness, and negative fiscal impacts on the Commonwealth.\n\nAs relevant to this case, the Act regulates the confinement of breeding pigs and the in\u2011state sale of certain pork products:\n- It prohibits any pig farmer within Massachusetts from knowingly confining a breeding pig \u201cin a cruel manner,\u201d which is defined, in pertinent part, as confining the animal in a way that prevents it from lying down, standing up, fully extending its limbs, or turning around freely. \u201cTurning around freely\u201d is further defined as turning in a complete circle without impediment, including a tether, and without touching the side of an enclosure or another animal.\n- It also makes it unlawful for a \u201cbusiness owner or operator\u201d to knowingly engage in the sale within Massachusetts of whole pork meat that the business knows or should know is derived from a breeding pig that was confined in a cruel manner, or from the immediate offspring of such a pig. A \u201csale\u201d is defined as a commercial sale by a business of items covered by \u00a7 1\u20113 and is deemed to occur at the location where the buyer takes physical possession of the product.\n\nThe Act also includes provisions covering other animals and products (such as eggs and veal), but the litigation here focuses on its application to pigs and whole pork meat. A covered animal is not deemed to be confined in a cruel manner during slaughter conducted in accordance with applicable laws.\n\nAlthough enacted in 2016, enforcement of the Act was delayed by litigation and related developments and ultimately became enforceable on August 24, 2023, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in National Pork Producers Council v. Ross.\n\nThe plaintiffs are a group of out\u2011of\u2011state pig farmers and a pork processing company, Triumph Foods, LLC, which they co\u2011own. They operate in multiple states outside Massachusetts, including Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Missouri, Wyoming, and Indiana. Their operations use gestation crates\u2014stalls so small breeding pigs cannot lie down, stand up, or turn around\u2014of the sort proscribed by the Massachusetts Act. Pork produced by Triumph is sold nationwide, including in Massachusetts. According to plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, no Massachusetts pig farmers used gestation crates for breeding sows at the time the Act was passed, and thus, in their view, the burdens of compliance fall predominantly on out\u2011of\u2011state farmers and processors.\n\nPlaintiffs assert that, to continue selling into the Massachusetts market, they would need to change housing practices for their breeding pigs or segregate and trace compliant animals and meat, which they contend would impose additional costs, delays, or logistical burdens. They further allege that some of the states in which they operate have \u201cRight to Farm\u201d statutes or regulations that protect existing farming practices.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On July 25, 2023, shortly before the Massachusetts Act became enforceable, plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent enforcement of the Act. They filed an amended complaint on July 31, 2023, alleging ten causes of action:\n1. Dormant Commerce Clause violations, asserting both (a) direct\/intentional discrimination against interstate commerce and (b) an undue or substantial burden on interstate commerce under Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.\n2. Privileges and Immunities Clause violations (Art. IV, \u00a7 2).\n3. Express preemption under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA).\n4. Conflict preemption under the FMIA.\n5. Preemption under the Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA).\n6. Full Faith and Credit Clause violations, based on alleged conflicts with other states\u2019 Right to Farm laws.\n7. Due Process Clause violations, including a vagueness challenge to the terms \u201cengage in the sale\u201d and \u201cturn around freely.\u201d\n8. Import-Export Clause violations.\n9. Declaratory relief that the Act is unconstitutional.\n10. Judicial review of regulations implementing the Act.\n\nIn support of these claims, plaintiffs alleged that the Act discriminates against out\u2011of\u2011state farmers and processors in purpose and effect because, in their view, no Massachusetts pig farmers were using the confined housing methods that the Act prohibits when it passed.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court consolidated the hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction with a trial on the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(1).\n\nOn September 28, 2023, the Massachusetts Attorney General\u2019s Office moved to dismiss the amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing, among other things, that:\n- The Act does not discriminate against interstate commerce on its face, in purpose, or in effect.\n- Plaintiffs\u2019 Pike-based dormant Commerce Clause theory is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in National Pork Producers Council v. Ross.\n\nThe district court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss as to all claims except the dormant Commerce Clause claim (Count I). The court did not issue a separate written opinion explaining the dismissal of Counts II\u2013X, and plaintiffs later characterized this as a dismissal \u201cwithout a written order\u201d and \u201cwithout any reasoning on the record.\u201d\n\nAs to the remaining dormant Commerce Clause claim, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, focusing on their direct discrimination theory and arguing that the discrimination issue could be decided on the statute\u2019s face and publicly available, undisputed materials, without factual development. Massachusetts opposed and requested that the court enter summary judgment in its favor, including sua sponte relief on the Pike theory.\n\nIn connection with Count I, the district court identified and severed a particular statutory provision, known as the \u201cslaughterhouse exception\u201d or \u201cslaughterhouse exemption,\u201d which had provided an exemption from the Act\u2019s requirements for pork products sold on the premises of a federally inspected (FMIA\u2011inspected) facility. The court concluded that this provision discriminated against out\u2011of\u2011state farmers and therefore severed it from the statute. After severance, the court proceeded to address the remaining portions of the Act.\n\nThe district court then entered summary judgment against all plaintiffs except Triumph Foods on the dormant Commerce Clause claim. As to the Pike theory, the court treated Massachusetts\u2019s opposition as seeking summary judgment in its favor and concluded that, in light of National Pork Producers Council v. Ross and the record, the Pike claim was foreclosed as a matter of law. The court also concluded that there were no genuine disputes of material fact and that discovery had progressed sufficiently (including what plaintiffs had described as \u201cextensive discovery\u201d related to Pike issues). As to the intentional discrimination theory, the court determined that the Act did not discriminate against plaintiffs in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.\n\nOn the federal preemption claims, after severing the slaughterhouse exception, the district court considered plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the FMIA and the PSA preempt the Act. It determined that the Act did not impose additional or different requirements on the premises, facilities, or operations of federally inspected establishments within the meaning of FMIA\u2019s express preemption clause and thus was not expressly preempted. It further concluded that the Act did not stand as an obstacle to, or render it impossible to comply with, the FMIA or PSA and therefore was not conflict-preempted. The court accordingly granted summary judgment to Massachusetts on the FMIA and PSA preemption theories.\n\nThe district court also rejected plaintiffs\u2019 remaining constitutional challenges, including their claims under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Due Process Clause (vagueness), and the Import-Export Clause, as well as their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. Some of those claims were dismissed at the Rule 12 stage; others were resolved at summary judgment. The court\u2019s rulings left plaintiffs without relief from the Act\u2019s enforcement, aside from the severed slaughterhouse exception.",
        "what_is_appealed":"On appeal to the First Circuit, plaintiffs challenge multiple aspects of the district court\u2019s rulings:\n- The Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals of Counts II\u2013X (Privileges and Immunities, FMIA and PSA preemption, Full Faith and Credit, Due Process\/vagueness, Import-Export Clause, and related declaratory\/injunctive claims), particularly the court\u2019s dismissal of these counts without a separate written order setting out reasoning.\n- The sua sponte entry of summary judgment against them on the Pike dormant Commerce Clause claim, including whether the district court complied with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) (notice and reasonable time to respond), given plaintiffs\u2019 contention that they had not moved for summary judgment on Pike and had not presented evidence on that theory.\n- The sua sponte grant of summary judgment in favor of Massachusetts on the intentional\/discriminatory dormant Commerce Clause theory, again raising notice and Rule 56(f) concerns and arguing that the Act discriminates against out-of-state producers in purpose and effect.\n- The district court\u2019s determinations that the Act is not preempted by the Federal Meat Inspection Act (express or conflict preemption) or the Packers and Stockyards Act (conflict preemption).\n- The district court\u2019s rejection of their Privileges and Immunities, Full Faith and Credit, Due Process (vagueness), and Import-Export Clause challenges, although these are pressed with varying levels of development on appeal."

          "Regarding sua sponte summary judgment on the Pike dormant Commerce Clause claim, plaintiffs contend they sought partial summary judgment only on their direct discrimination theory and did not move for summary judgment on the Pike theory. They assert that their motion accordingly contained no evidentiary record specifically developed for the Pike claim, that Massachusetts did not formally move for summary judgment on Pike, and that the district court granted summary judgment on that theory without the notice and opportunity to respond required by Rule 56(f). They emphasize that material factual disputes exist about the burden the Act imposes on interstate commerce, including costs, supply chain disruptions, and market impacts, which they believe preclude summary judgment.",
          "On the direct discrimination dormant Commerce Clause theory, plaintiffs argue that the Act was designed and operates to disadvantage out\u2011of\u2011state producers. They cite statements from the Act\u2019s legislative and political history, including references to the absence of gestation crate use by Massachusetts pig farmers and the fact that Massachusetts consumes meat produced out of state using those methods, as evidence of discriminatory purpose. They assert that, because no Massachusetts pig farmers used gestation crates when the Act was passed, the Act\u2019s minimum confinement requirements functionally burden only out\u2011of\u2011state producers, conferring a competitive advantage on in\u2011state farmers and processors and disadvantaging them in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.",
          "On the Pike issue, plaintiffs contend that the Act imposes a substantial burden on interstate commerce by forcing nationwide changes in production methods, housing, and supply chain practices for pork sold in Massachusetts, or alternatively requiring costly segregation and traceability systems. They attempt to distinguish National Pork Producers Council v. Ross by noting that the plaintiffs in that case conceded there was no discrimination and by arguing that the part of National Pork the district court relied upon lacked a majority. They also argue that at least five justices in National Pork would have allowed a Pike claim to proceed on allegations similar to theirs, and that the district court erred in treating National Pork as effectively foreclosing Pike balancing altogether.",
          "On FMIA preemption, plaintiffs argue that even after the severance of the slaughterhouse exception, the Massachusetts Act is expressly and conflict-preempted by the FMIA. They contend that the Act functions, like the California statute at issue in National Meat Ass\u2019n v. Harris, as a regulation of slaughterhouses and meat that intrudes into a field occupied by federal law. In their view, by prohibiting the sale of non\u2011compliant meat and effectively determining what meat may be sold as fit for commerce in Massachusetts based on animal confinement methods, the Act adds a class of adulteration unrecognized by federal law and imposes additional or different requirements with respect to FMIA\u2011regulated establishments\u2019 operations. They further argue that this frustrates the FMIA\u2019s uniform federal scheme for meat inspection and slaughterhouse regulation and therefore stands as an obstacle to Congress\u2019s objectives.",

They assert that, to serve the Massachusetts market, they must source compliant pigs and pay a premium to farmers who meet the Act\u2019s confinement standards, which they characterize as a state\u2011imposed preference and discriminatory burden that conflicts with the PSA\u2019s regulatory framework.",
          "On the Privileges and Immunities Clause, plaintiffs contend that the Act targets and regulates out\u2011of\u2011state farming, manufacturing, and production that is lawful in their home states, thereby burdening their protected right to pursue a trade or profession across state lines. They rely on the claimed economic impact and asserted favoritism toward local farmers, arguing that the Clause protects their economic activities from discriminatory treatment by Massachusetts.",

They contend that by effectively penalizing the sale in Massachusetts of products lawfully produced under those states\u2019 laws, Massachusetts is refusing to give full faith and credit to the public acts of sister states.",
          "On the Due Process (vagueness) claim, plaintiffs argue that the Act fails to define adequately what it means for a business owner or operator to \u2018engage in the sale\u2019 of prohibited pork products, leaving unclear whether the term reaches only direct sellers or all participants in the supply chain, such as producers, processors, distributors, and transporters. They also argue that the phrase \u2018turn around freely\u2019 is vague because breeding pigs vary in size and the Act does not specify minimum square footage requirements, making it difficult, in their view, to determine in advance whether particular housing systems comply. They contend that this vagueness fails to give them fair notice and risks arbitrary enforcement.",

They urge a reading of the Clause that would extend its protection to interstate, as well as international, trade.",

          "On the Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals, Massachusetts argues that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(3) expressly states that a court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under Rule 12 or Rule 56. The Commonwealth maintains that the district court did, in substance, consider the complaint, parse the relevant statutory language, and give due consideration to the parties\u2019 arguments, and that there was no procedural requirement for a separate written opinion for each dismissed count.",

It points to plaintiffs\u2019 own reply brief below, in which plaintiffs acknowledged that Massachusetts had requested sua sponte summary judgment, as evidence that they were aware of and responded to this possibility. Massachusetts also notes that discovery had taken place, and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had described \u2018extensive discovery\u2019 on the Pike issues, undermining any claim that they lacked a reasonable opportunity to develop the record.",
          "On the direct discrimination dormant Commerce Clause theory, Massachusetts contends that the Act is facially neutral and applies equally to in\u2011state and out\u2011of\u2011state producers and sellers\u2014no one may sell in Massachusetts whole pork meat derived from pigs confined in a cruel manner, regardless of origin. The state disputes that isolated comments concerning Massachusetts farmers\u2019 existing practices or the effect on out\u2011of\u2011state farms demonstrate a discriminatory purpose to favor local economic interests. It asserts that the Act\u2019s stated, nondiscriminatory purpose is to prevent animal cruelty and protect public health. Regarding discriminatory effect, Massachusetts argues that the fact that no in\u2011state farmer currently uses gestation crates, or that out\u2011of\u2011state producers may bear more of the compliance burden, does not in itself establish discrimination. The Commonwealth invokes Exxon and similar cases to argue that a neutral law does not become discriminatory simply because its impact falls mainly on out\u2011of\u2011state entities, and it contends that plaintiffs have not produced significantly probative evidence of any comparative competitive advantage conferred upon Massachusetts producers.",
          "On the Pike dormant Commerce Clause claim, Massachusetts argues that National Pork Producers Council v. Ross is controlling and confirms that the kind of burdens alleged by plaintiffs\u2014higher production costs, supply chain adjustments, and changes to favored methods of operation\u2014do not amount to a substantial burden on interstate commerce of the type required for Pike balancing. Massachusetts emphasizes that the Act regulates evenhandedly within its borders, is directed at animal welfare and consumer protection, and that judges are institutionally ill\u2011suited to compare alleged economic burdens on multistate producers with the noneconomic benefits of improved animal welfare. It maintains that, under National Pork and related cases, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fall outside the \u2018heartland\u2019 of Pike claims.",
          "On FMIA preemption, Massachusetts argues that the Act regulates pork production practices and the in\u2011state sale of pork products, not the \u2018premises, facilities, and operations\u2019 of federally inspected slaughterhouses that are within the FMIA\u2019s preemptive scope. The Commonwealth distinguishes National Meat Ass\u2019n v. Harris by noting that the California statute there directly regulated how slaughterhouses handled nonambulatory animals and effectively overrode the federal regime for determining whether such animals could be slaughtered or their meat sold. In contrast, Massachusetts maintains that its Act simply bans the sale of products from animals confined in a certain manner, \u2018beyond the slaughterhouse gate,\u2019 and does not dictate how slaughterhouses inspected under the FMIA must operate or what they may process. It argues that the Act does not create a new federally preempted category of \u2018adulterated\u2019 meat but instead falls within state authority to regulate products sold within its borders.",
          "On PSA preemption, Massachusetts argues that the Act does not require packers or wholesalers to give any preference or disadvantage based on geographic location or other criteria covered by the PSA. Rather, it prohibits the sale, in Massachusetts, of non\u2011compliant pork regardless of origin. According to the Commonwealth, any market adjustments or pricing changes that result from producers choosing to supply compliant product do not amount to a conflict with the PSA\u2019s prohibition on undue preferences or discrimination, and there is no impossibility of dual compliance or obstacle to the PSA\u2019s purposes.",
          "On the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Massachusetts argues that the Clause protects only natural persons (citizens), not corporations, LLCs, LLPs, or cooperatives. It points out that plaintiffs describe themselves as a farmer\u2011owned company and entities such as LLCs, an LLP, a corporation, and a cooperative, not individual citizens. Thus, in the Commonwealth\u2019s view, plaintiffs lack a proper basis to assert a Privileges and Immunities claim.",
          "On the Full Faith and Credit issue, Massachusetts contends that its Act does not invalidate or prevent enforcement of other states\u2019 Right to Farm laws but simply regulates what products may be sold within Massachusetts. Out\u2011of\u2011state farmers remain free to use the confinement practices allowed by their own states\u2019 laws; they are only restricted from selling certain resulting products in Massachusetts. The Commonwealth asserts that this is a permissible application of its own policy to conduct within its borders and does not reflect any policy of hostility toward sister states\u2019 laws.",
          "On the Due Process (vagueness) claim, Massachusetts argues that the Act\u2019s definitions provide sufficient clarity. It notes that \u2018sale\u2019 is defined as \u2018a commercial sale by a business\u2019 covered by the Act, and that a sale is deemed to occur where the buyer takes physical possession, which it contends gives ordinary businesses clear notice that the prohibition applies to those who commercially sell covered products in Massachusetts, not to every participant in the upstream supply chain. It further points out that \u2018turn around freely\u2019 is explicitly defined in the statute as turning in a complete circle without impediment and without touching the enclosure or another animal, and argues that this definition is sufficiently precise that producers can understand and comply with it even without specific square footage requirements.",
          "On the Import-Export Clause, Massachusetts argues that longstanding Supreme Court precedent holds that the Clause applies only to international imports and exports, not to goods moving between states. Therefore, even if the Act imposes conditions on interstate goods sold in Massachusetts, it does not implicate the Import-Export Clause\u2019s prohibition on state imposts or duties on imports or exports.",
          "Overall, Massachusetts maintains that the Act is a neutral, evenhanded regulation of products sold within Massachusetts, designed to prevent animal cruelty and protect public health, that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce, and that is not preempted or invalid under the various constitutional provisions and federal statutes invoked by plaintiffs."

On the merits, the Act is facially neutral and applies identically to in\u2011state and out\u2011of\u2011state pork. That no Massachusetts pig farmers used gestation crates does not, under Exxon and similar cases, convert a neutral law into one that discriminates in purpose or effect. The legislative history statements cited by plaintiffs primarily concern animal welfare and public health; the record does not show a protectionist design to favor in\u2011state economic interests. Nor have plaintiffs adduced significantly probative evidence that similarly situated in\u2011state producers receive a competitive advantage; if anything, there are virtually no in\u2011state producers to benefit.

Here, as in Ross, the law regulates evenhandedly, is aimed at animal welfare and related local interests, and any extraterritorial effects flow from producers\u2019 voluntary choices about which markets to serve. Plaintiffs have not shown the kind of market\u2011balkanization, denial of access, or structural disruption to the interstate market that sits within Pike\u2019s \u201cheartland.\u201d Given that threshold failure, there is no basis to proceed to balancing, and the Act survives Pike review."

Possession of a loaded firearm outside the home or place of business is otherwise criminalized, \u00a7 265.03(3), with license-holders exempted from criminal liability, \u00a7 265.20(a)(3). Licensing is administered at the city and county level, \u00a7 400.00(3). Localities can adopt more restrictive licensing requirements than the State, \u00a7 400.30. As relevant here, state law provides that, with limited exceptions, individuals who wish to carry firearms in New York City must obtain either (a) a license issued by the City or (b) a special City-issued permit if they already hold a license from another jurisdiction in the State, \u00a7 400.00(6).\n\nBefore July 2022, New York required applicants for a concealed carry license to show \"proper cause\" to obtain an unrestricted public-carry license. That requirement was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Bruen. In response, the New York Legislature enacted the Concealed Carry Improvement Act (CCIA). The CCIA removed the proper-cause requirement and amended other aspects of the State\u2019s firearm regulatory scheme. As relevant here, the CCIA created a new offense making it a felony for even licensed concealed-carry holders to possess firearms in designated \"sensitive locations,\" including (1) \"the area commonly known as Times Square\" and (2) \"any place, conveyance, or vehicle used for public transportation or public transit\" and any facility used for transportation of passengers (which includes the New York City subway and Metro-North rail systems). See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.01-e(2)(n), (2)(t); N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 10-315 (defining the Times Square area). The statute includes exemptions for certain categories of persons, such as law enforcement officers, active-duty military personnel, and security guards. The CCIA did not modify the existing statewide ban on open carry or the City\u2019s special permit requirement.\n\nJason Frey is a New York resident holding a restricted \"sportsman\" concealed-carry license issued by Westchester County. That license authorizes him to carry concealed handguns between his home and target shooting activities, and during activities like camping, hiking, and hunting. In 2019, Westchester County denied his application for an unrestricted concealed carry license on the basis that he did not show proper cause. Frey does not have a special permit from New York City to carry concealed within City limits and has stated that he is not going to, and believes he should not have to, apply separately to the City. Frey avers that, despite the limitations on his sportsman license and the lack of a City permit, he regularly carries his handgun concealed outside the scope of his license in Westchester County and in New York City, including on Metro-North trains into Grand Central Terminal, on the New York City subway, and in Times Square. He further states he intends to begin openly carrying his handgun, holstered, when he is not carrying it concealed, and that the only reason he does not open carry in New York State is his fear of arrest, incarceration, and associated criminal and civil penalties.\n\nWilliam Sappe holds an \"unrestricted\" concealed-carry license issued in Orange County, New York. At some unspecified time he applied for and was denied a special permit to carry in New York City. Sappe is licensed by the State as an armed guard. In that capacity he regularly transports cash, diamonds, and jewelry into and out of New York City\u2019s Diamond District, which requires travel through Times Square. He states that he intends to carry his handgun concealed in New York City for self-defense on a daily basis, and that he intends to begin carrying his handgun openly and exposed, on days when he is not carrying concealed, both inside New York City and throughout the State. He asserts that he refrains from doing so because of fear of arrest and incarceration for carrying in the City without the special permit and for open carrying in violation of New York\u2019s open carry prohibition.\n\nBrianna Frey is also a plaintiff but, as explained in the procedural history, she did not ultimately participate in the preliminary injunction issues relevant to this appeal. Plaintiff Jack Cheng likewise did not join the preliminary injunction motion that is the subject of this appeal.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"The plaintiffs filed this federal lawsuit in 2021 challenging various aspects of New York\u2019s firearm regulatory scheme under the Second Amendment, including the then-existing \"proper cause\" requirement. After the CCIA took effect in 2022, they filed an operative second amended complaint in October 2022, naming the City of New York, the then-Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, and the then-Acting Superintendent of the New York State Police as defendants. As relevant to this appeal, the second amended complaint asserted pre-enforcement Second Amendment challenges to: (1) the CCIA\u2019s \"sensitive locations\" provisions in N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.01-e, as applied to Times Square and to public transportation systems used by the New York City subway and Metro-North rail lines; (2) New York\u2019s effective statewide ban on open carry, based on N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 400.00(15), 265.01, 265.01-b, 265.03(3) and N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 10-315, which plaintiffs alleged collectively prohibit the open public carriage of firearms; and (3) the New York City\u2013specific special permit requirement in N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 400.00(6), which makes a state-issued carry license invalid within New York City unless the City\u2019s Police Commissioner issues a special permit granting validity within the City. The challenges were brought on a pre-enforcement basis: plaintiffs alleged they intended to engage in conduct (concealed and open carry in specified locations, including New York City, Times Square, and transit systems) that would be criminalized by these provisions and that they refrained or limited their conduct out of fear of prosecution.",
        "district_court_decision":"On October 20, 2022, the plaintiffs filed in the Southern District of New York an application styled as a proposed order to show cause seeking emergency relief, which the district court construed as a motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the challenged provisions. In Frey v. Nigrelli, 661 F. Supp. 3d 176 (S.D.N.Y. 2023), the district court denied the motion in an order dated March 13, 2023. The court: (1) addressed the Second Amendment claims under the then-applicable Bruen framework; (2) as to the CCIA \"sensitive locations\" provisions covering Times Square and public transportation, found on the preliminary record that the government had sufficiently shown a historical tradition of banning firearms in congested commercial or public areas (including crowded public forums and transportation-like contexts) to justify those restrictions at the preliminary stage; (3) held that plaintiffs lacked standing to seek a preliminary injunction against New York\u2019s open carry ban (principally \u00a7 400.00(15) and related provisions) because, in the court\u2019s view, plaintiffs had not pleaded sufficiently concrete and imminent plans to carry firearms openly and thus had not demonstrated an actual or imminent injury for pre-enforcement standing; and alternatively concluded that, even if standing existed, plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on the merits because the open carry ban fit within a historical tradition of regulating the manner of public carry by allowing the state to prohibit one mode (open or concealed) while leaving the other available; (4) denied preliminary relief against the City\u2019s special permit requirement (\u00a7 400.00(6)), finding that the government had shown a longstanding historical practice of municipal- and town-level firearm regulations and concluding that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to that permit structure. The district court also stayed, and did not decide on the merits, plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to the CCIA\u2019s prohibition on carrying firearms on private property without the owner\u2019s permission (\u00a7 265.01-d) and on carrying firearms in other designated sensitive locations (including public parks, theaters, and restaurants serving alcohol), pending resolution of similar issues in related Second Circuit cases (including Antonyuk v. James). Those stayed provisions are not part of this appeal.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Plaintiffs Jason Frey and William Sappe, as Plaintiffs-Appellants, appealed the district court\u2019s March 13, 2023 order denying their motion for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, they contest the denial of preliminary injunctive relief with respect to (1) the CCIA\u2019s \"sensitive locations\" firearm prohibitions as applied to Times Square and to the New York City subway and Metro-North rail systems (N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.01-e(2)(t), (2)(n)); (2) the statewide ban on open carry, focusing on N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 400.00(15) (with any challenges to \u00a7\u00a7 265.01, 265.01-b, 265.03(3), and N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 10-315 effectively abandoned or resolved against them in the district court and not pursued on appeal); and (3) the New York City special permit requirement for carrying a firearm within City limits (N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 400.00(6)). Jack Cheng did not join the preliminary injunction motion and is not a party to the appeal as to that relief. The district court had held that plaintiff Brianna Frey lacked standing as to the provisions at issue, and that determination is not contested on appeal; thus the appeal focuses on the claims of Jason Frey and William Sappe."

For a plaintiff seeking to preliminarily enjoin such a regime, particularly when challenging it facially and pre-enforcement, the plaintiff must first overcome the presumption of constitutionality by identifying concrete features of the regime that allegedly impose unconstitutional burdens (such as discretionary issuance, abusive administration, lengthy processing times, or exorbitant fees), and must then satisfy the Bruen two-step test by showing that the plain text covers the conduct and by contesting the government\u2019s showing of consistency with historical tradition.

          "Sensitive locations \u2013 Times Square and transit: Plaintiffs argue that the CCIA\u2019s designation of Times Square and public transportation systems (including the New York City subway and Metro-North rail) as \"sensitive locations\" where even licensed carriers may not bring firearms violates the Second Amendment. They contend that Bruen recognizes only certain well-established sensitive places, such as schools and government buildings, and that extending the concept to large urban commercial districts and transportation systems impermissibly expands the \"sensitive place\" category. Plaintiffs maintain that there is no distinctly similar historical tradition of banning firearms in areas like Times Square or transit systems open to the general public, and that historical statutes cited by the government (e.g., relating to fairs, markets, or certain public assemblies) are not sufficiently analogous. They emphasize that the absence of specific Founding-era laws regulating firearms on public transportation or in broad commercial districts demonstrates that such modern broad bans lack historical support.",
          "Open carry ban \u2013 standing and merits: On standing, plaintiffs argue that they have adequately alleged injury in fact and a credible threat of enforcement. They rely on sworn statements that they intend to carry handguns openly in New York (including in and outside New York City) and that they refrain solely due to fear of arrest, incarceration, and other penalties under \u00a7 400.00(15) and related provisions. They contend that Supreme Court precedent on pre-enforcement challenges does not require them to specify exact dates, times, or locations for future violations; rather, an intention to engage in constitutionally protected conduct, deterred by a credible threat of prosecution, suffices. On the merits, plaintiffs assert that the Second Amendment protects not just the right to bear arms in some manner, but also encompasses the choice of mode of carriage. They argue that a total ban on open carry, even where concealed carry is permitted, infringes the right \"to bear\" arms, and that Bruen and other historical evidence do not support bans on one entire mode of public carry. They contend that historical regulations of concealed carry cited by the government do not justify a modern, opposite approach that bans open carry while allowing only concealed carry, and that any analogy to those historical laws is inapt.",
          "City special permit requirement: Plaintiffs contend that New York City\u2019s special permit requirement violates the Second Amendment because it conditions the exercise of the right to carry for self-defense within the City on an additional, separate licensing process, even for individuals who already hold a valid state concealed-carry license. They maintain that, having obtained state licenses issued under state standards, they should be able to carry throughout the State, including in New York City, without having to apply for a City-specific permit. They suggest that requiring a separate City permit imposes an unconstitutional burden on the right to bear arms by subjecting license holders to duplicative procedures and effectively denying or delaying exercise of the right within City limits. Plaintiffs also argue that administration of licensing at the municipal level, rather than exclusively at the state level, raises constitutional concerns and assert that the historical record does not justify a model in which cities can impose additional permit requirements on top of state licensing schemes. They characterize their challenge as a facial attack on \u00a7 400.00(6), arguing that the requirement is unconstitutional in its fundamental structure, even apart from specific application details like fees, timelines, or discretionary criteria.",
          "Historical tradition and temporal focus: Across all issues, plaintiffs argue that the court\u2019s historical inquiry should focus primarily or exclusively on Founding-era (circa 1791) understandings, rather than Reconstruction-era or later evidence. They assert that reliance on \"late-nineteenth-century\" or early-twentieth-century statutes, particularly those from Western territories or post\u2013Civil War jurisdictions, is improper or entitled to diminished weight and cannot establish a binding national tradition that would justify modern restrictions like those in the CCIA or the City\u2019s special permit requirement."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "Sensitive locations \u2013 Times Square and transit: The State and City argue that the CCIA\u2019s prohibitions on carrying firearms in Times Square and on public transportation systems comport with a long historical tradition of restricting firearms in crowded, public venues to preserve order and public safety. They rely on historical regulations from medieval England (such as the Statute of Northampton) and Founding-era and Reconstruction-era American statutes barring weapons in fairs, markets, public assemblies, places of entertainment, and other crowded venues, as well as judicial decisions upholding those statutes. They characterize Times Square as a modern analogue to historical fairs, markets, and town squares\u2014densely crowded with residents and visitors, heavily commercial, and frequently the site of public events and demonstrations. They describe the New York City subway and Metro-North as modern analogues of crowded enclosed public venues historically regulated, such as ballrooms or other spaces where people are assembled, emphasizing the confined conditions on trains and platforms where large numbers of people are in close proximity. The government contends that the CCIA\u2019s sensitive-location provisions burden the right in a manner and for reasons (crowd safety and prevention of violence and panic) that are consistent with these historical analogues, and that the lack of specific Founding-era laws regulating public mass transit is explained by the absence of such systems at the time, not by a constitutional bar on such regulations.",
          "Open carry ban \u2013 standing and merits: On standing, the City initially argued that plaintiffs failed to establish imminent injury because their affidavits did not specify concrete, time-bound plans to openly carry firearms in violation of state law and therefore did not demonstrate a certainly impending prosecution. The City also argued that even if \u00a7 400.00(15) were enjoined, other provisions (such as \u00a7 400.00(2)(f), governing license conditions, and the City special permit rule) would still prevent or penalize plaintiffs\u2019 open carry, undermining redressability. On the merits, the State and City argue that New York\u2019s prohibition on open carry is consistent with a longstanding historical tradition of regulating the \"manner\" in which arms may be carried in public. Citing Bruen, Heller, and 19th-century statutes and cases, they assert that many states historically prohibited either concealed carry or open carry, while leaving the alternative mode of carry lawful, and that courts repeatedly upheld such laws as compatible with the right to bear arms. They argue that this tradition supports New York\u2019s modern choice to prohibit open carry while allowing licensed concealed carry and that the Second Amendment does not guarantee an unfettered choice of carry mode. They emphasize that so long as some practical means of public carry for self-defense remains available to law-abiding citizens (here, licensed concealed carry), eliminating one mode\u2014open carry\u2014does not violate the Second Amendment under historical standards.",
          "City special permit requirement: The government argues that New York City\u2019s special permit requirement in \u00a7 400.00(6) is part of a presumptively lawful \"shall-issue\" licensing regime of the type expressly left intact by Bruen, because it is aimed at ensuring that those bearing arms in the City are law-abiding and responsible citizens. They contend that plaintiffs have not identified any feature of the City\u2019s licensing system\u2014such as discretionary standards, abusive administration, excessive delays, or exorbitant fees\u2014that would transform it into a de facto ban or otherwise render it unconstitutional. From the government\u2019s perspective, the added requirement that someone who wishes to carry in New York City must obtain a City-issued permit is, at most, an incremental administrative step that does not materially burden the right to carry. They further argue that plaintiffs are bringing a facial pre-enforcement challenge and that to succeed they would have to show that the statute is unconstitutional in all its applications, which they have not done. Historically, the State and City cite numerous antebellum and Reconstruction-era statutes and municipal ordinances granting towns and cities authority to regulate gunpowder storage, the discharge and carrying of firearms, and, in many instances, to require local permits for carrying within city limits or to ban the carrying of weapons in urban areas altogether. They rely on these examples to show a longstanding tradition of allowing urban areas to adopt stricter firearm regulations than rural areas, and specifically to impose city-level permitting requirements. They therefore argue that New York City\u2019s special permit requirement is consistent with this tradition and that municipal administration of firearm permitting is historically grounded and constitutionally permissible.",
          "Historical era and evidentiary scope: Across the issues, the government argues that courts may and should consider historical evidence not only from the Founding era but also from the Reconstruction era and later 19th century when determining the Nation\u2019s tradition of firearm regulation, especially where Founding-era evidence is sparse or indeterminate. They rely on Supreme Court precedent indicating that post-Founding history can \"liquidate\" or clarify constitutional meaning and demonstrate a longstanding practice, and argue that the weight of 19th-century statutes and judicial decisions supports the challenged modern regulations."

Applying Bruen at the likelihood-of-success stage, the district court relied on a substantial body of historical regulations of weapons in crowded markets, fairs, public assemblies, and similar venues, and treated Times Square and mass transit as modern analogues justified by the same public-safety rationales. Post\u2011Bruen Second Circuit decisions in related CCIA litigation have generally accepted that at least some of these sensitive\u2011place designations can be supported by historical analogues, and they have emphasized the deferential posture on preliminary relief. Given that (a) the plaintiffs bear the burden of showing a clear or substantial likelihood of success, (b) the government produced non\u2011frivolous historical analogues, and (c) there is no clear controlling precedent holding Times Square or public transit designations unconstitutional, the district court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits falls comfortably within the range of permissible outcomes.

          "reasoning":"Standing is reviewed de novo. The plaintiffs assert an intent to openly carry at some point in the future and a general deterrence based on fear of prosecution, but their declarations lack concrete plans\u2014no specific timeframe, pattern of conduct, or particularized circumstances beyond an abstract statement of intention. Following Supreme Court and Second Circuit pre\u2011enforcement standing doctrine, courts typically require more than a generalized desire to violate the law someday. The district court reasonably viewed this as insufficiently imminent to constitute a certainly impending or substantially likely injury, and that legal conclusion is likely to be affirmed. Even if the appellate panel were to find standing based on a credible threat of enforcement, the district court alternatively found that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits because a categorical ban on one mode of carry (here, open carry) while leaving another (licensed concealed carry) available is consistent with a well\u2011documented historical tradition of manner\u2011of\u2011carry regulation. Bruen itself cites 19th\u2011century decisions and statutes upholding prohibitions on concealed carry where open carry remained lawful; the same logic supports a jurisdiction\u2019s choice to invert the regime, so long as some practical means of public carry exists. Given that the plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction and must show a clear or substantial likelihood of success, the historical record invoked by the State and City is sufficient to sustain the district court\u2019s merits assessment under an abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion standard.

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"The denial of a preliminary injunction against the City\u2011specific permit requirement is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Bruen recognizes the presumptive constitutionality of shall\u2011issue licensing schemes using objective criteria, provided they are not administered to frustrate the right in practice. The plaintiffs mount a facial, pre\u2011enforcement challenge but identify no concrete features\u2014such as discretionary standards, excessive fees, systemic delays, or denial patterns\u2014showing that New York City\u2019s special\u2011permit system is effectively a discretionary or prohibitory regime. Instead, they challenge the very fact of a separate municipal permit layered atop a state license. Historical materials, however, reflect a longstanding practice of municipalities imposing stricter carry rules or additional permitting in urban areas, and of local administration of weapons regulations. That historical tradition supports treating a city\u2011specific permit as a permissible, objective condition on public carry in a dense urban center. Facially, there are plainly constitutional applications of \u00a7 400.00(6) (e.g., to applicants who readily satisfy the objective criteria and receive permits). On this record, plaintiffs have not overcome Bruen\u2019s presumption in favor of shall\u2011issue schemes or shown a clear likelihood of success on a facial Second Amendment challenge. The district court\u2019s reliance on historical examples of local gun regulation and its characterization of the New York City permit as an incremental administrative step, rather than a de facto ban, is within the realm of permissible adjudication at the preliminary\u2011injunction stage. Therefore, the denial of preliminary injunctive relief is likely to be affirmed."

      "reasoning":"The appeal concerns only the interlocutory denial of a preliminary injunction. Under the abuse\u2011of\u2011discretion standard, the appellants must show either a clear legal error in the district court\u2019s application of Bruen or findings so implausible as to be clearly erroneous, and in addition must establish a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their Second Amendment claims. The State and City presented substantial historical support for (1) designating crowded urban hubs and enclosed mass\u2011transit systems as sensitive places, and (2) regulating the manner of public carry by prohibiting one mode (open carry) while allowing another (licensed concealed carry). They also invoked a robust historical tradition of municipal firearms regulation and permitting, which undercuts a facial attack on the City\u2011specific permit requirement. In the pre\u2011enforcement standing context, the plaintiffs\u2019 generalized future intent to openly carry, without concrete, imminent plans, is vulnerable under Article III precedents, justifying the district court\u2019s standing ruling. Even if standing were found, the plaintiffs have not, at this preliminary stage, rebutted the government\u2019s historical showing to the degree necessary for the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction. Given existing Supreme Court and Second Circuit guidance on shall\u2011issue licensing schemes and manner\u2011of\u2011carry regulations, the district court\u2019s denial of preliminary relief on all three issues falls squarely within the acceptable range of outcomes.

Until recently, sludge and septage were often used throughout Maine as soil additives at agricultural sites and in commercial products. Maine alleges that land application of sludge and septage has greatly expanded the area of PFAS contamination. As an example, it alleges that private drinking water wells in Fairfield, near fields fertilized with sludge, have PFAS levels hundreds or more than 1,000 times higher than Maine\u2019s 20 parts-per-trillion interim drinking water standard. In response to this issue, the Maine Legislature required the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to develop and implement a program to evaluate soil and groundwater for PFAS at locations licensed to apply sludge or septage to land.\n\nMaine further alleges contamination of specific natural resources, including fish in Fish Brook in Fairfield, the Presumpscot River in Westbrook, and Sheepscot Pond in Palermo, and wildlife such as deer. The complaint focuses on contamination by at least eight particular PFAS chemicals (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpA, PFDA, PFBS, and GenX), while reserving the possibility that additional PFAS chemicals may be identified during the litigation as investigation continues.\n\n3M manufactured Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF), a firefighting foam that contains PFAS. Some AFFF was produced to meet U.S. military specifications (\"MilSpec AFFF\") and has been used at military facilities in Maine and elsewhere. Federal regulators, including the Federal Aviation Administration, also required commercial airports certified under 14 C.F.R. Part 139 to use AFFF meeting MilSpec standards beginning in 2006.\n\n3M\u2019s theory is that PFAS contamination from MilSpec AFFF used at military facilities in Maine has plausibly migrated offsite and commingled with PFAS from non\u2011AFFF sources at various locations. In its removal filings, 3M pointed to documents and governmental reports indicating that PFAS from AFFF use at several military installations in Maine, including the former Naval Air Station Brunswick, the Maine Air National Guard Base in Bangor, Loring Air Force Base, and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, have plausibly migrated via groundwater, surface water, and wastewater-related pathways to nearby or downstream locations, including wastewater treatment plants, sludge application sites, municipal landfills, and public water systems. After remand to state court and further discovery, Maine identified 910 specific sites at issue in this non\u2011AFFF lawsuit. Based on Maine\u2019s interrogatory answers and public reports, 3M asserts that at least several of these 910 sites, including the Brunswick\/Topsham Water District (BTWD) system, the Hawk Ridge Compost Facility, the Juniper Ridge Landfill, and portions of the Androscoggin, Aroostook, Little Madawaska, and Penobscot Rivers, are plausibly affected, at least in part, by PFAS originating from MilSpec AFFF used at military facilities, and that contamination from AFFF and non\u2011AFFF sources has commingled at those locations.\n\nMaine, for its part, has submitted a sworn declaration in the remand proceedings (from a DEP official) representing that specific sites identified as part of the non\u2011AFFF litigation show no evidence of AFFF contamination, and it maintains that this lawsuit seeks recovery only for contamination and injury not related to AFFF use. Maine also states that, as to at least one water system (BTWD), that system has separately settled its PFAS claims against 3M as part of a nationwide class action settlement with public water systems, though Maine contends that the evidentiary and legal significance of potential AFFF\u2011related cross\u2011contamination at BTWD remains to be addressed in the district court.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"On March 29, 2023, the State of Maine filed two separate but closely related PFAS lawsuits in Maine state court. One complaint (the \"AFFF Complaint\") seeks to recover for PFAS contamination caused by 3M's production of AFFF. The other complaint (the \"non\u2011AFFF Complaint\" at issue in this appeal) seeks to recover for PFAS contamination allegedly not caused by 3M's production of AFFF. In the non\u2011AFFF Complaint, Maine named 3M and several other corporate defendants (EIDP, Inc.; The Chemours Company; The Chemours Company FC, LLC; DuPont de Nemours, Inc.; Dow Inc.; and Corteva, Inc.) and alleged multiple causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, statutory nuisance, common law trespass, strict liability (for failure to warn and for design defect\/defective product), and negligence, as well as claims for actual and constructive fraudulent transfers against the non\u20113M defendants. Maine sought compensatory damages for loss of use and enjoyment of state natural resources and property, investigation, monitoring, abatement, remediation, prevention, treatment, and removal costs related to PFAS contamination, and punitive damages. The non\u2011AFFF Complaint also alleged contamination by PFAS statewide, and while it listed roughly 22 \"example\" sites allegedly containing only non\u2011AFFF PFAS, it expressly stated that the State was continuing to discover additional sites and that the complete set of locations would be developed in discovery.\n\nIn the non\u2011AFFF Complaint, Maine included a specific disclaimer stating that it was not seeking to recover \"any relief for contamination or injury related to Aqueous Film Forming Foam [\u2018AFFF\u2019 or \u2018MilSpec AFFF\u2019], a firefighting material that contains PFAS\" through that complaint. Maine has taken the position that this disclaimer applies to both MilSpec AFFF and non\u2011MilSpec AFFF and that the non\u2011AFFF case is limited to contamination from other PFAS sources.\n\n3M, in turn, has asserted that PFAS from AFFF use at military and other federally regulated facilities has migrated and commingled with PFAS from non\u2011AFFF sources at many of the locations for which Maine seeks recovery in the non\u2011AFFF case and that this commingling will be a significant factual and legal issue in the litigation.",
        "district_court_decision":"On May 17, 2023, 3M removed the non\u2011AFFF case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine under the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1). 3M argued that it had acted under federal authority in producing MilSpec AFFF for the U.S. military and for uses required by federal agencies; that there was a sufficient connection between its federally directed AFFF\u2011related conduct and the PFAS contamination alleged in the non\u2011AFFF Complaint because PFAS from AFFF use had plausibly commingled with PFAS from other sources at various sites; and that it had a colorable federal defense under the federal contractor doctrine recognized in Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., which it contended would bar or limit tort liability for the design, manufacture, and warnings associated with MilSpec AFFF. Maine did not oppose removal of the separate AFFF case, and that case was removed and transferred to the AFFF multidistrict litigation (MDL No. 2873) in the District of South Carolina as a tag\u2011along action. \n\nMaine did, however, move to remand the non\u2011AFFF case to state court, arguing, among other things, that its express disclaimer in the non\u2011AFFF Complaint of any relief for AFFF\u2011related contamination defeated the existence of a colorable federal defense by 3M under \u00a7 1442(a)(1) and therefore negated federal officer removal jurisdiction. 3M opposed remand and also moved to stay a ruling on the remand motion pending a decision by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) on 3M's motion to transfer the case to the AFFF MDL. In support of remand and in opposition to the stay, Maine submitted a sworn declaration from a DEP official, who reviewed specific sites allegedly at issue in the non\u2011AFFF litigation and stated that there was no evidence of AFFF contamination at those PFAS sites.\n\nOn July 26, 2023, the district court granted Maine\u2019s motion to remand the non\u2011AFFF case to state court and denied 3M\u2019s motion to stay. The district court reasoned, among other things, that Maine\u2019s complaint-level disclaimer meant that Maine had assumed the burden, as part of its affirmative case, to show that the PFAS contamination at issue in the non\u2011AFFF litigation was not attributable to AFFF. The court stated that, on remand, if the factfinder in state court concluded that Maine failed to meet its burden of proving the non\u2011AFFF source of contamination at a given location, 3M would prevail for that location. Based on this reasoning, the court concluded that the federal contractor defense relating to AFFF would not come into play in the non\u2011AFFF case and that 3M therefore lacked a colorable federal defense for purposes of the removal statute. The district court thus remanded the case to the Maine Superior Court for Cumberland County. \n\nAfter remand, discovery continued in state court. On August 12, 2025, Maine served interrogatory answers identifying 910 specific sites at issue in the non\u2011AFFF case, substantially expanding on the roughly 22 example sites initially listed in the complaint. In light of these new details, 3M filed a second notice of removal on September 8, 2025, to preserve its claim to a federal forum based on what it characterized as newly revealed facts from Maine\u2019s discovery responses. This second removal petition asserted that at least one of the newly specified sites\u2014the Brunswick\/Topsham Water District (BTWD) water system\u2014was reported to have PFAS contamination traceable to MilSpec AFFF used at the former Naval Air Station Brunswick. 3M supported this assertion with references to BTWD\u2019s own PFAS investigation materials and an EPA site report stating that PFAS found at the Naval Air Station were used in aircraft firefighting foams historically used by the Navy.\n\nOn September 24, 2025, 3M filed a supplemental removal petition, asserting that further review of discovery had uncovered at least six additional sites among the 910 identified by Maine that were plausibly linked to MilSpec AFFF. 3M alleged that PFAS contamination at the Hawk Ridge Compost Facility and the Juniper Ridge Landfill was plausibly connected to AFFF\u2011related PFAS in water supplied by BTWD, which flows into the Brunswick Sewer District and is converted into sludge that was disposed of at both facilities. For the Androscoggin River, where Maine identified fish fillet as the resource at issue, 3M alleged that the river is partially downstream from the former Naval Air Station Brunswick and that fish traveling up and downstream could have been exposed to PFAS from AFFF used at that base. For the Aroostook and Little Madawaska Rivers, 3M pointed to their location downstream from Loring Air Force Base and alleged that PFAS from AFFF use at Loring plausibly flowed via surrounding brooks and streams into these rivers. For the Penobscot River, 3M alleged that portions of the river lie downstream from the Maine Air National Guard Base in Bangor and that PFAS from AFFF use at that base could plausibly reach the river through adjacent streams.\n\nMaine, in subsequent communications to the appellate court, acknowledged that BTWD had resolved its own PFAS-related claims against 3M through a nationwide class action settlement in the AFFF MDL but maintained that the sufficiency of evidence of AFFF-related cross-contamination at BTWD and the legal significance of that cross-contamination were issues for the district court to address at a later stage. Maine continued to argue that its complaint-level disclaimer limited the case to non\u2011AFFF PFAS contamination.",
        "what_is_appealed":"3M timely appealed the district court\u2019s July 26, 2023 remand order in the non\u2011AFFF case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on August 23, 2023. The denial of the stay motion was not separately appealed. On appeal, 3M challenges the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked a colorable federal defense and, therefore, that federal officer removal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1) was not available. 3M also challenges the district court\u2019s reliance on Maine\u2019s complaint-level disclaimer as a basis for concluding that 3M\u2019s federal contractor defense would play no role in the non\u2011AFFF litigation. The appeal concerns whether the non\u2011AFFF case was properly remanded to state court or instead must remain in federal court under the federal officer removal statute, including in light of 3M\u2019s subsequent removal notices based on discovery identifying additional allegedly commingled sites. The aspect of the case being appealed is thus the district court\u2019s jurisdictional determination and remand order under the federal officer removal statute."

According to 3M, this breadth necessarily encompasses multiple locations where PFAS from MilSpec AFFF, used at military bases and other federally regulated facilities, has migrated and commingled with PFAS from non\u2011AFFF sources.",

          "3M emphasizes that Maine\u2019s own litigation strategy and statements confirm that questions about whether PFAS contamination at a given site is attributable to AFFF are part of the case. Maine has stated that, if it fails to prove that contamination at a particular location comes from a non\u2011AFFF source, it cannot recover for that location. 3M contends that in attempting to show AFFF causation or cross\u2011contamination at specific sites, it will necessarily present its federal contractor defense and that such issues should be addressed in federal court.",
          "3M points to new information disclosed in discovery after remand as strengthening the basis for removal: Maine\u2019s identification of 910 specific sites and evidence that several of these sites (e.g., BTWD, Hawk Ridge Compost Facility, Juniper Ridge Landfill, portions of the Androscoggin, Aroostook, Little Madawaska, and Penobscot Rivers) are plausibly connected to PFAS contamination from MilSpec AFFF used at nearby military installations. It argues this evidence underscores that PFAS contamination from AFFF is not neatly segregated from other PFAS sources, but rather commingled, making Maine\u2019s disclaimer ineffective to prevent the federal contractor defense from arising.",

If it fails to prove this at a particular site, it concedes it cannot recover for that site. Maine contends that, as a result, 3M will not need to rely on a federal contractor defense in this case; instead, 3M can simply argue that Maine has failed to meet its burden of proof as to non\u2011AFFF sources, which is a state\u2011law factual issue.",

Maine asserts that, under the disclaimer doctrine, a sovereign plaintiff is entitled to define the scope of its own claims and thereby forego any recovery that would depend on AFFF-related contamination, even if that means it cannot recover for certain commingled sites.",

Maine points to the DEP declaration describing specific non\u2011AFFF sites and representing that there is no evidence of AFFF contamination at those locations. Maine maintains that any fact questions about whether AFFF was used or whether contamination at particular sites is attributable to AFFF are to be decided by the state court within the limits of the disclaimer and do not create a federal defense that must be adjudicated in federal court.",
          "Maine also argues that the new evidence highlighted by 3M in its second and supplemental removal petitions, such as the alleged role of MilSpec AFFF in BTWD\u2019s contamination, does not alter the legal analysis. Maine notes that BTWD itself has settled its claims against 3M in the AFFF MDL and contends that the significance of any BTWD\u2011related AFFF contamination to the non\u2011AFFF case is a matter for the district court to evaluate, not a basis for federal officer jurisdiction. Maine cautions against \"assumptions\" about cross\u2011contamination and emphasizes that whether any particular site is affected by AFFF, and thus outside the scope of the non\u2011AFFF case, is a merits question.",
          "Maine relies on out-of-circuit cases, such as People ex rel. Raoul v. 3M Co. and California ex rel. Harrison v.

Maine argues that, consistent with these authorities, its disclaimer and burden\u2011shifting approach fully insulate this non\u2011AFFF case from MilSpec AFFF\u2011related federal defenses."

Electric Boat has read that standard broadly and rejected a strict causal\u2011link requirement. 3M\u2019s theory, which must be credited at this stage, is that PFAS from MilSpec AFFF used at military installations migrated via groundwater, surface water, wastewater, and sludge into some of the same rivers, landfills, composting facilities, and water systems for which Maine seeks damages in this statewide non\u2011AFFF case, and that contamination from AFFF and non\u2011AFFF sources has commingled at those locations. That alleged overlap means at least some of Maine\u2019s claimed injuries are \u201crelated to\u201d 3M\u2019s federally directed AFFF conduct.

Federal\u2011officer removal jurisprudence (Mesa, Acker, Willingham, Express Scripts, Moore) makes clear that at the removal stage, the court does not resolve who will ultimately bear what burden of proof or whether a federal defense will succeed. The inquiry is whether the defendant has articulated a plausible theory under which a federal defense will be implicated and whether the alleged conduct under color of federal office bears a relation to the charged conduct. The district court reasoned that because Maine had taken on the burden of proving non\u2011AFFF sources, 3M could simply argue failure of proof and would never need to assert Boyle, so no colorable federal defense existed. That approach effectively requires 3M to show, at the threshold, that it must and will prevail on the federal defense before gaining access to a federal forum, contrary to the low \u201ccolorable\u201d threshold. It also assumes away the factual possibility that evidence of AFFF\u2011related commingling will cause 3M to invoke Boyle in defending against liability at various sites. Under the governing precedents and the statute\u2019s directive to be construed broadly, that was error. The First Circuit is likely to hold that reliance on this burden\u2011shifting rationale to deny removal was improper and to reverse."

      "reasoning":"All four issues go to the core \u00a7 1442(a)(1) jurisdictional analysis and are reviewed de novo. The undisputed record shows that 3M acted under federal authority in manufacturing MilSpec AFFF. 3M has advanced a non\u2011frivolous federal\u2011contractor defense applicable whenever MilSpec AFFF is alleged to be a source of contamination. Its theory that PFAS from MilSpec AFFF has migrated from military installations and federally regulated airports into some of the same waters, landfills, and other sites for which Maine seeks broad statewide relief is plausible and must be credited at this stage. Under the post\u20112011 \u201cfor or relating to\u201d standard, that is enough for nexus. The district court\u2019s contrary conclusion rested almost entirely on Maine\u2019s complaint\u2011level disclaimer and on its acceptance of a burden\u2011shifting framework under which Maine promises not to seek recovery for AFFF\u2011related contamination. Under Government of Puerto Rico v. Express Scripts, however, only disclaimers that clearly carve out all claims linked to federally directed conduct\u2014typically by time, location, or factual basis\u2014can defeat removal. Maine\u2019s general renunciation of \u201ccontamination or injury related to AFFF\u201d does not specify excluded sites or timeframes and does not eliminate the need to determine, as a factual matter, whether the contamination at particular locations is tied to MilSpec AFFF, especially in a commingling scenario. That kind of disclaimer is artful pleading and cannot be used to force a federal contractor to litigate the existence and scope of its federal defenses in state court. Moreover, the district court improperly premised its jurisdictional ruling on its merits\u2011stage view of who bears the proof burden regarding AFFF versus non\u2011AFFF sources, contrary to Mesa, Acker, and Moore, which require only a colorable defense and a related\u2011to nexus, not a showing that the defense will be necessary or successful. In light of the statute\u2019s broad construction and First Circuit precedent, the appellate court is likely to hold that 3M has met the federal\u2011officer removal requirements and that the remand order was erroneous. The appropriate overall outcome is reversal of the remand order, with instructions that the non\u2011AFFF action remain in federal court (subject to whatever further case\u2011management decisions, including potential MDL transfer, may follow)."

Arias alleges that during the course of this arrest, certain DEA agents used excessive physical force against him, causing him physical and emotional harm. He further alleges that other DEA agents who were present failed to intervene to prevent the excessive use of force, despite having an opportunity to do so. Arias contends that these actions violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable seizures, specifically excessive force used in making an arrest. The agents were engaged in narcotics law enforcement activities, investigating alleged federal drug law violations, at the time of the arrest.",

Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics. He asserted Fourth Amendment claims for (1) use of excessive force by some of the agents during his September 2016 arrest, and (2) failure to intervene by other agents to prevent the alleged excessive force.",
        "district_court_decision":"The defendants moved for summary judgment, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s then-recent Bivens decision in Egbert v. Boule. The district court analyzed Arias\u2019s excessive force claims separately from his failure-to-intervene claims. As to the excessive force claims, the court recognized that, aside from statutory developments, the case shared many similarities with Bivens: a routine narcotics-related arrest by federal narcotics agents, involving alleged excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and the same general category of defendants (federal narcotics enforcement agents, with DEA as the successor to the former Federal Bureau of Narcotics). The court rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments that the presence of an arrest warrant and the public, parking-lot setting made the context meaningfully different from Bivens, and concluded that those distinctions were not significant. However, the district court determined that a 1988 amendment to the Inspector General Act (IGA), which extended the statute to the Department of Justice and established an administrative mechanism for filing misconduct complaints with the DOJ Office of Inspector General, created an \"alternative remedial scheme\" that had not existed at the time of Bivens. The court concluded that, under Egbert and related precedent, the existence of this alternative remedial structure both (a) rendered Arias\u2019s excessive force claims a \"new context\" compared to Bivens, and (b) was a \"special factor\" counseling against extending Bivens to that context. On that basis, the court held that Arias could not pursue a Bivens damages remedy on his excessive force claims. As to the failure-to-intervene claims, the district court reasoned that Bivens did not involve any theory of bystander liability or failure to intervene, and therefore those claims arose in a new context. The court further concluded that, as with the excessive force claims, the availability of the IGA\u2019s administrative complaint process was a sufficient alternative remedial scheme that both made the context new and counseled against recognizing a Bivens remedy. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all of Arias\u2019s Bivens claims.",

On appeal, he challenges the ruling that his Fourth Amendment excessive force claims cannot proceed under Bivens, specifically disputing the conclusion that the Inspector General Act\u2019s administrative complaint process renders his claims a new context and forecloses a Bivens damages remedy. As to the failure-to-intervene claims, the district court\u2019s judgment rests additionally on the conclusion that such bystander-liability claims arise in a new context not present in Bivens; Arias does not develop arguments on appeal contesting this independent basis."

          "He argues that the presence of an arrest warrant does not constitute a meaningful difference, because a warrant authorizes an arrest but does not authorize or justify the use of excessive force. Thus, the legal mandate under which the agents operated with respect to the amount of permissible force was the same as in Bivens, and the Fourth Amendment excessive force standard and judicial guidance governing such force are at least as well developed now as when Bivens was decided.",
          "He further argues that the public, shopping-center parking lot location of the arrest is not a meaningful difference for Bivens purposes, because the core claim concerns the degree of physical force used against his person, not an intrusion on the privacy of a home or other distinct Fourth Amendment interests. In his view, excessive force during an arrest in a parking lot presents no materially different separation-of-powers concerns from those implicated by excessive force during an arrest in a residence.",
          "With respect to the Inspector General Act, Arias maintains that the mere existence of an administrative complaint mechanism for reporting federal law enforcement misconduct should not, by itself, create a new Bivens context or bar the use of the existing Bivens cause of action.

          "The DEA agents argue that under Egbert, Arias\u2019s excessive force and failure-to-intervene claims present a new Bivens context because they differ in several respects from Bivens: the arrest here was conducted pursuant to a warrant; it occurred in a publicly accessible shopping center parking lot rather than inside a private home; and Arias includes a failure-to-intervene theory, which was not present in Bivens and involves a different type of alleged misconduct (bystander liability) and a different legal theory.",
          "They contend that, at the first step of the Egbert\/Abbasi analysis, the presence of an arrest warrant is a meaningful difference because the officers were acting under a judicially authorized mandate based on a probable cause determination by a neutral magistrate, which changes the legal context for the officers\u2019 actions and differentiates this case from the warrantless home entry and arrest in Bivens.",
          "They further argue that the arrest\u2019s public location in a busy parking lot, with associated risks to bystanders and public safety, also meaningfully distinguishes the case from Bivens, where the arrest occurred in the privacy of a home, implicating different Fourth Amendment concerns and policy considerations regarding officer conduct and the use of force.",
          "As to step two, the agents argue that there are special factors counseling hesitation against extending Bivens to these claims, particularly the existence of alternative remedial structures. They point to the Inspector General Act\u2019s administrative process, through which individuals can file misconduct complaints with the DOJ Office of the Inspector General for investigation and potential administrative or disciplinary action, as an alternative mechanism for addressing alleged misconduct by federal law enforcement officers.",

The core factual and legal context of his claim\u2014line\u2011level federal narcotics agents allegedly using excessive force while executing a routine narcotics arrest\u2014tracks Bivens itself: same constitutional provision (Fourth Amendment), same type of defendant (federal narcotics officers; DEA as successor to the FBN), same law\u2011enforcement setting (ordinary drug enforcement), and the same theory of direct excessive force. The differences the government presses (presence of an arrest warrant and the public parking\u2011lot location) are unlikely to be treated as \u201cmeaningful\u201d for Abbasi\/Egbert purposes, because they do not materially change the nature of the alleged constitutional violation (unreasonable force in seizing a person) or implicate new separation\u2011of\u2011powers concerns. Most circuits considering similar post\u2011Egbert claims have treated traditional law\u2011enforcement excessive\u2011force claims as within Bivens\u2019s original context rather than a \u201cnew\u201d one. \n\nThe district court\u2019s key move\u2014treating the Inspector General Act\u2019s complaint mechanism as itself creating a new context and as a special factor that extinguishes even Bivens\u2011type claims\u2014overreads Egbert. Egbert did not hold that later\u2011enacted internal or administrative complaint channels retroactively convert classic Bivens claims into \u201cnew context\u201d claims; rather, it instructed courts not to extend Bivens into *new* contexts where Congress has provided other remedial structures. Here, the court effectively nullified Bivens in its core domain by reasoning that the mere existence of the DOJ\u2011OIG complaint process (and similar post\u2011Bivens legislation) is enough both to make the context new and to bar a damages remedy. That conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated statements that Bivens remains viable, albeit narrow, in its original setting. Because Arias\u2019s excessive\u2011force claim stays within that original setting, the IGA\u2019s administrative mechanism cannot be used to deny a remedy in what is not a new context. The appellate court is likely to hold that these excessive\u2011force claims do *not* arise in a new context and therefore that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on that ground, and to remand for further proceedings on the merits and qualified immunity."

Under ordinary principles of appellate review, that constitutes forfeiture or waiver of the issue, and the appellate court can affirm on that basis alone without needing to re\u2011run the full Egbert\/Abbasi analysis. The panel will therefore treat the district court\u2019s alternative ground\u2014that such bystander\u2011liability claims are a new context and, in light of alternative remedial structures, no Bivens remedy should be recognized\u2014as unchallenged and leave the judgment intact as to those claims."

Post\u2011Egbert decisions show strong reluctance to expand Bivens but also indicate that courts generally distinguish between refusing to extend Bivens to genuinely new contexts and gutting Bivens in its original law\u2011enforcement setting. The district court\u2019s reliance on the Inspector General Act as simultaneously creating a \u201cnew context\u201d and as a special factor that forecloses *even traditional* Bivens claims pushes Egbert to an extreme that appellate courts are unlikely to endorse, particularly when that logic would effectively erase Bivens for federal law\u2011enforcement excessive\u2011force claims. That supports reversal on Issue 1.\n\nBy contrast, the failure\u2011to\u2011intervene claims rest on a materially different legal theory that the Supreme Court has never recognized under Bivens, and the district court expressly relied on that difference as an independent ground to treat them as a new context. Because Arias does not meaningfully brief any challenge to that independent ground on appeal, an appellate panel will nearly certainly deem the argument waived and affirm the judgment as to those claims. Taken together, that yields a mixed outcome: reversal and remand on the direct excessive\u2011force Bivens claims, but affirmance of dismissal of the failure\u2011to\u2011intervene claims."

Under Second Circuit precedent, denying appointment of counsel where chances of success appear dubious and the litigant has not shown inability to obtain counsel is well within the range of permissible decisions; there is no showing that the denial was arbitrary or based on an erroneous legal standard."

They were by their terms limited and discretionary, and the statute expressly allows limited appointments.

She identifies no specific evidence that existed but was omitted because she lacked counsel and that, if considered, would create a triable issue on pretext or discriminatory animus. CT Transit offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, and Reynolds offered no admissible evidence to rebut them. De novo review of that record would lead to the same result. Because the denial of counsel was not an abuse of discretion, there is no basis to invalidate the summary judgment on the theory that the record should have been more robust."

The district court applied recognized \u00a7 1915(e)(1) factors and had already exercised discretion multiple times in Reynolds\u2019s favor for limited tasks, which undercuts any claim of arbitrary or improper denial. There is no doctrinal support for converting limited appointments into a continuing right to counsel via stare decisis or law-of-the-case. Finally, Reynolds concedes she did not meet her burden on summary judgment and fails to identify concrete, missing evidence that would alter the legal analysis. An appellate panel in the Second Circuit is very likely to affirm both the denial of counsel and the resulting summary judgment on this record."

      "factual_background":"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. is a global drug-development company that describes itself as the largest provider of outsourced drug discovery, non-clinical development, and regulated safety testing services worldwide. More than 80% of its revenue comes from (1) providing animals for drug-development research and safety testing and (2) conducting that research and testing itself. Federal Food and Drug Administration regulations generally require safety testing on live non-human primates (NHPs), commonly monkeys, for biologic drug development. Charles River is alleged to be the largest commercial user of NHPs in the United States.\n\nA key species used in this work is the long-tailed macaque. Between 2010 and 2019, the international trade in long-tailed macaques was valued at nearly $1.26 billion. Prior to spring 2020, Charles River depended on Chinese exports for more than 60% of its long-tailed macaque supply. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, China halted exports of many wildlife species, and its exports of long-tailed macaques to the United States dropped to zero. At the same time, demand for Charles River's safety-testing services increased as a result of the pandemic. Maintaining profitability required Charles River to rebuild and expand its macaque supply chain.\n\nCharles River responded by rapidly increasing macaque sourcing from Cambodia and related channels. It obtained at least 2,262 long-tailed macaques from Envigo Global Services, Inc. (Envigo) and Orient BioResource Center, Inc. (Orient BioResource). Both entities were later acquired by Inotiv, Inc., a U.S. public company, on November 5, 2021 (Envigo) and January 27, 2022 (Orient BioResource). Envigo and Orient BioResource obtained approximately 60% of their Cambodian long-tailed macaques from the Vanny Group, a Hong Kong-based network led by CEO James Lau, which bred macaques in Cambodia and Vietnam for export. Inotiv's principal supplier of long-tailed macaques was the Vanny Group.\n\nIn addition to this indirect sourcing through Inotiv subsidiaries, Charles River also directly obtained at least 512 macaques from Nafovanny, a Vietnam-based company that was part of the Vanny Group (a joint venture between another Vanny Group subsidiary and the Vietnamese government); more than 1,000 live macaques or macaque-based extracts from another Vanny Group subsidiary, KHI Bioservices Ltd.; at least 956 long-tailed macaques in 2022 from WorldWide Primates, Inc. (WW Primates), a Florida-based broker; and over 10,000 macaques between 2020 and 2022 from K.F. (Cambodia) Ltd. (KF Cambodia), which managed a macaque breeding farm in Cambodia.\n\nFrom May 7, 2020 through November 2, 2022, Charles River's SEC filings stated that \"limited global supply or regional restrictions on transportation for certain products may require us to source products from non-preferred vendors.\" During this period, Charles River's safety-testing business expanded significantly, and its stock price rose from $156.56 per share in May 2020 to a high of $460.21 per share in September 2021.\n\nAt the same time, Cambodia's macaque exports to the United States surged, increasing by up to 86% from 2019 to 2020. According to the complaint, this dramatic increase drew concern from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service). The concern related to biological and legal constraints: breeding long-tailed macaques in captivity takes time (a six-month gestation, typically one infant per pregnancy, and a requirement that infants remain with mothers for at least two years before they are deemed suitable for research), making rapid short-term increases in supply suspicious if claimed to be entirely captive-bred.\n\nWild-caught macaques are problematic because wild populations frequently carry pathogens that make them unsuitable for research, and because Cambodia prohibits the capture and export of wild macaques due to the species' vulnerability to extinction. International and U.S. law (including CITES and U.S. implementing statutes such as the Endangered Species Act and Lacey Act provisions cited in the opinion) make it unlawful to import Cambodian long-tailed macaques that were captured in violation of Cambodian wildlife-protection laws or traded contrary to CITES.\n\nIn August 2021, the DOJ issued a public press release stating that an Orient BioResource executive had pleaded guilty to lying to the Service about whether he had prepared or submitted any audits or reports concerning visits to supplier sites in Cambodia. The press release described an ongoing criminal investigation into international primate trafficking into the United States. In early 2022, Inotiv publicly disclosed in SEC filings that its subsidiaries Envigo and Orient BioResource had received DOJ grand jury subpoenas relating to the importation of non-human primates. According to the complaint, investors at that time were unaware that Inotiv and its subsidiaries were material suppliers of macaques to Charles River.\n\nBy fall 2022, according to the complaint, Charles River began experiencing supply interruptions that were not disclosed to investors as such. On September 21, 2022, the Service seized a KF Cambodia shipment of 360 long-tailed macaques destined for Charles River, valued at approximately $3.24 million. This was the first seizure of a KF Cambodia shipment to Charles River and was carried out under regulatory authority permitting refusal of wildlife clearance when there are reasonable grounds to believe a federal law or regulation has been violated. Analysts, who were unaware of this seizure, continued to view Charles River's position as strong; for example, a September 29, 2022 Jefferies report described the increased macaque demand as a positive scenario for Charles River.\n\nOn November 16, 2022, the DOJ unsealed an indictment alleging a conspiracy to smuggle wild long-tailed macaques into the United States for profit by capturing wild macaques, falsifying export permits, and exporting them. The indictment named James Lau, identified as CEO and owner of Vanny HK, and five other executives and employees of Vanny HK and a subsidiary, Vanny Cambodia. It also charged several Cambodian officials and two unnamed U.S.-based companies as co-conspirators. The lead plaintiff alleges that those unnamed U.S. companies were Inotiv (or its subsidiaries) and WW Primates. The accompanying DOJ press release referred to an \"international primate smuggling ring\" and identified at least two defendants as employees of the Vanny Group. Analysts discussing those suppliers often used the umbrella name \"Vanny\" rather than distinguishing among individual subsidiaries.\n\nOn November 17, 2022, Inotiv filed with the SEC stating that its \"principal supplier\" of macaques was a target of the indictment. The complaint alleges that, at that time, investors still did not know that Inotiv was a material macaque supplier to Charles River or that Charles River was likely purchasing macaques originating from the indicted supplier network.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, Charles River filed an SEC disclosure stating that the company was not named or referenced in the DOJ proceedings and that it did not have any direct supply contracts with the indicted Cambodian supplier. The disclosure acknowledged that, in light of the indictment and statements by the Cambodian government, Charles River expected that Cambodia-sourced macaque supply would be difficult to obtain in the United States for some period.\n\nThat same day, CEO James C. Foster spoke at an investor conference. He noted that Charles River procured most of its macaques from Cambodia and discussed the potential supply impact of the indictment. He stated that Charles River had received feedback from Cambodian officials who were displeased with the DOJ action and that the company anticipated some disruption and difficulty in getting macaques into the United States. He then told investors that the supply challenges did not include Charles River's own suppliers being indicted, echoing the SEC filing by asserting that Charles River had no direct contracts with the indicted supplier. Foster described Charles River's supplier due diligence regarding management, veterinary, shipping, and husbandry practices, and stated that its Cambodian facilities were \"extremely high quality,\" as were all of its suppliers. He indicated that the indicted supplier was not a supplier of Charles River and suggested that, absent Cambodian government interference, Charles River might be \"fine\" and that the indictment had no real short-term impact on the company, although it could hurt \"some folks\" who relied on the affected supplier.\n\nAfter these public assurances, Charles River allegedly continued to experience severe supply-chain issues. In December 2022 and January 2023, four additional KF Cambodia shipments headed to Charles River were seized at the border. Together with the September 2022 seizure, the Service refused entry to more than $17.4 million in macaques destined for Charles River, which plaintiffs allege represented nearly 8% of Charles River's 2022 NHP supply.\n\nOn January 12, 2023, Jefferies issued a research report based on public data, channel checks, industry conversations, and a tweet from a Cambodian official. The report stated that, while Jefferies had previously concluded that Charles River's macaque business was in a privileged position and controlled its own supply destiny, the indictment of Vanny and Cambodian officials altered that view. The report estimated that approximately 24% of Charles River's macaque usage relied on Vanny supply, likely through an indirect relationship, and that this dependence was underappreciated by investors. Jefferies further stated that, after investigation, it believed Charles River had received more than 20% of its macaque supply from Vanny in 2021 and 2022 through indirect channels. Following this report, Charles River's stock price fell roughly 6% on unusually heavy trading.\n\nOn February 22, 2023, Charles River issued a press release disclosing that it had received a grand jury subpoena in an investigation related to several shipments of macaques received from its Cambodian supplier and that it had voluntarily suspended macaque shipments from Cambodia. On the same day, Charles River filed with the SEC that DOJ had commenced an investigation into Charles River's conduct regarding several macaque shipments from Cambodia. The company's stock price fell by more than 10% on high trading volume following these disclosures.\n\nOn March 15, 2023, Foster told investors on a conference call that Charles River had historically used suppliers \"that get animals from wherever,\" although it preferred not to use such suppliers. Following this call, the stock price declined by about 5% on elevated trading volume.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that shipments previously seized by the Service were later cleared and related investigations were closed, but maintains that, during the class period, investors were unaware of the seizures and the extent of Charles River's connection to suppliers implicated in the DOJ investigation and indictment.",

On November 14, 2023, State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, as court-appointed lead plaintiff, filed an amended complaint on behalf of a putative class of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Charles River securities between May 7, 2020 and March 15, 2023, inclusive. The amended complaint asserted (1) a claim under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 against Charles River and the individual officer defendants, alleging material misstatements and omissions in public statements and filings, and (2) a derivative control-person liability claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against Foster and Smith, predicated on the alleged Section 10(b) violations.",

The court further held that the complaint failed to plead scienter with the particularity and strength required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Because it found no adequately pleaded Section 10(b) violation, the court determined that the derivative Section 20(a) control-person claim also failed. In light of these rulings, the court did not reach the issue of loss causation.",

State Teachers seeks reinstatement of its Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) claims based on allegedly misleading statements and omissions concerning Charles River's macaque supply chain and its exposure to the DOJ's investigation and indictment of Vanny Group-related suppliers. Charles River, as appellee, urges affirmance of the dismissal and also asks the appellate court to uphold dismissal on the alternative ground that plaintiffs failed to plead loss causation, an issue that the district court did not address."

According to appellants, these omissions rendered the assurances false or misleading half-truths because they gave investors the impression that Charles River's supply chain was insulated from the indicted smuggling ring when, in fact, it relied on that network directly and indirectly.",
          "They contend that Charles River\u2019s repeated SEC disclosures from May 2020 through November 2022 that it \"may\" need to source from \"non-preferred vendors\" were deceptive because, by then, the company was already relying on vendors facing law-enforcement scrutiny, including suppliers that would later be the subject of DOJ subpoenas and an indictment. Appellants assert that characterizing this situation as a mere conditional future possibility understated present adverse conditions in the supply chain.",
          "Appellants maintain that scienter is strongly inferred because Charles River and Foster allegedly knew or were reckless in not knowing that: (a) Inotiv\u2019s principal supplier was a target of the DOJ indictment; (b) Charles River was indirectly sourcing significant macaque volume from the indicted Vanny Group network; (c) a Charles-River-bound shipment from KF Cambodia had been seized in September 2022; and (d) additional seizures followed in December 2022 and January 2023. Despite that, they publicly told investors that the indicted supplier was not a supplier of Charles River and downplayed the impact of the indictment as having no real short-term effect on the company. Appellants argue that Foster's careful use of the word \"direct\" in describing supply contracts supports an inference that he intended to minimize or obscure Charles River's indirect ties to the indicted supplier and its exposure to the DOJ investigation.",

They assert that any indirect relationships via intermediaries like Inotiv were not misrepresented, because they never affirmatively stated that no indirect relationship existed and that there was no duty to disclose every tangential or indirect supply connection merely because they commented on the indictment\u2019s impact on the industry.",
          "They further argue that their cautionary statements acknowledging potential supply disruptions\u2014such as expectations of difficulty obtaining Cambodia-sourced macaques due to possible Cambodian government pushback\u2014made clear to investors that there were risks and uncertainties in the supply chain, and that these forward-looking, risk-focused statements cannot reasonably be read as assurances that Charles River\u2019s supply chain was fully insulated from any legal or regulatory developments. In their view, the statements about \"non-preferred vendors\" used the term in a broad, business-oriented sense (e.g., price, quality, logistics) and not as a code for vendors under law-enforcement scrutiny, and plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that investors or the company used the term in the narrow way plaintiffs propose.",
          "On scienter, appellees contend that the complaint does not provide particularized facts showing that Foster or other executives knew that Charles River\u2019s suppliers were under active DOJ investigation or indictment in a way that directly implicated Charles River, or that they intended to mislead investors. They maintain that the complaint at most shows that certain suppliers and intermediaries were under investigation and that one shipment had been seized, facts that, in their view, are consistent with a good-faith belief that any issues were isolated or were being resolved. They also emphasize that shipments were later cleared and related investigations closed, and argue that this undercuts any inference that they believed their supply chain was unlawful or fatally compromised at the time of the challenged statements.",
          "They point to Foster\u2019s and Charles River\u2019s explicit warnings about potential supply disruption and their acknowledgment that Cambodia-sourced macaques could be difficult to obtain, contending that these warnings are inconsistent with an intent to mislead and instead demonstrate an effort to inform investors of risks. They argue that plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Foster\u2019s use of the word \"direct\" to show scienter is speculative and that reasonable executives might naturally distinguish between direct contracts and indirect supply relationships without any fraudulent intent.",
          "As an alternative ground to uphold dismissal, appellees argue that the complaint fails to plead loss causation because it does not identify a true corrective disclosure that revealed prior alleged misstatements as false. They maintain that the January 12, 2023 Jefferies report was based on public information and analyst inferences rather than new, company-specific facts; that the February 22, 2023 DOJ-subpoena disclosure did not contradict any prior statements or reveal fraud; and that the March 15, 2023 comments about suppliers \"that get animals from wherever\" were not corrective but, at most, general observations. In their view, the alleged stock price declines cannot be reliably attributed to revelation of fraud as opposed to market reactions to regulatory risk or general industry developments.",

On November 30, 2022, after the Vanny\u2011related indictment was unsealed, Charles River and Foster chose to speak directly about the impact of the indictment and the company\u2019s relationship with the indicted supplier, telling investors that (1) Charles River had no direct contracts with the indicted Cambodian supplier and (2) the indicted supplier was not a supplier of Charles River, while suggesting that any disruption stemmed from Cambodian government reactions rather than from Charles River\u2019s own supply chain. The complaint alleges contemporaneous facts that, if true, make those assurances incomplete in a way that could mislead a reasonable investor: (a) Charles River had recently had at least one Cambodian shipment (from KF Cambodia) seized by federal authorities based on suspected illegality, and more seizures followed soon after; (b) Charles River was directly obtaining macaques from Vanny\u2011network affiliates (Nafovanny, KHI) and indirectly obtaining a material part of its supply through Inotiv, whose \u201cprincipal supplier\u201d was within the indicted network; and (c) these connections plausibly exposed Charles River to the same smuggling concerns driving the indictment. By affirmatively reassuring investors that the indicted supplier was not a supplier of Charles River, while omitting that Charles River relied heavily on the indicted supplier\u2019s network via affiliates and intermediaries, the complaint plausibly alleges a misleading half\u2011truth, not merely a technically accurate statement about the absence of a single named contract. Likewise, the repeated SEC risk disclosures from 2020\u20132022 that the company \u201cmay\u201d need to source from non\u2011preferred vendors are plausibly alleged to be misleading to the extent that, during that entire period, Charles River in fact was already relying on higher\u2011risk vendors in Cambodia and Vietnam and had begun to experience law\u2011enforcement scrutiny and a significant shipment seizure. A factfinder could conclude that describing this as a contingent possibility rather than an ongoing reality understated present supply\u2011chain risk. Under de novo review at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, these allegations suffice to state material misstatements or omissions; the district court\u2019s contrary conclusion is likely reversed at least as to the core November 30 statements and related risk disclosures."

Despite this, Foster publicly assured investors that the indicted supplier \u201cwas not a supplier of Charles River,\u201d that Charles River had no direct contracts with that supplier, and that the indictment did not really affect the company in the short term, while emphasizing the quality of its Cambodian suppliers. Plaintiffs also allege that Foster\u2019s carefully limited references to \u201cdirect contracts\u201d and his subsequent admission that Charles River historically used suppliers \u201cthat get animals from wherever\u201d support an inference that he appreciated the legal sensitivities of Charles River\u2019s sourcing and nonetheless chose to minimize them. Weighing these allegations collectively, and crediting the pleaded inferences on a motion to dismiss, the inference that Foster and Charles River at least acted with reckless disregard of the truth when downplaying their exposure to the indicted network is at least as cogent as the benign explanation that they believed issues were isolated or immaterial, especially given the scale of the seizures and the centrality of macaque supply to the business. The district court\u2019s conclusion that scienter was not adequately pleaded thus likely constitutes error at the pleading stage, and is reversed."

          "reasoning":"Although the district court did not reach loss causation, appellees press it as an alternative ground. On de novo review, the complaint\u2019s allegations are sufficient to plead loss causation. Plaintiffs identify specific events\u2014(1) the January 12, 2023 Jefferies report revealing Charles River\u2019s apparent substantial reliance on the Vanny network; (2) Charles River\u2019s February 22, 2023 disclosure of a DOJ grand jury subpoena relating to Cambodian macaque shipments and its voluntary suspension of such shipments; and (3) the March 15, 2023 call where Foster acknowledged using suppliers \u201cthat get animals from wherever\u201d\u2014each followed by statistically significant stock price declines on heavy volume. Plaintiffs plausibly characterize these as corrective disclosures or at least as materializations of the previously concealed risk that Charles River\u2019s supply chain was entangled with an indicted smuggling network and under DOJ scrutiny, contradicting the earlier November 30 assurances that the indicted supplier was not a supplier and that the short\u2011term impact was minimal. The fact that the Jefferies report drew inferences from available information does not preclude it from serving as a partial corrective disclosure if, as alleged, it brought to light for the market the extent of Charles River\u2019s Vanny\u2011related exposure that had been obscured. Similarly, the DOJ subpoena and suspension of Cambodian shipments directly revealed a governmental investigation into Charles River\u2019s own conduct\u2014information investors were not previously told despite management\u2019s decision to speak on the subject. At the pleading stage, it is not necessary to parse which disclosure accounted for what portion of the price decline; it is enough that the complaint plausibly links revelation of the alleged fraud and concealed risk to subsequent losses. The appellate court is likely to reject loss causation as a basis to affirm dismissal."

The complaint alleges that Foster was CEO and Smith was CFO during the relevant time, positions that ordinarily suffice to plead control at the motion\u2011to\u2011dismiss stage. Because the primary violation is plausibly alleged for pleading purposes, the basis for dismissing the Section 20(a) claim falls away.

      "reasoning":"The dispositive issues\u2014falsity\/omission and scienter\u2014are reviewed de novo at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. The complaint is detailed and ties specific statements to concrete contemporaneous facts: an ongoing DOJ\/Fish & Wildlife investigation, multiple multimillion\u2011dollar seizures of Charles\u2011River\u2011bound macaques from Cambodian suppliers, and extensive direct and indirect ties to the indicted Vanny network. Against that backdrop, Foster chose to speak on November 30, 2022, in a way that, viewed favorably to plaintiffs, affirmatively reassured investors that the indicted supplier was not a supplier of Charles River and that the indictment had little short\u2011term impact, while omitting the company\u2019s actual dependence on the same network through affiliates and intermediaries and the already\u2011occurred seizure. This fits squarely within the line of cases holding that once an issuer speaks on a topic, it must do so in a way that is not materially misleading by half\u2011truth or omission. The scienter allegations, taken holistically, are at least as consistent with recklessness as with innocent misjudgment, especially given the centrality of macaque supply to Charles River\u2019s business model and the magnitude of the seizures. Appellees\u2019 alternative loss\u2011causation argument is unlikely to sustain dismissal, because the complaint identifies concrete corrective\u2011type disclosures and corresponding stock price declines plausibly linked to the revelation of the concealed risk and alleged misstatements. With material misstatements, scienter, and loss causation adequately pleaded, the Section 10(b) claim should be reinstated, and the derivative Section 20(a) claim should proceed as well. The likely appellate outcome is a reversal of the dismissal in full and remand for further proceedings."

Jules was represented in that litigation by attorney Thomas A. Farinella. Jules had entered into an arbitration agreement with Chateau Holdings, Ltd. (\"Chateau\"). The arbitration agreement contained a broad clause providing that \"any dispute arising out of this Agreement will be determined by the arbitrator\" and expressly incorporated Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) rules, including provisions assigning jurisdictional and arbitrability disputes to the arbitrator. Pursuant to this arbitration agreement, the district court stayed Jules\u2019s federal action pending arbitration between Jules and Chateau. An arbitration proceeded under that agreement, and an arbitration award was ultimately entered against both Jules and Farinella. During the arbitration, Jules asserted that Chateau materially breached the arbitration agreement by allegedly failing to timely pay an arbitration fee as required under California Civil Procedure Code \u00a7 1281.98(a)(1). Based on that alleged breach, Jules later sought to have the district court lift its stay of the federal action, contending that the arbitration agreement was no longer enforceable or that the arbitration should not proceed. After the arbitration concluded, the defendants in the federal action moved in the district court to confirm the arbitration award.

Under Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent, incorporation of such rules plus a broad delegation clause is clear and unmistakable evidence that gateway questions of arbitrability and related procedural issues (including compliance with arbitral fee obligations and any alleged material breach affecting continued arbitrability) are for the arbitrator, not the court.

Under Supreme Court and Second Circuit authority, when a federal court with proper subject matter jurisdiction stays a case under \u00a7 3 and sends the dispute to arbitration, it retains ancillary jurisdiction to entertain post\u2011arbitration applications involving that same arbitration, including motions to confirm or vacate. Thus the court did not need a fresh jurisdictional basis on the face of the confirmation motion itself, and its assertion of subject matter jurisdiction to confirm the award is consistent with that line of precedent, notwithstanding Badgerow."

As to the defendants, they initiated the motion in a case already properly before the court and in which they were named parties.

      },
      "factual_background":"In 2019, 63-year-old Robert Miller died at his home on Cape Cod following an encounter with Barnstable police officers Sean Roycroft and Spencer Jackson. Around 7:03 p.m., Miller's girlfriend, Amy Anderson, called 911 stating that Miller needed a psychological evaluation and reporting no crime. Officer Roycroft arrived at Miller's residence at approximately 7:09 p.m., and Officer Jackson arrived about a minute later. The interaction between Miller and the officers in the home led to a physical struggle in an office area of the house. At approximately 7:10 p.m., during the course of this struggle, Roycroft had his arms wrapped around Miller's chest from behind when the two men fell face down to the floor. As they fell, Roycroft's estimated 220 pounds of body weight and gear came down on Miller, who landed on a golf club. After the fall, both of Miller's arms and Roycroft's left arm were pinned under Miller's body, with Roycroft positioned partly on Miller's left side. Roycroft's right leg was over Miller's left leg, and his right arm was between Miller's shoulder blades. Miller attempted to lift his chest off the floor, and Roycroft used his right forearm to press down on Miller's back to prevent Miller from creating space between his chest and the floor. Jackson attempted to assist in gaining control of Miller's hands so they could be handcuffed. Jackson first delivered a half-strength punch to Miller's right side in an effort to distract him and free his hands, but this did not succeed. At 7:11:52 p.m., Jackson radioed for backup and then delivered a second punch to Miller. Following this second punch, Roycroft freed his left arm. Jackson then pulled Miller's right hand from beneath his body and placed a handcuff on Miller's right wrist, while Roycroft took hold of Miller's left hand. Anderson observed one of the officers place a knee into Miller's back to gain leverage while they were handcuffing him. She heard Miller say, \"I can't breathe\" and \"Amy, help me\" during the handcuffing process; the officers did not dispute that she reported hearing these statements. Jackson ultimately secured Miller's left wrist in handcuffs behind Miller's back and double-locked the cuffs. Roycroft then attempted to help Miller to his feet but was unable to do so. Observing that Miller's pupils were fixed, Roycroft rolled Miller onto his side so he would not remain face down, realized that Miller was not breathing and had no pulse, called for medical assistance at 7:12:58 p.m., and began CPR. An ambulance transported Miller to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8:00 p.m. The medical examiner reported Miller's cause of death as cardiac dysrhythmia in the setting of excited delirium due to an unknown psychiatric illness at the time of restraint. The plaintiff's medical expert opined that Miller instead died from a prone restraint cardiac arrest caused by pressure applied to his back that impaired his breathing. The events of the restraint were brief, unfolding over approximately three minutes from initial officer arrival to the call for an ambulance. The record reflects training and guidance known to the officers regarding the risks of positional asphyxia and restraint-related asphyxiation in prone positions, particularly for individuals with characteristics like Miller's (age, weight, physical condition). Anderson's account and expert testimony support an inference that Miller's movements on the floor may have been attempts to breathe rather than efforts to resist or attack the officers, while the officers have characterized their actions as necessary to control a potentially dangerous situation.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"Ian Miller, as personal representative of the Estate of Robert Joseph Miller, filed suit against Officers Spencer Jackson and Sean Roycroft in their individual capacities. The complaint asserted a federal claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for use of excessive force in violation of Miller's constitutional rights. The plaintiff alleged that both officers personally used excessive force and that Jackson additionally failed to intervene to stop Roycroft's excessive force. The plaintiff also asserted a state-law wrongful death claim premised on the same underlying conduct.",
        "district_court_decision":"Following discovery, Roycroft and Jackson moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity as to the \u00a7 1983 excessive force and failure-to-intervene claims, and sought summary judgment on the related wrongful death claim. The district court evaluated whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, a reasonable jury could find that the officers' use of force was objectively unreasonable under Graham v. Connor, considering the severity of any crime, the threat posed, and the extent of resistance. The court concluded that a jury could find that Miller had committed no crime, had no weapon, had not threatened or struck anyone, and that there was insufficient evidence that he deliberately trapped Roycroft\u2019s arm. The court also found that, based on expert testimony, a jury could infer that Miller's movements were attempts to relieve pressure in order to breathe, rather than active resistance, and that the officers were on notice of the risk of restraint-related asphyxiation to a prone, face-down individual like Miller. The district court divided the events into two phases: Phase One, from the fall to the floor while Roycroft\u2019s arm was pinned and he used his body and forearm to keep Miller down, and Phase Two, after Roycroft freed his arm and the officers handcuffed Miller, including the alleged application of a knee to Miller's back. As to the constitutional violation prong, the court determined that, under the plaintiff-favorable version of events, a reasonable jury could find that there was little or no need for the amount of force used and that the force was excessive. On the clearly established law prong, the court relied on First Circuit and other precedent, including McCue v. City of Bangor and Abdullahi v. City of Madison, to find that it was clearly established well before 2019 that exerting significant, continued force on the back of a prone, face-down person who has been subdued or incapacitated, including by kneeling on the person\u2019s back, constitutes excessive force. The court found evidence from which a jury could infer that, once on the floor, Roycroft applied pressure on Miller's back with his right arm and then with his knee while Miller was restrained, and that Miller stated he could not breathe and called out for help. The court inferred that an objectively reasonable officer, with the training and knowledge possessed by Roycroft and Jackson, would have recognized that Miller was struggling to breathe, not resisting. The court accordingly ruled that Roycroft had fair notice that subduing an unarmed, mentally unstable individual with compressive body weight after the individual indicated he could not breathe would violate clearly established rights, and denied summary judgment to Roycroft on qualified immunity grounds. Regarding Jackson, the court recognized a clearly established duty to intervene to prevent another officer\u2019s excessive force when feasible, citing Davis v. Rennie. The court found that Jackson\u2019s initial body punches to try to free Roycroft\u2019s arm could be viewed as reasonable given the limited information he had and a perceived need to assist a fellow officer, but identified factual disputes about what happened immediately afterwards, including how long Miller was on the floor, whether and for how long either officer put a knee on Miller\u2019s back and with what amount of pressure, and whether Jackson knew or should have known that Miller was struggling to breathe rather than resisting. The court concluded that depending on whose factual version a jury credited, Jackson might or might not be protected by qualified immunity, and therefore denied summary judgment on the qualified immunity defense for Jackson as well. Because the court found disputed material facts as to whether the officers used excessive force, it also denied summary judgment on the state wrongful death claim, apparently treating that claim as dependent on the success of the excessive force theory.",
        "what_is_appealed":"Roycroft and Jackson filed an interlocutory appeal from the district court's order denying them summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. They challenge the district court's determination that their use of force after the fall to the floor\u2014both during Phase One (when Roycroft's arm was pinned and he applied body and forearm pressure) and Phase Two (when his arm was free and an officer allegedly placed a knee on Miller's back while handcuffing him)\u2014was governed by clearly established law that would have alerted reasonable officers that their conduct was unconstitutional. With respect to Jackson, they also appeal the denial of qualified immunity on the failure-to-intervene theory. The appeal thus contests the district court\u2019s rulings on the clearly established law prong of the qualified immunity analysis and the denial of summary judgment on the related federal and derivative state claims, to the extent those rulings rest on the qualified immunity determinations."

          "For Phase One, the officers argue that no clearly established precedent, as of 2019, prohibited the kind of force Roycroft used while his left arm was pinned beneath Miller and before Miller was fully restrained. They contend that cases like McCue and Abdullahi are distinguishable because in those cases the officers were not themselves physically immobilized, and the force at issue was applied to a person who had already been subdued or incapacitated, whereas Roycroft remained at risk due to his trapped arm and Miller\u2019s movements.",
          "They assert that the general rule against excessive force is too abstract to provide clear notice in the circumstances they faced and that the existing case law did not put beyond debate that maintaining body and forearm pressure on a prone individual in order to free an immobilized arm and achieve control would violate the Constitution.",
          "With respect to Phase Two, the officers argue that McCue\u2019s clearly established rule\u2014that exerting significant, continued force on the back of a prone individual after the person has been subdued or incapacitated constitutes excessive force\u2014applies only to force used after a person has been handcuffed. They note that McCue involved a handcuffed individual and maintain that \"subdued\" or \"restrained\" in that context should be equated with \"handcuffed.\" They further argue that because, in their view, no knee or similar pressure was applied to Miller\u2019s back after he was fully handcuffed, their conduct falls outside the scope of McCue\u2019s clearly established rule.",
          "They also contend that any knee-on-back contact during Phase Two was brief and constituted only \"low-level, empty-hand force\" used to facilitate handcuffing in a dynamic situation, rather than the \"significant, continued\" force described in McCue, and thus would not have been clearly established as unconstitutional. They challenge the district court\u2019s reliance on inferences that the pressure was substantial or prolonged, arguing that the evidence supports at most a few seconds of contact.",
          "The officers further argue that they reasonably perceived Anderson to be in a dangerous situation given Miller\u2019s behavior prior to the 911 call and that Miller\u2019s movements, including flailing legs and being on top of a golf club or possibly another object, could reasonably have been interpreted as resistance or an effort to access a potential weapon. They maintain that, in light of this perceived threat, the level and type of force they used were objectively reasonable and that existing case law did not clearly prohibit their actions under such circumstances.",
          "As to Jackson\u2019s alleged failure to intervene, the officers argue that there was no clearly established duty requiring him to intervene during the brief period at issue, particularly while he was actively engaged in the process of trying to handcuff Miller. They assert that there is no evidence he delayed his effort to secure Miller or had a realistic opportunity or sufficient time to prevent or stop any excessive force by Roycroft. They further submit that, without a clearly established underlying violation by Roycroft during the relevant time frame, Jackson had no corresponding duty to intervene.",
          "Procedurally, the officers contest the district court\u2019s factual characterizations, including the inference that Miller was not resisting and was not dangerous, the suggestion that Miller\u2019s statements about breathing were clear indicators of distress that they should have credited, and the notion that the weight or duration of any knee pressure was as extensive as the plaintiff\u2019s expert suggests.

          "He contends that the officers were trained on and aware of the risks of positional and restraint-related asphyxia to prone, face-down individuals, particularly in circumstances like Miller\u2019s, and that they knew or should have known that keeping substantial body weight and pressure on Miller\u2019s back, especially while he complained he could not breathe, was dangerous and unnecessary.",
          "Regarding clearly established law, the appellee relies heavily on McCue and its adoption of Abdullahi, arguing that by 2012 it was clearly established that exerting significant, continued force on a prone person\u2019s back after the person has been subdued or incapacitated constitutes excessive force. He emphasizes that Abdullahi involved an officer placing his knee and shin on an uncuffed suspect\u2019s upper back or shoulder area for 30 to 45 seconds, and that the suspect\u2019s attempts to arch his back might have been efforts to breathe rather than resistance. The appellee argues that this precedent clearly put officers on notice that kneeling on the back of a prone, subdued individual, even before handcuffing is fully completed, can be unconstitutional.",
          "He rejects the officers\u2019 contention that \"subdued\" or \"restrained\" must mean \"handcuffed,\" arguing that the caselaw focuses on the suspect\u2019s incapacitation and lack of resistance, not the mere fact of handcuffing. Under the plaintiff\u2019s version of the facts, Miller was effectively subdued, not a threat, and was struggling to breathe, so applying compressive weight through a knee to his back fell squarely within the conduct condemned by McCue and Abdullahi.",
          "The appellee also points to federal guidance and law enforcement training materials warning of positional asphyxia from prone restraints, arguing that these materials, together with the case law, made clear to reasonable officers that continuing to apply compressive force to Miller\u2019s back after he indicated he could not breathe, and when he was not actively resisting or threatening, violated clearly established rights.",
          "On the failure-to-intervene claim, the appellee cites Davis v. Rennie to argue that it was clearly established that an officer present at the scene who observes excessive force and has a realistic opportunity to prevent it, but fails to act, may be liable. He maintains that, accepting his version of events, Jackson was present and participating during the entire period in which Roycroft (or Jackson) allegedly applied knee pressure to Miller\u2019s back, had approximately two minutes or more while Miller was face down on the floor, and had the time and ability to recognize that Miller was struggling to breathe and that the force had become excessive and to intervene by stopping or reducing the pressure.",
          "The appellee further contends that much of the officers\u2019 appeal is an improper attempt to relitigate the district court\u2019s factual findings and inferences, including disputes over the duration and intensity of the knee pressure, whether Miller was resisting, whether he posed a danger, and exactly what Jackson could see and do. He argues that under Johnson v. Jones and related precedent, such fact-based challenges are not reviewable in this interlocutory posture, and that the only proper question on appeal is whether, taking the district court\u2019s plaintiff-favorable factual view, the officers violated clearly established law."

On that view, in Phase One Miller had committed no crime, was unarmed, had not struck anyone, and his movements could be understood as attempts to breathe under compressive weight rather than resistance, while Roycroft\u2014trained on positional asphyxia\u2014kept significant body and forearm pressure on the back of a prone, older, overweight man who said he could not breathe. The officers\u2019 argument that no case with identical facts (pinned arm, pre\u2011handcuff) existed is too narrow. First Circuit precedent (e.g., McCue, adopting Abdullahi) and the broader consensus clearly established by 2012 that maintaining substantial compressive force on the back of a prone, effectively subdued person who is not posing an immediate threat and is showing signs of breathing distress is excessive. The clearly established inquiry does not require a case about a trapped arm; it requires that every reasonable officer would understand that the force, in context, was unlawful. Given the training on prone restraints and the existing case law, the appellate court will likely agree with the district court that, taking the facts in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, Roycroft had fair notice even during Phase One and is not entitled to qualified immunity.

McCue and Abdullahi squarely held that exerting significant, continued force on the back of a prone individual who has been subdued\/incapacitated is excessive force, and that principle was clearly established well before 2019. Abdullahi involved knee pressure on an uncuffed but subdued suspect\u2019s upper back\/shoulder area; thus the rule is not limited to already\u2011handcuffed individuals. The officers\u2019 attempt to equate \u2018subdued\u2019 with \u2018handcuffed\u2019 is narrower than the reasoning of those cases and is unlikely to persuade the appellate court. Likewise, their characterization of the knee pressure as only brief, \u201clow\u2011level\u201d contact is a factual dispute; the district court reasonably inferred from Anderson\u2019s testimony and the expert\u2019s account that the compressive force could be found by a jury to be substantial and of meaningful duration. Under the plaintiff\u2011favorable facts, continuing to apply knee\/body weight to the back of a prone, non\u2011threatening man who is struggling to breathe falls within the heartland of conduct condemned in McCue\/Abdullahi and related training materials on positional asphyxia. The appellate court will likely hold that the unlawfulness of that conduct was clearly established and affirm the denial of qualified immunity for Phase Two."

That duty is not limited to long time frames or to situations in which the officer is doing nothing else; it turns on whether there was a realistic chance to act under the circumstances. On the district court\u2019s view of the record, Jackson was present throughout the prone restraint, was participating in handcuffing while knee pressure was applied to Miller\u2019s back, and there was roughly a couple of minutes during which Miller was on the floor exhibiting signs of breathing distress and saying he could not breathe. On those assumed facts, a reasonable jury could find that (1) Roycroft\u2019s (or Jackson\u2019s) compressive force became clearly excessive during Phase Two, and (2) Jackson had time and ability to recognize this and either stop or reduce the force. The officers\u2019 arguments that Jackson had no realistic opportunity and that any window was too brief rest on a different factual narrative, which Johnson v. Jones bars the appellate court from revisiting at this interlocutory stage. The purely legal question\u2014whether the duty to intervene was clearly established in such circumstances\u2014must be answered yes.

Under Johnson v. Jones, the appellate court will refuse to reweigh those facts and will evaluate qualified immunity assuming the scenario the district court described: an unarmed, non\u2011criminal, older man, prone and face\u2011down, exhibiting potential breathing distress and saying he could not breathe, on whom trained officers maintained substantial body\/knee pressure. With those assumptions, existing First Circuit law (especially McCue adopting Abdullahi) and the well\u2011known training on positional asphyxia made it clearly established by 2019 that significant compressive force on the back of a prone, effectively subdued person is excessive. That reasoning applies both to Phase One (continued compressive force on a prone, minimally threatening subject) and Phase Two (knee\u2011on\u2011back while handcuffing a subdued, distressed individual). For Jackson, Davis v. Rennie and similar cases clearly established a duty to intervene when there is a realistic opportunity to prevent excessive force, and on the district court\u2019s timeline and factual inferences, a jury could find such an opportunity existed. Consequently, on each properly reviewable legal question, the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity is likely to be affirmed, and any fact\u2011based challenges will be dismissed as beyond interlocutory jurisdiction. The overall outcome is therefore an affirmance of the order denying summary judgment on qualified immunity and the derivative state claim."

      "factual_background":"Elliott Ambrosio and the other named plaintiffs were insured under automobile insurance policies issued by Progressive Preferred Insurance Company and Progressive Advanced Insurance Company in Arizona. They made first-party property-damage claims after their vehicles were involved in incidents that resulted in Progressive determining the vehicles to be total losses. Under the governing Arizona Auto Policy, Progressive agreed to pay the \"actual cash value\" (ACV) of a covered auto that was a total loss. The contract states that the ACV \"is determined by the market value, age, and condition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.\" To calculate the market value component of ACV, Progressive used the WorkCenter Total-Loss system licensed from Mitchell International, Inc., which produced valuation reports referred to as \"Mitchell Reports.\" These reports identified comparable vehicles for sale or recently sold in the insureds\u2019 market area. As part of the valuation process, the Mitchell system applied a \"projected sold adjustment\" (PSA) to the list prices of comparable vehicles. The PSA is a downward adjustment intended, according to Progressive, to reflect consumer purchasing behavior, i.e., that many used vehicles sell for less than their advertised list price. Progressive acknowledges that the PSA operates as a downward-only adjustment and that, at least until July 2021, the data used to calculate the PSA excluded transactions in which vehicles sold at or above list price. After July 2021, the PSA calculation began to include transactions where the sold price equaled the list price, but continued to exclude transactions where cars sold for more than list price; in any event, the PSA was still applied only as a negative adjustment to the Mitchell valuation and never as an upward adjustment. The plaintiffs allege that this methodology for determining ACV is fundamentally flawed because the PSA is an inherently one-sided, negative line-item adjustment that does not reflect true market conditions. They contend that the PSA calculation improperly includes discounted sales due to factors such as military or promotional discounts that should not apply to typical market value and that the data sources treat sales above list price as \"outliers\" and omit them. According to plaintiffs, this method skews the calculated market value downward, causing Progressive to pay less than the true ACV owed under the policy to all insureds whose claims were valued using a Mitchell Report with a PSA. Plaintiffs assert that Progressive\u2019s method breaches the express policy term requiring ACV to be determined by the \"market value, age, and condition\" of the vehicle at the time of loss and also violates Progressive\u2019s implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by systematically underpaying claims through use of the PSA. Progressive maintains that the PSA is a legitimate and contractually permissible way to reflect how vehicles are actually bought and sold, and that its policies do not prohibit such an adjustment. Progressive further asserts that what constitutes \"market value\" is a factual question and that other valuation methods, including reference to guides such as the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) and Kelley Blue Book (KBB), are standard in market appraisals and could, in some cases, produce lower valuations than the Mitchell Report even with PSA applied.",

Plaintiffs sought to represent a class defined as all persons who made a first-party claim on a Progressive Preferred or Progressive Advanced policy issued to an Arizona resident, where (1) the claim was submitted between March 4, 2016 and the date of any class certification order; (2) Progressive determined the vehicle was a total loss; and (3) Progressive based its claim payment on a Mitchell \"Instant Report\" that applied a PSA to at least one comparable vehicle.",

It found that the requirements of Rule 23(a) were satisfied: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. In particular, the court held that the legitimacy of Progressive\u2019s use of PSAs as a method for calculating ACV under the uniform policy language presented a question common to the proposed class sufficient to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). The court also recognized that plaintiffs had alleged a common injury theory: that class-wide use of the PSA led to devalued ACVs and underpayment of total-loss claims. However, the court determined that plaintiffs had not met the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). The court reasoned that there were at least two other potential methodologies for estimating ACV, including use of NADA and KBB valuation guides, and that determining whether each putative class member had actually been underpaid would require individualized inquiries comparing the amount paid (based on the Mitchell Report with PSA) to some measure of that specific vehicle\u2019s true ACV. Because, in the court\u2019s view, individual questions surrounding the calculation of each insured\u2019s ACV and whether any underpayment occurred would predominate over common questions, the court declined to certify the proposed Rule 23(b)(3) damages class.",

They contend that by systematically applying a PSA that is a one-sided, downward-only adjustment based on selectively filtered data (excluding or historically excluding transactions at or above list price), Progressive has adopted a methodology that, by its nature, underpays ACV relative to what the contract requires. This alleged breach of a uniform method is, in their view, a common issue suitable for class-wide proof, independent of each insured\u2019s individual vehicle value.",
          "They assert that the injury is likewise common: every class member whose total-loss claim was valued with a Mitchell Report containing a PSA suffered a reduction from what the Mitchell system initially calculated as the vehicle\u2019s value, and thus, they say, from the ACV that should have been paid under the contract. Even if the quantum of damages (the amount of underpayment) varies among class members, the fact and mechanism of injury\u2014imposition of the PSA against the Mitchell valuation\u2014are uniform and predominately common, making any variation in the degree of harm a damages issue that does not defeat class certification.",
          "Plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s reliance on NADA and KBB as alternative valuation methods at the class certification stage, arguing there is insufficient evidence that these guides fall within the parties\u2019 contractual understanding of how ACV is to be determined. They point out that Progressive did not actually use NADA or KBB to pay the claims at issue and that their own expert\u2019s deposition, when read in full, describes NADA and KBB as general guides that do not account for the specific characteristics or geographic location of individual vehicles. They contend that whether the contract permits or contemplates reliance on such guides is itself a common interpretive question that should be resolved class-wide, not used at certification to defeat predominance.",
          "They further argue that even if NADA and KBB were theoretically permissible methods of valuation under the policy, Progressive cannot defeat commonality or predominance by invoking hypothetical alternative methods it never employed. According to plaintiffs, it is legally improper to justify an actual underpayment under one methodology (Mitchell with PSA) by pointing to other methods that, if used, might have led to lower payments for some insureds. They characterize Progressive\u2019s defense as a \"relative privation\" argument and cite authority that injury is not negated simply because a different, worse valuation method might have been used. Under Arizona law, they argue, breach and bad faith are evaluated based on what the insurer actually did, not on hypothetical conduct.",
          "Plaintiffs also invoke the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Arizona law, emphasizing that insurers owe duties of fairness and equal consideration. They contend that Progressive\u2019s alleged practice of applying an artificial, non-market-based negotiation-type deduction is inconsistent with those duties and that whether this practice violates the covenant presents a class-wide question. They rely on Arizona cases indicating that good-faith claims arising from uniform practices can raise issues common to all members of a proposed class.",
          "On the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance requirement, plaintiffs argue that the district court improperly elevated individualized damages and valuation comparisons over the central, common questions of contract interpretation and the legality of Progressive\u2019s uniform PSA methodology. They maintain that predominance does not require every element of liability and damages to be established through common proof, and that under Olean Wholesale, a class may include some uninjured members so long as common issues do not get overwhelmed. They assert that because the PSA and policy language are uniform, the key liability questions can be resolved on a class-wide basis, and any subsequent individualized damages determinations can be managed without defeating certification.",
          "They distinguish Lara by noting that the adjustment at issue there concerned failure to itemize a condition adjustment under state regulation and did not involve a facially one-sided methodology embedded in the valuation process itself. In contrast, plaintiffs argue that Progressive\u2019s PSA is structurally downward-only and inherently incompatible with the contractual requirement to determine ACV based on market value. They analogize their case to Jama, where a uniform, statutorily prohibited \"negotiation\" adjustment could be addressed by adding back the unlawful deduction on a class-wide basis, and contend that the same logic applies here: if the PSA is found to be contractually impermissible, injury can be measured by restoring the deducted PSA for all class members.",

          "Progressive argues that its Arizona Auto Policy obligates it to pay the ACV of a totaled vehicle, but that the policy language does not prescribe a specific valuation methodology or forbid the use of a PSA. The contract defines ACV as determined by \"the market value, age, and condition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs,\" and, according to Progressive, this language affords reasonable discretion in selecting valuation tools and adjustments so long as they aim to approximate market value. Progressive asserts that the PSA is a legitimate means of reflecting the common reality that used vehicles often sell for less than their listed prices and is therefore consistent with, not contrary to, the policy\u2019s definition of ACV.",
          "They contend that there is nothing in Arizona law or in the policy language that facially prohibits the PSA. Unlike the explicitly barred \"negotiation adjustment\" in Jama, Progressive maintains that no statute or regulation categorically forbids a projected sold adjustment. Accordingly, in Progressive\u2019s view, the legitimacy of the PSA cannot be resolved by a simple, class-wide determination that the adjustment is unlawful on its face. Instead, whether the PSA results in an underpayment for any given insured depends on the actual pre-loss market value of that specific vehicle, which is inherently individualized.",
          "Progressive emphasizes that, under Arizona law, a breach of contract claim requires proof of contract, breach, and resulting damages. They argue that plaintiffs must show not only that the PSA was used but that its use caused an underpayment relative to the actual ACV of each vehicle. Since the policy obligates Progressive to pay only the ACV, not some higher benchmark, any putative class member who received payments at or above their vehicle\u2019s true ACV suffered no injury and cannot prevail on a breach claim. Progressive maintains that determining whether any particular insured was underpaid requires a vehicle-by-vehicle comparison between the amount actually paid and a fact-specific estimate of that vehicle\u2019s actual market value at the time of loss.",
          "In support of the need for individualized inquiries, Progressive points to evidence that at least two proposed class members received higher market-value assessments in the Mitchell Reports (even with the PSA applied) than they would have under other recognized valuation sources. Progressive contends that it has a due process right to present such individualized defenses and that the necessity of litigating these comparisons for each class member would result in claim-by-claim adjudication, defeating predominance. They rely on cases recognizing that when individualized proof of an essential element of liability is needed, class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is inappropriate.",
          "Progressive further argues that standard appraisal practice involves using nationally recognized valuation guides such as NADA and KBB as part of determining market value. They cite record evidence that a market value appraisal often begins by consulting these guides and assert that they represent permissible, contractually consistent methods of estimating ACV. From this, Progressive contends that a proper analysis of whether any class member was injured must consider not only what the Mitchell Report with PSA produced, but also what other acceptable valuation methods might have yielded for that individual vehicle. In their view, if an alternative, contract-compliant method such as NADA or KBB would have produced an equal or lower valuation, then the insured cannot show damages from use of the PSA.",
          "On class certification, Progressive does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that Rule 23(a) was satisfied but maintains that Rule 23(b)(3) predominance is lacking. Citing Lara and other circuit precedent, Progressive argues that when the central question of injury turns on whether each person\u2019s settlement met or exceeded ACV, the necessary individualized valuations overwhelm any common questions about the insurer\u2019s methodology. Progressive asserts that, as in Lara, plaintiffs here cannot establish injury on a class-wide basis simply by pointing to the presence of an adjustment in the valuation report, because the insurer\u2019s contractual duty is only to pay ACV, and many insureds may have received that amount or more despite the adjustment.",
          "Progressive distinguishes Jama by emphasizing that the adjustment at issue there was prohibited by Washington law on its face, allowing class-wide injury to be measured simply by undoing that specific deduction. They contend that because the PSA is not facially unlawful, plaintiffs must prove that the use of the PSA actually produced underpayments for specific insureds, which cannot be done through common proof alone. Progressive also relies on authority recognizing that a defendant may introduce individualized evidence to show that some class members were not harmed and that, where this evidence raises the prospect of extensive individual inquiries into liability and damages, it undermines the cohesiveness necessary for a Rule 23(b)(3) class.",
          "Finally, Progressive points to other appellate decisions that have reversed class certifications challenging its PSA methodology, arguing that those decisions confirm that under similar policy language and legal frameworks, individual issues related to ACV and damages predominate. Progressive maintains that, consistent with these authorities, the district court correctly concluded that the proposed class would require extensive, member-specific adjudications of value and injury, making class treatment unsuitable."

Nothing in Arizona law clearly transforms that ACV promise into a single, class\u2011wide methodological duty whose breach can be determined without examining whether each insured actually received less than ACV. Given the absence of a statutory or regulatory prohibition on the PSA (unlike the negotiation adjustment in Jama), the district court reasonably treated the propriety of the PSA as intertwined with whether it produced sub\u2011ACV payments on a claim\u2011by\u2011claim basis. On de novo review, the panel is likely to agree that the contract language leaves room for multiple valuation tools and that breach cannot be decided purely at the level of methodology, making the court\u2019s legal framing of the duty and its connection to individualized proof acceptable."

The district court accepted that the existence and operation of the PSA are common issues but focused on whether injury (underpayment below ACV) could be proven class\u2011wide. Because ACV is inherently vehicle\u2011specific and the policy only requires payment of ACV\u2014not the Mitchell number without PSA\u2014the court concluded that determining breach and damages would require individualized valuation of each vehicle, including consideration that some insureds may have received at least ACV even after the PSA. Under Ninth Circuit guidance (including Lara), individualized injury questions that go to an essential element of liability can defeat predominance even if some common methodology issues exist. The court did not treat damages alone as defeating predominance; it found that liability itself could not be established through common proof.

Under Rule 23, defendants may point to such individualized liability defenses to show that common questions will not predominate. The court permissibly used the existence of these alternative, recognized valuation benchmarks to underscore the need for member\u2011by\u2011member proof of ACV and injury. There is no clear legal bar to considering methods Progressive did not actually apply, because the core question at trial will be whether each plaintiff was paid at least ACV, not whether Progressive could have done worse.

Plaintiffs frame the PSA as inherently invalid and thus facially injurious, but unlike Jama there is no statute or regulation categorically outlawing such an adjustment. The policy standard is ACV, not the unadjusted Mitchell figure. Thus, even if the PSA is always applied in one direction, it is not automatically overbroad in every individual case; an insured could still receive at least ACV after the adjustment. Establishing actual breach and damages would require showing that the PSA drove the payment below the true ACV for each claim. The district court reasonably concluded that the PSA\u2019s uniformity did not convert liability and injury into purely common issues, because its alleged unlawfulness depends on whether it resulted in sub\u2011ACV payments in fact.

Lara involved a valuation adjustment where injury depended on whether each insured\u2019s ultimate payment was below ACV and the adjustment was not facially unlawful. The Ninth Circuit there emphasized the need for individualized proof of ACV and upheld denial of certification. Jama, by contrast, involved a negotiation adjustment explicitly prohibited by state law, so injury could be measured class\u2011wide by adding back a categorically unlawful deduction. The PSA here more closely resembles the condition adjustment in Lara than the illegal negotiation adjustment in Jama: there is no Arizona law that facially invalidates the PSA; its alleged impropriety depends on its effect on actual ACV payments. The district court\u2019s reliance on Lara\u2019s reasoning\u2014that presence of an adjustment in a uniform methodology is not enough to prove injury class\u2011wide when the contract only promises ACV\u2014and its distinction of Jama are consistent with Ninth Circuit precedent.

      "reasoning":"The only order on appeal is the denial of Rule 23(b)(3) class certification. The district court already found Rule 23(a) satisfied and focused solely on predominance. Under Ninth Circuit law, predominance turns on whether liability and injury can be shown through common proof or whether individualized determinations overwhelm common issues. Here, the contract requires payment of ACV, a fact\u2011intensive, vehicle\u2011specific figure. The PSA is not expressly barred by Arizona statute or regulation, and the policy does not mandate any particular valuation methodology. That places the case within the Lara paradigm, where the use of a uniform valuation adjustment did not, by itself, establish class\u2011wide injury because each plaintiff still had to show payment below ACV. Jama is distinguishable because there the adjustment itself was facially unlawful, allowing injury to be proven by a mechanical add\u2011back. The district court treated the PSA as potentially permissible in some applications and held that showing breach and damages would require comparing each insured\u2019s payout to that vehicle\u2019s true ACV, possibly informed by alternative valuation benchmarks. That conclusion\u2014that individual liability and injury issues predominate\u2014is within the broad discretion accorded to trial courts in class certification. There is no clear legal misinterpretation of the policy or Rule 23 that would require reversal, and the reliance on alternative valuation evidence to show individualized defenses is permissible.

It owns a U.S. trademark registration for the \"Nature\u2019s Way\" mark for use on nutritional supplements. Doctor\u2019s Best, Inc. (DB) is a competing nutritional supplement company. DB developed a new line of supplements branded as \"Nature\u2019s Day.\" These Nature\u2019s Day products are manufactured in Tustin, California, and the goods bear English\u2011language labels that include the Nature\u2019s Day word mark and design, along with information required by U.S. regulations such as a Food and Drug Administration disclaimer. According to DB, the Nature\u2019s Day labels, including the word mark and design, were independently created by a third party in China for use in Asian markets and were not based on NWP\u2019s marks. DB represents that it does not intend to sell or market Nature\u2019s Day products to end consumers in the United States through any channel. Instead, DB sells and markets Nature\u2019s Day supplements exclusively outside the United States, specifically in China, South Korea, and Taiwan. DB asserts that it manufactures the products in the United States and uses English\u2011language, U.S.\u2011compliant labeling because foreign consumers perceive U.S.\u2011made goods as high\u2011quality and safe, and because U.S. law requires U.S.\u2011manufactured products to comply with U.S. labeling rules even when they are sold abroad. DB owns an international trademark registration for the Nature\u2019s Day mark. In 2022, DB filed an intent\u2011to\u2011use application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking registration of the Nature\u2019s Day mark for nutritional supplements in the United States. After learning of this application, NWP sent DB a cease\u2011and\u2011desist letter identifying NWP\u2019s ownership of the Nature\u2019s Way mark and asserting superior rights in that mark.",

NWP\u2019s counterclaim alleged that DB\u2019s use of the Nature\u2019s Day mark infringed NWP\u2019s Nature\u2019s Way mark.",
        "district_court_decision":"After the parties held their Rule 26(f) scheduling conference, discovery opened in September 2023. The district court set June 6, 2024 as the discovery cutoff and August 5, 2024 as the dispositive motion hearing deadline. In late December 2023, about five months before the close of discovery, Doctor\u2019s Best informed Nature\u2019s Way Products that it intended to move for summary judgment on non\u2011infringement. On January 22, 2024, DB moved for summary judgment. By that point, neither party had served formal discovery requests; DB instead relied on declarations from its executives in support of its motion. NWP opposed the motion and also filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), asking the district court to deny or defer ruling on DB\u2019s summary judgment motion to permit additional discovery. In support of the Rule 56(d) motion, NWP\u2019s counsel submitted a declaration identifying categories of facts NWP wished to obtain through discovery, asserting those facts were essential to opposing summary judgment, and stating on information and belief that such facts existed. When NWP filed its opposition and Rule 56(d) motion, it had not yet served any discovery requests; it served its first written discovery requests only after filing its opposition. The district court denied NWP\u2019s Rule 56(d) motion, reasoning that NWP had not provided a sufficient basis to conclude that the facts it sought actually existed and had not diligently pursued discovery. The court then granted DB\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in DB\u2019s favor. In its merits ruling, the court applied the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in Abitron Austria GmbH v. Hetronic International, Inc., which held that the Lanham Act\u2019s trademark infringement provisions are not extraterritorial and apply only to claims where the infringing \"use in commerce\" is domestic. The district court found that DB\u2019s U.S. conduct related to Nature\u2019s Day was limited to manufacturing, bottling, labeling, and transporting the products in the United States, with all sales and marketing directed to foreign consumers. The court concluded that, under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127, the domestic transport of Nature\u2019s Day products in U.S. commerce constituted an actionable domestic \"use in commerce\" for Lanham Act purposes, while DB\u2019s foreign sales and marketing were outside the statute\u2019s territorial reach. The court then analyzed whether DB\u2019s actionable domestic conduct\u2014specifically its transport of the Nature\u2019s Day products in the United States\u2014was likely to cause consumer confusion under the Lanham Act. Applying the Sleekcraft likelihood\u2011of\u2011confusion factors, the court focused on what it deemed the most pertinent considerations in light of the absence of U.S. sales or marketing of Nature\u2019s Day: (1) the lack of evidence of actual consumer confusion; (2) the evidence that Nature\u2019s Way and Nature\u2019s Day products used different marketing channels, with NWP marketing and selling Nature\u2019s Way products throughout the U.S. and DB not advertising or selling Nature\u2019s Day products to U.S. consumers or via U.S. e\u2011commerce platforms; and (3) the absence of evidence showing a strong possibility that DB would expand Nature\u2019s Day sales or marketing into the U.S. market. The court deemed the remaining Sleekcraft factors (strength of the mark, proximity of the goods, similarity of the marks, consumer care, and defendant\u2019s intent) relatively less relevant given that Nature\u2019s Day products had no sales, advertising, or other interaction with U.S. consumers and that DB sold and advertised Nature\u2019s Day only abroad. The court concluded that the summary judgment record showed no genuine dispute of material fact that DB\u2019s domestic use of the Nature\u2019s Day mark in the course of transporting the products in commerce was not likely to cause consumer confusion, and therefore found that NWP could not establish trademark infringement under the Lanham Act on the record presented.",

NWP argues that under Abitron, once a domestic \"use in commerce\" is identified, that domestic use creates a sufficient nexus with the United States such that the likelihood\u2011of\u2011confusion analysis can proceed without being limited to domestic confusion, and evidence of confusion abroad should remain relevant.",

NWP asserts that this misinterpretation unduly restricted its infringement claim.",

NWP maintains that these factors demonstrate at least a triable factual issue about confusion arising from DB\u2019s use of the Nature\u2019s Day mark.",

NWP argues that this improperly minimized factors that should have been weighed in the likelihood\u2011of\u2011confusion analysis and that a reasonable jury could find confusion when all factors are properly considered.",

According to DB, NWP\u2019s Rule 56(d) showing was insufficient because NWP relied on counsel\u2019s statements on information and belief and speculative assertions about what discovery might reveal, rather than concrete facts, and failed to show that the sought\u2011after evidence actually existed or would create a genuine issue of material fact."

NWP pointed to mark strength, similarity, and relatedness of goods, but did not produce evidence that U.S. consumers are likely to encounter Nature\u2019s Day at all in the United States, much less in a context overlapping with Nature\u2019s Way. Its arguments about globally accessible e\u2011commerce sites and potential future expansion are speculative and do not create a genuine issue that U.S. consumers are likely to be confused by DB\u2019s domestic transport activities. The district court permissibly treated channel overlap, lack of actual confusion, and lack of concrete evidence of expansion as dispositive, and it did not commit legal error by according less weight to other Sleekcraft factors in light of the absence of U.S. consumer exposure.

By the time NWP filed its Rule 56(d) motion, the case had been pending roughly nine months, discovery had been open for several months, and DB had given advance notice of its intent to seek summary judgment. Yet NWP had served no discovery requests before opposing the motion and only did so after filing its opposition and Rule 56(d) request. Its showing consisted largely of counsel\u2019s declaration on information and belief describing categories of desired discovery and speculating that they would yield favorable evidence; it did not identify concrete evidence likely to exist or explain why that information could not have been sought earlier. Under Ninth Circuit precedent, such a speculative and belated showing supports denial of Rule 56(d) relief. Given the extended opportunity NWP already had to initiate discovery and the lack of specific, non\u2011conclusory support for the belief that additional discovery would create a material factual dispute, the district court\u2019s decision falls well within the permissible range and is unlikely to be deemed an abuse of discretion."

That comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s directive and leaves little room for reversible legal error. On likelihood of confusion, once the actionable conduct is confined to domestic transport of goods never sold or advertised to U.S. consumers, the essential Sleekcraft considerations\u2014particularly marketing channels, actual confusion, and likelihood of expansion\u2014strongly disfavor a finding of likely confusion. NWP\u2019s reliance on mark strength and similarity cannot, on this record, overcome the absence of any realistic U.S. consumer exposure to Nature\u2019s Day, and its assertions about e\u2011commerce and future expansion are speculative. Summary judgment is therefore sustainable on de novo review. Finally, as to Rule 56(d), NWP\u2019s lack of diligence in propounding discovery before opposing summary judgment and its generalized, speculative showing about what discovery might reveal make it unlikely that an appellate court would find an abuse of discretion in denying additional time.

      "factual_background":"On November 7, 2018, Guistina Aprileo contacted law enforcement to report a disturbance at her home involving her adult children. Officers Jason Bacis and Thalia Castro were the first to respond and were able to de-escalate the dispute. A third officer, Richard Ward, then arrived at the scene. Aprileo told Ward that his presence was no longer needed. According to Ward, as he was exiting her home, Aprileo pushed him. When Ward attempted to place Aprileo in handcuffs, she allegedly pulled away. Ward then used a 'forced arm bar' maneuver to bring Aprileo to the ground and arrested her. During this arrest, Aprileo\u2019s elbow was fractured.\n\nAprileo was criminally charged in Massachusetts state court with resisting arrest (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, \u00a7 32B), disorderly conduct (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, \u00a7 53), and assault and battery on a police officer (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, \u00a7 13D). She never entered a plea to these charges. Instead, on January 29, 2020, she and the Commonwealth executed an agreement that the charges would be dismissed after she completed three months of pretrial probation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, \u00a7 87. Her conditions of probation were to obey all laws and court orders, notify the probation department of any change in contact information, and make no false statements to court officers.\n\nThis arrangement was made pursuant to \u00a7 87, which allows a court, with the defendant\u2019s consent and before trial and before a guilty plea, to place a person charged with an offense on probation under conditions set by the court. Section 87 also authorizes probation in cases after a finding or verdict of guilty, but Aprileo\u2019s case proceeded under the pretrial component of the statute. To memorialize the pretrial probation agreement, a form titled 'TENDER OF PLEA OR ADMISSION & WAIVER OF RIGHTS' was signed by Aprileo, the prosecutor, and the state court judge. The form contained boxes for 'GUILTY PLEA,' 'ADMISSION TO FACTS SUFFICIENT FOR A FINDING OF GUILTY,' and 'BINDING PLEA WITH CHARGE CONCESSION UNDER RULE 12(b)(5)(A),' but none of these boxes were checked. Aprileo did not admit to any facts in connection with the criminal charges, either on that form or otherwise, and the state court made no factual findings regarding her guilt. After she successfully completed the three-month pretrial probation, the Commonwealth dismissed all charges against her.\n\nMassachusetts case law cited in the opinion describes dismissal of charges following pretrial probation under \u00a7 87 as not constituting a conviction or its functional equivalent and as not requiring a guilty plea or admission to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt.",

Her claims included causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging civil rights violations connected to her November 2018 arrest. Specifically, she alleged that Officer Ward used excessive force during the arrest, fracturing her elbow, and that Officers Bacis and Castro failed to intervene to prevent Ward\u2019s use of excessive force. She also asserted claims against the City of Springfield (and, as pled, the department and commissioner) premised on municipal or supervisory liability theories.",

As relevant here, the court concluded that the Heck doctrine does not bar Aprileo\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against Officers Ward and Castro because her underlying state criminal case was dismissed without a conviction.

The district court granted certification and framed the certified question as: 'Does the Heck doctrine apply to a federal civil rights claim when the underlying criminal charges were dismissed after successful completion of pretrial probation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, \u00a7 87?' The officers then filed a petition for permission to appeal, which the Court of Appeals granted.

Heck bars \u00a7 1983 claims that, if successful, would necessarily imply the invalidity of an outstanding and otherwise valid criminal judgment (a conviction or sentence). Later, in Wallace v.

They rely on decisions from other circuits, such as Gilles v. Davis and DeLeon v.

Laws ch. 276, \u00a7 87, followed by dismissal of the charges, does not constitute a conviction or its functional equivalent under Massachusetts law, citing state precedent holding that dismissal following pretrial probation is not a conviction and does not establish guilt in any fashion. Because there is no outstanding criminal judgment, she maintains that her \u00a7 1983 claims cannot 'render a conviction or sentence invalid' and thus do not fall within the category of cases governed by Heck.",
          "Aprileo further submits that the three elements sometimes associated with Heck\u2019s application \u2014 (1) an existing conviction or sentence, (2) that has not been invalidated (i.e., the criminal proceeding did not end in the defendant\u2019s favor), and (3) a civil claim that would necessarily imply the invalidity of that conviction or sentence \u2014 confirm that the absence of any conviction or sentence is dispositive in her case. She characterizes the existence of a conviction or sentence as an antecedent requirement: if that requirement is not satisfied, courts need not reach questions of favorable termination or inconsistency between the civil and criminal results.",
          "She also argues that the policy concerns underlying Heck do not apply here because her criminal case ended in a dismissal without any adjudication of guilt, so there is no risk of conflicting judgments or improper collateral attack on a state criminal conviction. She points to the majority of other federal appellate courts that have declined to apply Heck in circumstances where criminal charges were dismissed after pretrial diversion or probation arrangements, distinguishing the authorities relied upon by the officers and noting that more recent Supreme Court precedent on favorable termination in malicious prosecution claims undercuts those authorities."

The officers\u2019 request to treat this diversionary disposition as a \u2018functional\u2019 conviction conflicts with Wallace\u2019s bright-line requirement of an actual conviction or sentence, and Thompson v.

Kato states that Heck is \u2018called into play only when there exists a conviction or sentence that has not been invalidated,\u2019 and the Massachusetts authorities described in the summary squarely hold that \u00a7 87 pretrial probation leading to dismissal is not a conviction or its equivalent. The officers\u2019 functional-equivalence argument and reliance on older or contrary circuit cases are weakened by Wallace and Thompson v. Clark\u2019s emphasis that proceedings ending without a conviction count as favorable terminations in the closely related malicious-prosecution framework. Because there is no criminal judgment that a civil judgment could impugn, there is no Heck bar. The district court\u2019s decision to allow the \u00a7 1983 excessive-force and failure-to-intervene claims against Ward and Castro to proceed is therefore correctly affirmed in full on this interlocutory appeal."

      "factual_background":"Yuga Labs, Inc. created and launched the \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\" (BAYC) nonfungible token (NFT) collection using a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The BAYC collection consists of 10,000 NFTs, each associated with a distinct cartoon \"Bored Ape\" image and a unique \"Ape ID.\" Yuga began selling BAYC NFTs in April 2021, sold out the collection by the following month at an average price of about $200 per NFT, and made over $2 million in the initial offering.\n\nUnder Yuga\u2019s Terms and Conditions (T&Cs), purchasers of BAYC NFTs obtained ownership of the NFT and a broad license to \"the underlying Bored Ape, the Art, completely,\" including both personal and commercial rights to use the associated artwork, free of royalty fees. Each BAYC NFT also functioned as a membership pass to an exclusive online and offline social club, giving holders access to interactive digital spaces, branded merchandise, and events, some featuring well-known musical performers. Media described the BAYC community as a blend of gated online community, shareholder-like group, and art appreciation society. BAYC gained substantial press and celebrity attention, and some BAYC NFTs resold for very high prices on the secondary market, including auction sales reported as high as $24.4 million. Yuga earned a 2.5% royalty on secondary-market sales and engaged in collaborations with companies such as Adidas, placing BAYC-related marks on clothing and consumer goods. Yuga invested significant resources in developing and protecting its brand.\n\nIn promoting its products and services, including the BAYC NFTs, Yuga used various brand signifiers it refers to collectively as the \"BAYC Marks\": the phrases \"BORED APE YACHT CLUB,\" \"BAYC,\" \"BORED APE,\" the BAYC Logo, the BAYC BORED APE YACHT CLUB Logo, and the Ape Skull Logo. The parties dispute whether these signifiers qualify as valid trademarks under the Lanham Act.\n\nDefendant Ryder Ripps is a visual and conceptual artist who describes his work as blurring the boundaries between art, the internet, and commerce, and as critiquing online power structures and the attention economy. In late 2021, Ripps began publicly criticizing Yuga, accusing it of using neo\u2011Nazi symbolism, alt\u2011right signals, and racist imagery in its BAYC branding and NFTs. He made these criticisms in interviews with journalists, on social media and podcasts, and on a website he created, gordongoner.com, named after the online handle of a BAYC co\u2011creator. On that site, he compiled materials and used art and imagery to satirize the BAYC brand and to argue that BAYC imagery contained Nazi references, including claims that the BAYC ape skull logo resembled the Nazi SS Totenkopf emblem.\n\nIn May 2022, Ripps and Jeremy Cahen partnered to create a new NFT collection called \"Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club\" (RR\/BAYC). The RR\/BAYC NFTs are linked to the same ape images and the same Ape IDs as the corresponding BAYC NFTs, such that each RR\/BAYC NFT corresponds visually and numerically to a BAYC NFT. Ripps initially minted RR\/BAYC NFTs using the Foundation NFT marketplace and ultimately embedded the collection in a separate Ethereum smart contract, with its own contract address, creator information, metadata, and dates. When he configured the smart contract, Ripps set the contract name to \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\" and the contract symbol to \"BAYC\" for the RR\/BAYC NFTs. These identifiers are built into the NFTs and cannot be changed.\n\nMetadata for NFTs stored on Ethereum smart contracts is accessible through blockchain-explorer tools such as Etherscan. These tools track NFT transactions and list metadata, including contract names and symbols, and can be used by customers and automated services (including bots) to verify provenance. According to Yuga, nothing in the RR\/BAYC smart contract or the NFTs directed users to any disclaimers that the RR\/BAYC NFTs were \"fakes\" or to any commentary about Yuga or BAYC, and the similarity of metadata between BAYC and RR\/BAYC NFTs led Etherscan and automated tracking tools to identify RR\/BAYC NFTs with Yuga\u2019s marks and to report some RR\/BAYC sales as BAYC sales.\n\nRipps and Cahen created and operated the website rrbayc.com to promote and sell RR\/BAYC NFTs. On rrbayc.com, potential buyers could \"reserve\" an RR\/BAYC NFT by selecting an Ape ID corresponding to a BAYC NFT. The site included an \"artist statement\" describing the project as a new mint of BAYC imagery intended for educational, protest, and satirical purposes, and it linked to gordongoner.com, which contained Ripps\u2019s criticisms of BAYC as racist and as an example of \"simianization\"\u2014degrading people by comparing them to apes.\n\nDefendants sold RR\/BAYC NFTs primarily through rrbayc.com and, to a lesser extent, via Twitter. RR\/BAYC NFTs sold in a range of approximately $100 to $200 each, and defendants sold out their entire RR\/BAYC collection, earning over $1.36 million from primary sales. RR\/BAYC NFTs were also resold on secondary NFT marketplaces, including Foundation, where a RR\/BAYC collection page displayed \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\" in large type, identified user \"@ryder_ripps\" in significantly smaller type, used the acronym \"BAYC,\" and displayed Yuga\u2019s Ape Skull logo. At least one other secondary marketplace also listed RR\/BAYC NFTs under the \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\" name. Defendants promoted these secondary-market listings on their personal Twitter accounts, linking to marketplace pages that used BAYC names, logos, and acronyms, and sharing the RR\/BAYC artist statement. Defendants earned more than $100,000 in royalties from secondary-market RR\/BAYC sales. In late June 2022, several marketplaces, including Foundation, removed RR\/BAYC listings after receiving takedown notices from Yuga.\n\nDefendants additionally registered the domain name apemarket.com with the intent to operate a marketplace where BAYC and RR\/BAYC NFTs would be listed side\u2011by\u2011side. They previewed the planned \"ApeMarket\" platform on social media, created a dedicated ApeMarket Twitter account stating it would launch within 24 hours of the final RR\/BAYC mint, and directed some promotional messages to the \"Yuga Community.\" ApeMarket never launched; the project was halted after Yuga filed this lawsuit.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In June 2022, Yuga Labs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen. Yuga asserted eleven causes of action under federal and state law: (1) trademark infringement based on a false\u2011designation\u2011of\u2011origin theory under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a); (2) false advertising under \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act; (3) cybersquatting under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(d); (4) common\u2011law trademark infringement; (5) common\u2011law unfair competition; (6) unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200 et seq.; (7) false advertising under California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17500 et seq.; (8) unjust enrichment; (9) conversion; (10) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; and (11) negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.\n\nDefendants answered and asserted multiple defenses, including: that Yuga lacked enforceable trademark rights; that any use of the BAYC marks by defendants was protected by nominative fair use; and that their conduct was protected by the First Amendment. Defendants also filed counterclaims: (1) knowing misrepresentation of infringing activity under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(f), based on Yuga\u2019s takedown notices; (2) declaratory judgment that Yuga held no copyright in the Bored Ape images under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 204(a); (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) negligent infliction of emotional distress; and (5) declaratory judgment of no defamation. Defendants filed an anti\u2011SLAPP motion under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 425.16 and a motion to dismiss Yuga\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe district court denied defendants\u2019 anti\u2011SLAPP motion and their motion to dismiss, except that it dismissed Yuga\u2019s unjust\u2011enrichment claim. In denying these motions, the district court rejected defendants\u2019 arguments that Yuga\u2019s claims arose from protected free\u2011speech activity and rejected their First Amendment and fair\u2011use defenses at the pleading stage. Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal of the anti\u2011SLAPP ruling. The Ninth Circuit, in an unpublished decision, affirmed the denial of the anti\u2011SLAPP motion, holding that Yuga\u2019s claims did not arise from acts taken in furtherance of Ripps\u2019s free\u2011speech rights.\n\nIn March 2023, Yuga moved for summary judgment on three issues: its Lanham Act false\u2011designation\u2011of\u2011origin claim, its ACPA cybersquatting claim, and defendants\u2019 DMCA counterclaim, and also sought summary adjudication on defendants\u2019 related defenses. The district court granted summary judgment for Yuga. On the trademark claim, the court found that Yuga owned unregistered BAYC marks, that defendants\u2019 use of those marks was likely to cause consumer confusion, and that defendants intentionally infringed Yuga\u2019s marks. On the ACPA claim, the court concluded that defendants\u2019 registered domains, including rrbayc.com and apemarket.com, were confusingly similar to Yuga\u2019s marks and that defendants acted with bad-faith intent to profit. On the DMCA counterclaim, the court ruled that there was no triable issue that Yuga had knowingly and materially misrepresented infringement in its takedown notices.\n\nAfter the summary\u2011judgment ruling and a pretrial conference, Yuga voluntarily dismissed its Lanham Act false\u2011advertising claim and all state\u2011law claims, and withdrew its demand for legal (monetary) damages, including previously claimed damages up to roughly $800 million. Yuga chose to proceed solely on equitable remedies associated with its remaining federal trademark\u2011infringement and ACPA cybersquatting claims.\n\nThe district court then held a one\u2011day bench trial limited to remedies. The court took testimony and argument on: (1) whether Yuga was entitled to disgorgement of defendants\u2019 profits and, if so, the amount; (2) the amount of statutory damages under the ACPA; (3) the scope of a permanent injunction; and (4) whether the case was \"exceptional\" under the Lanham Act and ACPA so as to justify an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court found that the BAYC Marks were unregistered trademarks that Yuga had used since approximately April 2021 in nationwide and international advertising, marketing, and promotion of its products and services via the BAYC website and other platforms. The court awarded Yuga disgorgement of defendants\u2019 profits, statutory damages at the maximum level available under the ACPA, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs based in part on its view that the case was exceptional due to the strength of Yuga\u2019s litigation position and defendants\u2019 willful infringement, bad\u2011faith intent to profit, and litigation conduct. The court also entered a permanent injunction barring defendants from marketing, promoting, or selling products or services, including RR\/BAYC NFTs and the proposed ApeMarket, that used the BAYC Marks.\n\nThe district court further addressed defendants\u2019 counterclaims. It granted summary judgment in favor of Yuga on the DMCA \u00a7 512(f) counterclaim, concluding that the record did not establish knowing or material misrepresentation in the cited takedown notices. The court dismissed defendants\u2019 declaratory\u2011judgment counterclaims concerning Yuga\u2019s copyright rights (and associated requests for declarations) for lack of subject\u2011matter jurisdiction, and did so with prejudice, reasoning that there was no live case or controversy regarding copyright ownership or enforcement because Yuga had not registered any relevant copyrights.\n\nDefendants then appealed from the district court\u2019s summary\u2011judgment order, the remedial orders following the bench trial, and the dismissal of their declaratory\u2011judgment counterclaims.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court (1) denied defendants' anti\u2011SLAPP motion and largely denied their motion to dismiss, except for dismissing Yuga's unjust\u2011enrichment claim; (2) rejected defendants\u2019 First Amendment and fair\u2011use defenses at the motion\u2011to\u2011dismiss stage; (3) granted summary judgment for Yuga on its Lanham Act false\u2011designation\u2011of\u2011origin (trademark\u2011infringement) claim and its ACPA cybersquatting claim; (4) granted summary judgment for Yuga on defendants\u2019 DMCA \u00a7 512(f) counterclaim; (5) held a bench trial limited to equitable remedies on the two remaining federal claims and awarded Yuga disgorgement of defendants\u2019 profits, maximum statutory damages under the ACPA, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and entered a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from marketing, promoting, or selling products or services using the BAYC Marks, including RR\/BAYC NFTs and the proposed ApeMarket; and (6) dismissed defendants\u2019 declaratory\u2011judgment counterclaims concerning Yuga\u2019s copyrights with prejudice for lack of subject\u2011matter jurisdiction.",

          "legal_standard":"Lanham Act \u00a7 43(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)(1), prohibits use in commerce of a mark likely to cause confusion as to the origin of goods or services. To prevail on a trademark\u2011infringement claim based on false designation of origin, a plaintiff must show: (1) a valid, protectable mark; and (2) a likelihood of consumer confusion. Trademark priority generally belongs to the first user in commerce, but only \"lawful\" use can establish priority. Unlawful use must be sufficiently connected (a \"nexus\") to the use of the mark in commerce and be material to defeat protection. Ownership and assignment are evaluated under general trademark principles, including the requirement that goodwill accompany any valid assignment and that abandonment can occur through discontinued use with intent not to resume or by conduct causing a mark to lose its source\u2011identifying significance. Nominative fair use, as articulated in New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing and Toyota Motor Sales v. Tabari, applies when a defendant uses the plaintiff\u2019s mark to describe the plaintiff\u2019s product, not the defendant\u2019s own, and is analyzed under three factors: (1) whether the product is not readily identifiable without use of the mark; (2) whether only so much of the mark as reasonably necessary is used; and (3) whether the user does nothing that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement. Under Jack Daniel\u2019s Properties, Inc. v. VIP Products LLC, First Amendment\u2011based limits on trademark liability for expressive works (often analyzed under the Rogers test) do not apply when the accused use serves as a source identifier for the defendant\u2019s own goods. Likelihood of confusion is evaluated using the eight Sleekcraft factors: (1) strength of the mark; (2) proximity of the goods; (3) similarity of the marks; (4) evidence of actual confusion; (5) marketing channels used; (6) type of goods and degree of purchaser care; (7) defendant\u2019s intent; and (8) likelihood of product\u2011line expansion. Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."

Yuga denies any assignment of trademark rights via its T&Cs, explaining that the T&Cs address ownership and licensing of the underlying artwork and derivative works (copyright\u2011related concepts), not trademarks, and that nothing in the T&Cs transfers or licenses trademark rights or the associated goodwill to NFT purchasers. Yuga further contends that it has actively policed its marks, including by sending takedown notices regarding infringing uses, and that any unlicensed third\u2011party uses cited by defendants are isolated and insufficient to show abandonment, naked licensing, or genericide.",
          "Yuga argues that defendants\u2019 use of the BAYC Marks is classic trademark use, not nominative fair use. It emphasizes that defendants embedded the \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\" and \"BAYC\" marks as the contract name and symbol within their RR\/BAYC NFTs, used BAYC logos and names on social media and marketplace listings, and configured RR\/BAYC NFTs to point to the same artwork and Ape IDs as BAYC NFTs. According to Yuga, this is not merely referencing BAYC for commentary, but using BAYC marks as designations of source for a competing NFT collection, intending to attract buyers and trade on BAYC\u2019s goodwill.",
          "On the First Amendment issue, Yuga contends that the RR\/BAYC project does not fall within the limited expressive\u2011work exception recognized in Rogers and narrowed by Jack Daniel\u2019s because defendants used the BAYC Marks as source identifiers for their own goods. Yuga argues that even if defendants had expressive aims such as criticism and parody, the key legal question is whether the marks are used as designations of origin, and here defendants used BAYC names and logos in precisely that way to label and sell their own NFTs.",
          "Yuga maintains that the Sleekcraft factors support a finding of likelihood of confusion, and that the district court properly resolved that issue on summary judgment. It argues that the BAYC Marks are both conceptually and commercially strong; that the products (NFT collections) are highly proximate, particularly because RR\/BAYC NFTs are tied to the same images and Ape IDs; that defendants used nearly identical marks (including \"Bored Ape Yacht Club,\" \"BAYC,\" and BAYC logos) and confusingly similar domains; that evidence of actual confusion exists in the record in the form of survey data, bot reports, and public commentary; that both sides marketed NFTs through similar online channels and NFT marketplaces, as well as Twitter; that many NFT purchasers are not as sophisticated as defendants claim, and in any event sophisticated consumers may still be confused where marks and content are effectively identical; and that defendants intentionally adopted Yuga\u2019s marks and imagery in order to capitalize on BAYC\u2019s reputation and goodwill.",
          "Regarding the ACPA claim, Yuga asserts that rrbayc.com and apemarket.com are confusingly similar to its BAYC\u2011related marks. For rrbayc.com, Yuga emphasizes that the heart of the domain, \"bayc,\" is identical to its BAYC mark and domain, and that the \"rr\" prefix is insufficient to dispel confusion, especially where defendants\u2019 purpose was to parallel BAYC\u2019s branding. For apemarket.com, Yuga points to its \"BORED APE\" and other APE\u2011based marks and contends that the use of \"ape\" in the domain, combined with the NFT context and defendants\u2019 other uses, is likely to lead consumers to associate the domain with Yuga\u2019s ape\u2011branded offerings. Yuga also argues that ample evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding of bad\u2011faith intent to profit, including defendants\u2019 admitted knowledge of BAYC\u2019s fame, their decision to use similar branding, and their efforts to attract BAYC\u2019s audience.",
          "On the DMCA counterclaim, Yuga argues that the takedown notices relied on trademark infringement, not copyright, and that any references to the DMCA or \"DMCA Agent\" were either boilerplate or clerical and not materially relied upon by service providers. Yuga notes that the notices specifically listed Yuga\u2019s trademarks and complained of unauthorized use of those marks, passing off as official Yuga accounts, and potential consumer confusion. Yuga maintains that defendants lack evidence that the marketplaces removed RR\/BAYC content because of any alleged copyright claim as opposed to the clearly articulated trademark complaints, and therefore cannot show either a material misrepresentation or the requisite actual knowledge of falsity.",
          "As to declaratory\u2011judgment counterclaims, Yuga argues that the district court correctly found no live case or controversy over copyright ownership because Yuga had not registered any copyrights in the Bored Ape images and had not brought copyright claims. Yuga contends that, under these circumstances, dismissal with prejudice was within the court\u2019s discretion and does not preclude defendants from bringing a future declaratory\u2011judgment action if Yuga later registers copyrights and threatens or initiates enforcement. Yuga points out that a jurisdictional dismissal labeled \"with prejudice\" does not operate as an adjudication on the merits for res judicata purposes.",
          "On remedies, Yuga maintains that the equitable awards and injunction entered after the bench trial are proper so long as the underlying liability determinations stand. It argues that disgorgement of defendants\u2019 profits and statutory damages under the ACPA are permissible and supported by findings of willful infringement and bad\u2011faith cybersquatting; that the permanent injunction is appropriately tailored to prevent further misuse of Yuga\u2019s marks, including RR\/BAYC and ApeMarket; and that the case was properly deemed \"exceptional\" to justify attorneys\u2019 fees. Yuga disputes that there were any First Amendment or Seventh Amendment violations at the remedies stage because the relief requested and awarded was equitable in nature and the court followed traditional equitable principles."

          "reasoning":"The core liability questions on the Lanham Act claim are legal or mixed questions appropriate for summary judgment review de novo. The record, as summarized, strongly supports the district court\u2019s conclusions.\n\n(a) NFTs as \u201cgoods\u201d: The Lanham Act covers marks used on \u201cany goods or services.\u201d Courts and the PTO now routinely treat NFTs and related digital assets as goods. BAYC NFTs are discrete, tradable items functioning as passes and collectibles. There is no doctrinal basis to exclude them; defendants\u2019 argument would be an outlier and is unlikely to prevail.\n\n(b) Valid, protectable marks and priority: Yuga was first in use with the BAYC marks in nationwide commerce and invested in goodwill. The \u201cunlawful use\u201d defense based on alleged securities-law violations is too collateral to the source-identifying function of the marks to defeat priority; there is no tight nexus between any securities-registration issue and consumer protection in trademark law. The T&Cs granting buyers broad rights to the artwork do not expressly transfer trademark rights or goodwill, and standard principles bar finding an implied assignment of marks to 10,000 dispersed purchasers. Alleged failures to police or control quality are limited and contradicted by Yuga\u2019s actual enforcement efforts (takedowns etc.); that is insufficient as a matter of law to show abandonment, naked licensing, or genericide for relatively young, highly distinctive marks.\n\n(c) Nominative fair use: Defendants did far more than refer to BAYC to comment on it. They embedded \u201cBored Ape Yacht Club\u201d and \u201cBAYC\u201d as the contract name and symbol for their own NFTs, used the same images and Ape IDs, and marketed a parallel collection. That is classic source-identifying use of another\u2019s mark, not mere reference. They also used more of the marks than necessary (names, logos, domains), and the blockchain-level use affords no clear built-in disclaimer. Under New Kids\/Tabari, at least the second and third nominative-fair-use prongs are not satisfied.\n\n(d) First Amendment \/ Rogers-Jack Daniel\u2019s: After Jack Daniel\u2019s, the Rogers test does not shield uses where the defendant is using the plaintiff\u2019s mark \u201cas a mark\u201d to designate the source of its own goods. Here, RR\/BAYC NFTs are marketed as a separate collection; the BAYC marks identify that collection in commerce. Even if the project has expressive, critical aims, the challenged conduct is precisely the sort of source-identifying use Jack Daniel\u2019s leaves fully subject to ordinary trademark analysis. Thus, the First Amendment defense fails as a matter of law.\n\n(e) Likelihood of confusion: The undisputed facts strongly favor Yuga on Sleekcraft. The marks are conceptually and commercially strong; the goods are identical (competing BAYC-linked NFT collections); defendants used nearly identical marks and even the same artwork\/IDs; and channels of trade and marketing overlap (NFT marketplaces, Twitter, web sales). The defendant\u2019s intent was to appropriate BAYC\u2019s identifiers and audience, and Etherscan and bots actually misreported RR\/BAYC as BAYC, indicating real confusion. Sophistication does not overcome confusion when marks and content are essentially identical. Against this record, no reasonable factfinder could conclude an absence of likely confusion. Summary judgment on liability, including rejection of the nominative-fair-use and First Amendment defenses, is therefore properly affirmed."

          "reasoning":"The ACPA summary judgment ruling is reviewed de novo. The elements are clearly met on this record.\n\nThere is no dispute that defendants registered and used rrbayc.com and apemarket.com. BAYC is distinctive; defendants do not seriously undermine distinctiveness.\n\nFor rrbayc.com, the dominant portion of the domain is \u201cbayc,\u201d identical to Yuga\u2019s mark and domain except for the \u201crr\u201d prefix, which plausibly stands for Ryder Ripps. Minor additions rarely dispel confusing similarity under the ACPA, particularly where the addition is tailored to ride on the mark\u2019s fame. Given that the site sold NFTs mapped to BAYC images and defendants marketed directly to the Yuga community, the domain is confusingly similar as a matter of law.\n\nFor apemarket.com, Yuga\u2019s family of \u201cBored Ape\u201d and ape\u2011themed marks and its well-known association with \u201capes\u201d in the NFT context make \u201capemarket.com\u201d at least confusingly similar in this niche commercial space. That domain was conceived to host BAYC and RR\/BAYC NFTs side-by-side and was previewed to the same audience. The semantic overlap with Yuga\u2019s ape branding, in the NFT marketplace context, supports a finding of confusing similarity.\n\nBad-faith intent to profit is evidenced by: defendants\u2019 knowledge of BAYC\u2019s fame; deliberate selection of domains incorporating or evoking Yuga\u2019s marks; promotion to BAYC\u2019s community; and the commercial sale of RR\/BAYC NFTs mimicking BAYC. Their asserted protest motive does not negate that they earned over $1.4 million from the project and configured the domains to capitalize on BAYC\u2019s goodwill. On this record, a reasonable jury could not find a lack of bad faith, so summary judgment is properly affirmed."

          "reasoning":"Summary judgment on the \u00a7 512(f) counterclaim is reviewed de novo. Defendants must show a material misrepresentation in a DMCA notice and that Yuga knew the representation was false.\n\nThe summary describes Yuga\u2019s notices as grounded in trademark, not copyright: they identified Yuga\u2019s trademarks and complained of passing off and confusion. References to \u201cDMCA\u201d or a \u201cDMCA agent\u201d in online forms do not, by themselves, constitute a substantive copyright representation. Defendants\u2019 theory is that because Yuga lacked registered copyrights, any takedown under the DMCA was necessarily a knowing misrepresentation. But: (1) registration is not a prerequisite to owning copyright; and (2) more critically, the record here does not show that Yuga actually asserted copyright infringement as the basis of removal. If marketplaces acted on trademark-based complaints, any incidental DMCA labeling is not a material misrepresentation causing removal.\n\nUnder Rossi, the scienter standard is subjective actual knowledge or bad faith; mere legal error or negligence is not enough. Defendants\u2019 argument that Yuga \u201cshould have known\u201d it lacked a copyright basis is therefore insufficient. Because defendants have not identified evidence that Yuga knowingly made a false copyright claim that materially caused takedowns, there is no triable \u00a7 512(f) issue.

          "reasoning":"Whether an Article III controversy exists is reviewed de novo; the manner of dismissal is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n\nOn the merits of jurisdiction, the district court correctly found no actual copyright controversy. Yuga had not registered any Bored Ape copyrights and asserted no copyright claims. Defendants sought a declaratory judgment of non\u2011copyrightability in an essentially hypothetical dispute about future enforcement. Without registration or concrete enforcement threats, that is too speculative for Article III. Dismissal for lack of subject\u2011matter jurisdiction is therefore proper.\n\nAs to labeling the dismissal \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d Ninth Circuit law recognizes that a jurisdictional dismissal is by definition not on the merits and does not have claim\u2011preclusive effect, regardless of label. The court could reasonably intend only to close the existing action. Given that future enforcement, if any, would arise in a different factual posture (e.g., after registration or threats), there is no practical bar against a new declaratory\u2011judgment suit at that time. Using the phrase \u201cwith prejudice\u201d in this context, while arguably imprecise, does not constitute an abuse of discretion warranting reversal, because it neither rests on an erroneous legal premise nor imposes impermissible claim preclusion. Affirmance is therefore appropriate."

          "reasoning":"Remedies after a bench trial\u2014disgorgement, statutory damages selection within the ACPA range, injunction scope, and fee awards\u2014are reviewed for abuse of discretion, with factual findings reviewed for clear error.\n\nBecause the liability determinations on the Lanham Act and ACPA claims stand, there is no basis to vacate remedies on that ground.\n\nDisgorgement: The court awarded defendants\u2019 profits based on willful infringement and unjust enrichment. The record shows deliberate copying of marks and appropriation of BAYC goodwill. This is a classic case for disgorgement. The court was entitled to treat profits as a surrogate for damages and deterrence. There is no indication it exceeded statutory or equitable bounds.\n\nACPA statutory damages: The court selected the maximum within the statutory range, grounded in findings of willful, bad\u2011faith cybersquatting. Given the strong evidence of bad faith and the close mimicking of Yuga\u2019s marks, choosing the maximum is within its permissible discretion.\n\nPermanent injunction: The injunction bars defendants from marketing, promoting, or selling products or services using the BAYC marks, including RR\/BAYC and ApeMarket. It does not broadly prohibit criticism or discussion of Yuga; it targets infringing commercial uses. That is consistent with First Amendment limits and traditional equitable principles (irreparable harm, inadequacy of legal remedies, balance of hardships, public interest in avoiding confusion). The scope is tailored to stop misuse of the marks rather than silence protest.\n\nAttorneys\u2019 fees: In light of the willful infringement, bad\u2011faith cybersquatting, and litigation conduct, deeming the matter \u201cexceptional\u201d under \u00a7 1117 and \u00a7 1125(d) falls well within the range of reasonable outcomes.\n\nFirst and Seventh Amendment objections to remedies lack force. After Yuga withdrew legal damages and proceeded solely on equitable relief, there was no entitlement to a jury on profits or injunctive relief. The bench trial afforded due process. The First Amendment does not bar equitable relief against non\u2011expressive, source\u2011identifying misuse of marks. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion, and the remedial orders should be affirmed."

The undisputed facts show classic, willful, source\u2011identifying use of Yuga\u2019s marks to sell a parallel NFT collection and related domains, with documented confusion. That justifies summary judgment on Lanham Act and ACPA liability. The \u00a7 512(f) counterclaim fails for lack of evidence of a knowing, material copyright misrepresentation; the declaratory\u2011judgment counterclaims fail for lack of a present copyright controversy; and the equitable remedies are squarely within the district court\u2019s discretion given the findings of willfulness and bad faith. Nothing in the summary suggests reversible legal error or clearly erroneous factfinding, so a full affirmance of the district court\u2019s judgment is the most likely appellate outcome."

      "factual_background":"On March 28, 2013, a Rhode Island grand jury indicted Harlan Shabshelowitz and four co\u2011defendants on charges of obtaining money under false pretenses and conspiracy to obtain money under false pretenses, alleging a conspiracy to commit mortgage fraud. The criminal charges were brought under R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 11\u201141\u20114 and 11\u201141\u20115 (2002) for obtaining money under false pretenses and under R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 11\u20111\u20116, 11\u201141\u20114, and 11\u201141\u20115 (2002) for conspiracy.\n\nIn or around June 2015, while the criminal case was pending in the Rhode Island Superior Court, Shabshelowitz filed five separate motions to dismiss the criminal charges before a Superior Court Magistrate. In these motions he argued, among other things, that the indictment should be dismissed because of alleged misconduct during the grand jury proceedings, including prosecutorial misconduct, the presentation of misleading evidence, and missing or altered evidence.\n\nThe Magistrate held two hearings on the motions, including an evidentiary hearing on April 29, 2016, at which witness testimony was taken. In support of his motions to dismiss, Shabshelowitz submitted memoranda, grand jury transcripts, and witness testimony from three witnesses, including himself. After considering this material, the Magistrate rejected his arguments and denied the motions to dismiss in an oral order issued on June 10, 2016.\n\nShabshelowitz appealed the Magistrate's ruling to an Associate Justice of the Rhode Island Superior Court. He did not, however, appeal the Magistrate's decision rejecting his claim that evidence was missing. On December 13, 2016, the Associate Justice held a hearing on the appeal and, on de novo review, denied the appeal and adopted the Magistrate's decision in full. The Associate Justice added observations that Shabshelowitz had not presented evidence of prosecutorial misconduct that justified dismissal and had not established either a pervasive scheme to present false information to the grand jury or a sufficient amount of false factual information to justify dismissing the indictment. Shabshelowitz did not attempt to take a further appeal from the Associate Justice's ruling.\n\nOn June 5, 2017, the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office entered a nolle prosequi of the charges against Shabshelowitz pursuant to Rhode Island Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a). The dismissal occurred as part of a plea agreement that the Attorney General's Office reached with one of Shabshelowitz's co\u2011defendants.\n\nOn February 27, 2020, more than thirty\u2011two months after the nolle prosequi, Shabshelowitz filed a civil lawsuit in federal court. In that lawsuit he alleged that the State lacked probable cause to prosecute him but nonetheless induced the grand jury to indict him by withholding exculpatory evidence and misrepresenting inculpatory evidence. The factual basis of his federal malicious prosecution claim centers on the alleged lack of probable cause for the indictment and the alleged misconduct in the grand jury proceedings that led to the indictment.",

On February 9, 2021, he amended his complaint to omit all but a single state\u2011law claim for malicious prosecution. The case proceeded in federal court under diversity jurisdiction.",
        "district_court_decision":"After discovery closed on November 22, 2023 (following multiple extensions), defendants moved for summary judgment on January 16, 2024. Among other grounds, they argued that Shabshelowitz was collaterally estopped from contesting whether his indictment was procured without probable cause or through prosecutorial misconduct, because those issues had already been litigated and decided against him in the state\u2011court proceedings on his motions to dismiss. The district court determined that Rhode Island collateral estoppel applied. It found that the issues in the state criminal motions to dismiss regarding alleged prosecutorial misconduct and fraud in procuring the indictment were identical to the issues Shabshelowitz sought to relitigate in his malicious prosecution claim. The court noted that two Rhode Island state courts (the Magistrate and the Associate Justice, on de novo review) had denied his motions to dismiss, rejecting his arguments that the indictment was procured by fraud and misconduct. The district court concluded that there had been a final disposition on those issues, that the parties were the same, and that Shabshelowitz had received a full and fair opportunity to litigate the matter in state court, supported in part by the state courts' evidentiary hearing and his failure to pursue a further appeal from the Associate Justice's ruling. On that basis, the court granted summary judgment to defendants, holding that collateral estoppel barred relitigation of the prosecutorial misconduct and lack\u2011of\u2011probable\u2011cause issues central to the malicious prosecution claim.",

Under Rhode Island law, a ruling can be \u2018final\u2019 for collateral estoppel purposes even though it does not terminate the entire criminal case, so long as the specific issue was fully decided and is not subject to further reconsideration in that proceeding. Here, the Superior Court Magistrate denied the motions to dismiss after an evidentiary hearing, and an Associate Justice, on de novo review, adopted and supplemented that ruling. The issues of prosecutorial misconduct and sufficiency of the indictment were thereby conclusively resolved in that forum. Rhode Island decisions treat such determinations as final for issue-preclusion purposes, particularly where, as here, they became law of the case in the criminal matter and were never disturbed. The appellant\u2019s argument that only a judgment ending the criminal prosecution can be \u2018final\u2019 is too narrow and inconsistent with modern preclusion doctrine and Rhode Island\u2019s application of collateral estoppel. The district court\u2019s conclusion that there was a final judgment on the merits as to the issues decided on the motions to dismiss is thus likely to be upheld."

The record shows that appellant filed multiple motions to dismiss in Superior Court, submitted written memoranda and grand jury transcripts, and participated in an evidentiary hearing at which three witnesses, including himself, testified. A Magistrate ruled against him, and an Associate Justice conducted de novo review, rejected his claims of misconduct and fraud, and adopted the decision in full. He did not seek any further review. Those procedures comfortably satisfy the \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 requirement under due process and Rhode Island law. His contention that collateral estoppel should not apply because he allegedly lacked a realistic opportunity to appeal to the Rhode Island Supreme Court is weak: (1) he never attempted such an appeal; (2) collateral estoppel in Rhode Island does not hinge on the availability of a second layer of appellate review, but on whether the litigant had a meaningful chance to present his case; and (3) federal courts routinely apply issue preclusion to state trial\u2011level determinations that have not been reviewed by a state supreme court. The district court\u2019s reliance on the extensive Superior Court process and appellant\u2019s failure to pursue further review was reasonable, and the \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 prong is likely to be affirmed."

The panel therefore is likely to hold that these new objections to the \u2018final judgment\u2019 and \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 components were waived, and to decline to consider them on the merits, which independently supports affirmance of the summary judgment."

Appellant has conceded identity of issues and does not dispute that the parties are the same; his remaining challenges focus on (1) whether there was a \u2018final judgment on the merits\u2019 and (2) whether he had a full and fair opportunity to litigate, with an additional procedural hurdle that these specific theories were not presented to the district court. Under the First Circuit\u2019s raise\u2011or\u2011waive doctrine, the new attacks on the \u2018finality\u2019 and \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 components are likely deemed forfeited because appellant\u2019s opposition below was limited to the identity\u2011of\u2011issues element and he offers no extraordinary circumstances justifying deviation from that rule. Even if the court elects to look past waiver, the Rhode Island Superior Court process\u2014written submissions, an evidentiary hearing, and de novo review by an Associate Justice\u2014easily qualifies as a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues. The Associate Justice\u2019s decision, adopting and supplementing the Magistrate\u2019s ruling and left unappealed, is a sufficiently final adjudication of those discrete issues for purposes of Rhode Island issue preclusion. Because those determinations preclude relitigation of the lack\u2011of\u2011probable\u2011cause and prosecutorial\u2011misconduct allegations at the heart of the malicious prosecution claim, summary judgment for defendants was proper.

      "factual_background":"Monika Kapoor is a citizen of India who entered the United States in 1999 and overstayed her visa. In March 2010 she was placed in immigration removal proceedings. She applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).\n\nOn April 26, 2010, an Indian court issued a warrant for Kapoor\u2019s arrest on five charges under the Indian Penal Code (IPC): (1) cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property (IPC \u00a7 420); (2) forgery of valuable security, will, etc. (IPC \u00a7 467); (3) forgery for the purpose of cheating (IPC \u00a7 468); (4) using as genuine a forged document (IPC \u00a7 471); and (5) criminal conspiracy to commit the foregoing offenses (IPC \u00a7 120B). These charges arise from allegations that Kapoor and her two brothers forged documents related to jewelry transactions and used those forged documents to obtain licenses from the Indian government to import raw materials duty free, allegedly causing the Indian government a loss of approximately $679,000.\n\nIn October 2010, India made a formal request to the U.S. Department of State for Kapoor\u2019s extradition under the 1997 Treaty on Extradition between the United States and India. Under Article 2 of that treaty, an extraditable offense is one punishable in both countries by more than one year of imprisonment or a more severe penalty.\n\nOn May 2, 2011, the United States, acting on India\u2019s request, filed a complaint in the Eastern District of New York seeking an arrest warrant for Kapoor under the extradition statutes. A magistrate judge issued a warrant that same day. Kapoor was arrested, arraigned, and released on bail while extradition proceedings were pending. Her ongoing immigration removal proceedings were held in abeyance pending resolution of the extradition matter.\n\nAn extradition hearing was held on July 28, 2011 before the magistrate judge, limited to determining extraditability under the treaty and statutes. Kapoor\u2019s sole argument at the hearing was that there was no probable cause to sustain the charges. On April 17, 2012, the magistrate judge found that a valid treaty existed, that the charged offenses were extraditable under the treaty, and that the Indian government\u2019s evidence established probable cause as to each of the five charges. The magistrate judge issued a certificate of extraditability and transmitted it to the Secretary of State, while denying the government\u2019s request to revoke Kapoor\u2019s bond.\n\nAfter the judicial certification, the matter went to the Department of State for the discretionary surrender decision, including consideration of any CAT-based objections. On July 24, 2015, Kapoor submitted materials to the Secretary of State asking that extradition be denied on the ground that she would be at risk of harm if surrendered to India. On September 18, 2015, the State Department issued a surrender warrant (the \"Surrender Warrant\") authorizing her extradition to India under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3186 and the U.S.\u2013India extradition treaty. In a September 25, 2015 explanatory letter, the Department stated that it had reviewed all materials submitted by Kapoor and the pleadings and filings in the district court proceedings, and it expressly addressed the United States\u2019 obligation under CAT not to extradite a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of torture. Applying its CAT regulations (22 C.F.R. part 95) and the \"more likely than not\" standard, the Department stated that the decision to surrender Kapoor to India complied with the United States\u2019 obligations under CAT and its implementing statute and regulations.\n\nKapoor submitted additional materials to the Department relating to her CAT claim after she filed a second habeas petition (which she later withdrew when the Department agreed to consider the new materials). On August 4, 2016, the State Department informed Kapoor that it reaffirmed its earlier decision to authorize her surrender, again stating that it had reviewed the additional materials and that the extradition decision complied with the United States\u2019 CAT-related obligations.\n\nLater, developments occurred in the Indian criminal proceedings. Kapoor advised the U.S. district court in 2021 that two of the Indian charges against her (IPC \u00a7\u00a7 467 and 468) had been dismissed and that her two brothers, who were co-defendants in India, had resolved the remaining three charges by paying fines. She submitted a letter from an Indian law firm indicating that the Indian court would allow Kapoor to resolve the three remaining charges with fines. Based on this, she argued that she no longer faced any offense requiring imprisonment and therefore no longer faced an \"extraditable\" offense under the treaty.\n\nThe Indian government responded by letter dated February 7, 2022, stating that neither it nor the Indian court had offered to resolve Kapoor\u2019s remaining charges with a fine alone and characterizing Kapoor\u2019s contrary representation as \"misleading and false.\" It explained that Kapoor\u2019s co-defendants had been fined and given credit for time already served in custody, resulting in sentences of time served, but the remaining offenses against Kapoor themselves carried potential terms of imprisonment exceeding one year. The Indian government also confirmed that the extradition request remained valid notwithstanding the dismissal of two counts, as the remaining charges were still punishable by imprisonment of more than one year under Indian law.\n\nOn March 3, 2022, after receiving updated information from India, the Department of State issued an Amended Surrender Warrant limited to the remaining three charges (IPC \u00a7\u00a7 420, 471, and 120B). In a sworn declaration, the Department stated that, in connection with issuing the Amended Surrender Warrant, it reviewed all materials submitted by Kapoor to the district court and to the Department up to March 3, 2022 and concluded that nothing received after the original 2015 surrender warrant required reassessing its prior analysis of Kapoor\u2019s CAT-related claims. The declaration again stated that the Amended Surrender Warrant complied with the United States\u2019 obligations under CAT and its implementing statute and regulations.\n\nThroughout this period, Kapoor remained on bond subject to conditions. Her habeas litigation in federal court challenged the legality of her custody and continued extradition in light of the Secretary of State\u2019s decisions concerning her CAT claim and the subsequent modification of charges in India.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"In the underlying extradition proceedings, the United States, acting on behalf of India, sought certification of Kapoor\u2019s extraditability on five Indian criminal charges. Kapoor contested the extradition at the 2011 extradition hearing only on the ground that there was no probable cause supporting the charges. After the magistrate judge certified her extraditability, Kapoor brought multiple habeas corpus petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and related requests for relief:\n\n1. First habeas petition (2012): Kapoor challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s extradition certification, arguing (a) that the magistrate judge improperly excluded certain evidence she proffered at the extradition hearing, and (b) that the dual criminality requirement of the India\u2013U.S. extradition treaty was not satisfied. She sought to invalidate the magistrate judge\u2019s extraditability certification.\n\n2. Second habeas petition (2015): After the Secretary of State issued the September 2015 Surrender Warrant, Kapoor filed a habeas petition challenging the Department of State\u2019s extradition decision, focusing on her CAT claim. She submitted additional evidence in support of alleged risk of torture in India. After the Department agreed to consider the new evidence, she withdrew this petition without prejudice.\n\n3. Third habeas petition (2016, at issue on this appeal): Kapoor filed a new \u00a7 2241 petition asserting that the Secretary\u2019s extradition decision violated her procedural and substantive due process rights, CAT, and FARRA. She alleged that she would likely be tortured if returned to India and that the Secretary had erred in concluding otherwise. She sought several forms of relief: (a) that the district court assume jurisdiction over her humanitarian and torture-related claims; (b) a preliminary injunction prohibiting her extradition or surrender to Indian authorities while the matter was pending; (c) an order allowing her to give depositions in the United States to the Indian government; (d) a writ of habeas corpus ordering her release from what she characterized as \"executive detention\"; and (e) any other appropriate relief.\n\nLater, through supplemental filings, Kapoor also argued that the extradition request and the prior certification had become \"stale\" due to (i) the dismissal of two IPC charges in India, and (ii) her contention that the remaining charges were effectively resolvable by fines and therefore no longer met the treaty\u2019s requirement of punishable offenses exceeding one year of imprisonment.",
        "district_court_decision":"On her first habeas petition, the district court held that the magistrate judge had properly excluded Kapoor\u2019s proffered evidence at the extradition hearing and that the dual criminality requirement was satisfied. The court therefore denied the writ. The Second Circuit later affirmed that denial.\n\nOn the third habeas petition (the petition underlying this appeal), the district court received briefing and held oral argument on November 18, 2021. At argument, the court requested supplemental briefing on several matters, including whether it had jurisdiction to review the Secretary of State\u2019s CAT determination in the extradition context, and the impact of changed circumstances in the Indian criminal case.\n\nAfter additional submissions, including updated communications from the Indian government and notice of the Amended Surrender Warrant from the State Department, the district court issued a written decision on September 20, 2022. The court concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to review Kapoor\u2019s CAT-based challenge to the Secretary\u2019s extradition decision. It reasoned that, while earlier Second Circuit authority had allowed habeas review of CAT claims under FARRA, Congress\u2019s subsequent enactment of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(4) (as part of the REAL ID Act) limited judicial review of CAT claims to petitions for review of immigration removal orders and precluded habeas review in other contexts, such as extradition. Relying in part on D.C. Circuit precedent, the district court characterized the statute as leaving an extraditee with no statutory right to judicial review of conditions in the receiving country. The district court also concluded that this limitation did not violate the Suspension Clause because historically the writ of habeas corpus in extradition did not encompass review of anticipated conditions in the receiving country. On that basis, the district court denied Kapoor\u2019s third habeas petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.",

Bush, Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, and St. Cyr. In the extradition context, longstanding doctrine, including the \"rule of non-inquiry,\" limits habeas review to specific questions such as the extradition court\u2019s jurisdiction, the presence of a valid treaty, whether the charged offense falls within the treaty, and whether there was any evidence supporting the finding of probable cause; historically, habeas has not been used to review anticipated treatment in the receiving country."

Under Second Circuit extradition precedent, courts look to the maximum authorized penalty or the statutory range to determine extraditability, not the actual or anticipated sentence imposed in the foreign proceedings. A certificate of extraditability is treated as a non-final, non-appealable order, but may be indirectly challenged in habeas proceedings on narrow grounds, including whether the offense remains within the treaty given subsequent developments. The court must consider whether post-certification changes in foreign charges alter the treaty extraditability analysis."

She argues that access to habeas review is constitutionally required because she is challenging the legality of her continued restraint and potential transfer to a country where she alleges she faces a likelihood of torture, and that such review falls within the historic role of habeas as a check on unlawful executive detention.",
          "She contends that the rule of non-inquiry should not preclude judicial review where Congress, through CAT and FARRA, has created a substantive standard and obligations regarding torture in the receiving country. In her view, the Secretary\u2019s decision to extradite in alleged violation of those obligations necessarily presents a legal question that a habeas court must be able to review, at least to ensure that the Secretary meaningfully considered and applied the \"more likely than not\" CAT standard.",

She contends that, if the remaining offenses can and likely will be resolved through fines, they should not support extradition and the original certification is no longer valid.",

The government emphasizes that the statute explicitly references 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and \"any other habeas corpus provision\" and designates a petition for review of a removal order as the \"sole and exclusive means\" for judicial review of any cause or claim under CAT, thereby foreclosing extradition-related CAT claims in habeas proceedings.",

According to the government, the statute\u2019s broad use of the word \"any\" in describing CAT claims shows that the restriction applies regardless of whether the claim arises in the removal context, in extradition, or in other transfer settings, except where Congress has specifically preserved review.",
          "On the constitutional issue, the government argues that barring habeas review of CAT claims in extradition cases does not violate the Suspension Clause because such claims fall outside the historic core of habeas corpus. It cites the longstanding rule of non-inquiry in extradition, under which habeas review does not extend to anticipated conditions or treatment in the receiving country, including the fairness of foreign criminal procedures or risk of mistreatment. The government contends that historically, habeas in extradition has been limited to narrow questions such as jurisdiction of the committing magistrate, existence of a valid treaty, coverage of the offense under the treaty, and sufficiency of evidence to establish probable cause.",
          "The government notes that, in this statutory and doctrinal framework, the Executive Branch\u2014specifically the Secretary of State\u2014has traditionally held exclusive authority and responsibility to weigh humanitarian considerations and potential mistreatment in the requested state when deciding whether to surrender a fugitive. The government argues that CAT and FARRA did not alter this foundational division of responsibility between courts and the Executive but rather codified the Executive\u2019s role and directed the State Department to adopt internal regulations, which it did (22 C.F.R. part 95) while specifying that the Secretary\u2019s extradition decisions are matters of executive discretion not subject to judicial review.",

It maintains that the district court\u2019s inquiry into its jurisdiction, including its request for supplemental briefing and subsequent conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction, was a proper exercise of judicial process and does not itself violate due process. The government also asserts that Kapoor received all process to which she was entitled in the extradition proceedings and through the Secretary of State\u2019s consideration of her humanitarian submissions.",

It relies on the Indian government\u2019s communications that the remaining three charges (IPC \u00a7\u00a7 420, 471, and 120B) remain punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year and thus continue to meet the treaty\u2019s extraditability standard, regardless of the particular sentence the Indian court may impose on Kapoor if she is convicted. The government emphasizes that under treaty practice and Second Circuit precedent, extraditability turns on the statutory maximum penalty or range, not on whether, in practice, a defendant might receive a fine or time-served sentence.",
          "The government contends that the issuance of the Amended Surrender Warrant demonstrates that the Secretary of State updated the surrender authorization in light of changes to the Indian charges and again confirmed conformity with CAT obligations. It argues that no further judicial review is necessary or permitted, and that the Secretary\u2019s actions remain within the Executive\u2019s discretionary authority in extradition matters."

          "reasoning":"Section 1252(a)(4) is textually framed around review of CAT claims via a petition for review of a \u201cfinal order of removal.\u201d Read in context with \u00a7 1252 as a whole, it regulates judicial review in the immigration-removal setting, not extradition. Under St. Cyr and related cases, Congress must speak with an unmistakably clear statement to curtail \u00a7 2241 habeas; here, Congress clearly displaced habeas only for CAT claims arising from removal orders. Applying that same language to extradition-specific CAT claims would require extending a provision centered on removal orders far beyond its natural scope. Given (1) the absence of any reference to extradition, (2) the structure of \u00a7 1252, and (3) the constitutional-avoidance canon in light of the serious Suspension Clause concerns that a total bar on review would raise, the better reading is that \u00a7 1252(a)(4) does not strip habeas jurisdiction over extradition-related CAT\/FARRA claims. The district court therefore erred in dismissing the petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on that basis."

To the extent the court comments, it will endorse the historical limits of habeas in extradition (rule of non\u2011inquiry) and note that claims about anticipated treatment abroad were not historically part of the core of the writ. But having interpreted \u00a7 1252(a)(4) not to reach extradition CAT claims, it need not hold that applying \u00a7 1252(a)(4) in that broader fashion would be unconstitutional. Thus, the district court\u2019s specific Suspension Clause ruling (that applying \u00a7 1252(a)(4) to bar review would not violate the Clause) will either be deemed unnecessary to the disposition or implicitly rejected as dicta without a formal reversal.

          "reasoning":"Kapoor\u2019s stand\u2011alone due process theories do not supply an independent jurisdictional hook beyond her CAT\/FARRA challenge. (a) The district court\u2019s request for supplemental briefing, followed by a jurisdictional dismissal, is a routine exercise of judicial authority and not arbitrary or fundamentally unfair; a court may change its preliminary views after full briefing without violating due process. (b) Her \u201cstaleness\u201d arguments rest on developments going to the scope of extraditable offenses and the foreign prosecution, which fall within the traditional limits of extradition review and were functionally addressed by the magistrate\u2019s earlier certification and by the State Department\u2019s amended surrender decision. To the extent she claims the court failed to adjudicate those arguments, they either duplicate her treaty\/extraditability contentions (addressed elsewhere) or are folded into her CAT challenge. (c) Her attack on the Secretary\u2019s internal decisionmaking (alleged lack of a sufficiently reasoned CAT analysis) is essentially an attempt to obtain merits review of the CAT determination, not the assertion of a freestanding constitutional procedural right; there is no precedent recognizing a due process right to judicially review the quality of the Secretary\u2019s CAT analysis in extradition. Accordingly, apart from the CAT\u2011based jurisdictional question in issue 1, Kapoor has not alleged a colorable procedural or substantive due process violation that would expand habeas jurisdiction, and the district court\u2019s rejection of those due process theories is sustained."

          "prediction":"AFFIRM",
          "reasoning":"Under the U.S.\u2013India extradition treaty and settled Second Circuit precedent, extraditability turns on whether the remaining offenses are, by their statutory definition, punishable by more than one year of imprisonment\u2014not on the sentence likely to be imposed in practice. The Indian authorities confirmed that the three surviving charges (IPC \u00a7\u00a7 420, 471, 120B) each carry maximum penalties exceeding a year, and that the extradition request remains valid. The fact that Kapoor\u2019s brothers received fines and time served does not retroactively alter the statutory character of the offenses or their treaty status. Nor does the dismissal of two counts invalidate the original certification; at most it narrows the set of offenses for which surrender may be authorized, which the State Department addressed by issuing an Amended Surrender Warrant limited to the three remaining counts. There is no doctrine under which such intervening developments, without more, render the certification \u201cstale\u201d or void.

      "overall_outcome":"MIXED",
      "confidence":0.7,
      "reasoning":"The central legal issue is whether \u00a7 1252(a)(4) strips \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction over extradition\u2011related CAT\/FARRA claims. The statutory text, structure, and the St. Cyr clear\u2011statement rule favor a narrow reading: \u00a7 1252(a)(4) channels CAT challenges to petitions for review of final removal orders and does not speak to extradition. Extending the bar to extradition would require both a strained reading of the phrase \u201creview of any cause or claim under the Convention\u201d and disregard of the provision\u2019s anchoring in removal\u2011order review. Because an alternative reading that preserves some habeas review in extradition is \u201cfairly possible,\u201d avoidance of serious Suspension Clause concerns also points toward that interpretation. On that ground, the district court\u2019s jurisdictional dismissal should be reversed and the CAT\u2011based habeas claim remanded for consideration on the merits (subject to the traditional limits of extradition review and the rule of non\u2011inquiry). By contrast, Kapoor\u2019s independent due process theories and her \u201cstaleness\u201d challenge to extraditability are weak under existing extradition doctrine. Extraditability is measured by statutory maximums, not anticipated fines, and the Executive\u2019s handling of changed foreign charges via an amended surrender warrant is consistent with treaty practice. The court will therefore affirm the district court\u2019s rejection of those arguments. The net result is a mixed disposition: reversal of the jurisdictional ruling as to CAT\/FARRA claims, with remand for further proceedings, but affirmance on the remaining due process and staleness\/extraditability issues."

Woodruff, Deputy Superintendent of Programs Joanne Fitchette, Offender Rehabilitator Coordinator Melissa A. Cook, James A. O\u2019Gorman, and other officials of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), defendants in their official or individual capacities alleged to have been responsible for Walker\u2019s administrative segregation reviews."
      },
      "factual_background":"Tyrone Walker entered New York State prison custody in 1994 and has spent most of his incarceration in maximum-security conditions and, from 2000 onward, largely in solitary confinement. His convictions stem from a series of violent crimes committed in 1993. On February 18, 1993, in Cragsmoor, New York, Walker murdered a rival drug dealer, Michael Monsour, during an attempt to rob Monsour of cocaine and drug proceeds. On February 23, 1993, Walker committed two additional armed robbery attempts: he shot at a woman, Bonnie Bear, in Manhattan during an attempted robbery, causing injuries that led to her death eight days later, and he shot at a man, Herbert Muskin, in Brooklyn during another attempted robbery, though Muskin was not physically injured. For the February 23 incidents, a New York state court sentenced Walker to an aggregate term of 32\u00bd years to life in prison for robbery, murder, and weapons offenses. For the February 18 murder of Monsour, Walker was prosecuted federally in the Northern District of New York; the government sought the death penalty. The jury did not unanimously agree to impose death, and Walker received a federal sentence of life imprisonment without parole.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, including while his prosecutions were pending, Walker engaged in additional violent conduct. In 1992 he participated in the beating and stabbing of another incarcerated person at the Sullivan County jail, during which the victim was stabbed approximately 18 times. In 1995, while awaiting his federal trial, he allegedly attempted to escape from custody, smuggled a razor blade into court, attempted to hire a hitman to kill a government witness, assaulted a deputy in an effort to steal keys, and engaged in other violent or escape-related acts. Some of these allegations were documented in communications from federal prosecutors to prison authorities and during the penalty phase of his federal trial; not all resulted in separate prosecutions or unanimous factual findings by the jury.\n\nOnce in DOCCS custody, Walker was initially housed in the general population of maximum-security facilities, including Downstate and Green Haven Correctional Facilities. Between 1994 and mid-2000, he incurred a series of disciplinary infractions. He received approximately twelve Tier II misbehavior reports for relatively less serious rule violations such as being out of place, refusing direct orders, unauthorized phone use, smuggling, creating disturbances, possessing contraband, and an incident involving threats and delay of count. He also received one Tier III misbehavior report in 1996 for possession of a weapon and an altered item.\n\nOn September 27, 2000, Walker committed an extremely violent assault in the recreation yard at Green Haven. He obtained an ice pick and a knife, secured them to his hands with leather thongs, and attacked the Deputy Superintendent of Security (DSS), stabbing him multiple times and causing serious injuries including multiple stab wounds and fractures to the head and shoulder areas. During the incident, Walker stabbed a second officer and punched a third officer while being escorted to segregation. He was prosecuted in state court for attempted murder, pled guilty, and received an additional sentence of 15 years to life, increasing his state minimum to 47\u00bd years. Administratively, DOCCS imposed an approximately 14\u2011year term of Disciplinary Segregation, which he served under solitary confinement conditions in Special Housing Units (SHUs) at various facilities from about late 2000 until 2014.\n\nDuring his years in Disciplinary Segregation, Walker incurred further misbehavior reports, particularly in the early years. From 2000 to 2014 he received four Tier II and seven Tier III misbehavior reports, including infractions for harassment, creating disturbances and interference, threats, altered items and unauthorized exchanges, smuggling, demonstration, refusing direct orders, bribery\/extortion, drug use, possession of an alleged weapon, and property-related violations. One incident in 2011 involved a small piece of plexiglass that DOCCS classified as a weapon; Walker contended it was only a mirror used to look out of his cell. None of the documented infractions during this period involved new acts of physical violence against persons. Over time, Walker\u2019s behavior improved. He stated that he learned to address grievances through formal grievance and litigation procedures. His later record in Disciplinary Segregation led to reductions (\u201ctime cuts\u201d) in his SHU sentence. From March 2012 until his punitive SHU term ended in January 2014, he incurred no misbehavior reports.\n\nAs Walker\u2019s Disciplinary Segregation term approached its end in January 2014, DOCCS staff reviewed his history to determine his housing status. Administrative Segregation (Ad Seg) in New York is a non-punitive, indeterminate status for people whom officials believe would pose a threat to facility safety and security if housed in the general population. Individuals in Ad Seg are ordinarily housed in SHU under the same restrictive solitary conditions as those serving disciplinary sentences. The regulatory standard for Ad Seg at the time required a determination that the inmate\u2019s presence in the general population would pose a threat to safety and security. DOCCS procedures required an initial Ad Seg recommendation based on identified security concerns, a hearing with written disposition, and, thereafter, periodic multi-tier reviews.\n\nOn the day before Walker\u2019s Disciplinary Segregation sentence was to end, a DOCCS employee recommended that he be placed in Ad Seg rather than returned to general population. The recommendation cited his 1993 murder and robbery offenses, his earlier alleged escape-related conduct and violent incidents while awaiting trial, the 2000 assault on the DSS and other staff, his disciplinary record in prison, and statements from a 2010 intercepted letter in which he had described himself as extremely capable at fighting and \"one of the most dangerous prisoners in the state\" and referenced disciplining his partner\u2019s teenage sons. After an Ad Seg hearing in early 2014, DOCCS formally designated Walker for Ad Seg. Walker did not challenge that initial 2014 designation in this lawsuit.\n\nThe day after his Ad Seg designation was affirmed, while still in SHU, Walker handed a small crescent-shaped piece of metal to an officer, saying he had found it while cleaning his cell and joking that there should be a reward for his good behavior. The officer perceived the item as a sharpened weapon and issued a Tier III misbehavior report charging bribery\/extortion, weapon possession, altered item, and property in an unauthorized area.\n\nAfter his Ad Seg designation, Walker was transferred to the SHU at Upstate Correctional Facility, a prison where approximately 80 percent of the housing consists of SHU cells. From 2014 through at least July 2019 (when the district court summary judgment record closed), Walker remained in Ad Seg housing at Upstate. DOCCS later advised that he remained in SHU until March 2022, after which he was transferred to a step-down unit under new state legislation limiting segregated confinement.\n\nConditions in SHU during the relevant period were highly restrictive. Incarcerated individuals in SHU generally spent nearly all of their time alone in small concrete cells with solid doors and food hatches, with one hour of solitary exercise in a small enclosed \u201crec cage\u201d per day. They had significantly limited access to personal property, reading materials, packages, telephone calls, showers, and visits compared to general population. They could not physically access the law library and were limited to borrowing small amounts of legal material at a time. Non-legal visits and phone calls were strictly capped, and they had access to only a few showers per week. Some limited incentives, such as additional showers, minor commissary privileges, or clothing items, could be earned through positive behavior. Over the relevant period, state authorities and courts noted that prolonged SHU confinement was associated with serious mental and physical harms, and DOCCS regulations and state statutes were gradually revised to shorten or restrict the use of segregated confinement.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2019, while in Ad Seg at Upstate, Walker\u2019s disciplinary record was largely clean. He incurred only one misbehavior report, in June 2017, when he refused to end a telephone call with his daughter at the direction of Offender Rehabilitator Coordinator (ORC) and Defendant Melissa Cook and cursed at her. The Central Office Committee later noted that he anticipated and valued these calls, that he had been reassigned to a different staff member without further problems, and that aside from that incident his behavior was appropriate. Other than that event and the 2014 metal-object incident, there were no disciplinary reports for violent conduct after 2000 and no misbehavior reports at all between 2012 and 2014.\n\nDuring his years in Ad Seg, facility and central office documentation repeatedly described Walker\u2019s behavior in SHU as appropriate, polite, cooperative, quiet, and non-problematic, and noted that he caused no issues with staff. He earned the maximum incentives available in Upstate\u2019s SHU incentive programs, first under a Pilot Incentive Program and then under the Uniform Progressive Inmate Movement System (PIMS), retaining Level III status for an extended period. He also participated in programming, including completing an aggression-replacement training (anger-management type) course and engaging in academic self-study even though he already had a high school diploma. The record is unclear why he did not advance to PIMS Level IV, despite the apparent eligibility periods noted in DOCCS program charts.\n\nWalker\u2019s Ad Seg status was subject to periodic review under DOCCS regulations then in effect. During the 2014\u20132019 period, he received 46 periodic Ad Seg reviews. Each review involved up to three levels: (1) a Facility Committee at Upstate that reviewed his institutional file and met with him; (2) a Central Office Committee in Albany that reviewed the Facility Committee report and any written statement from Walker; and (3) a final decision by the Deputy Commissioner for Correctional Facilities (first Defendant Bellnier, later Defendant O\u2019Gorman).\n\nAt Upstate, the facility-level practice was that an ORC would meet with Walker and other staff, prepare the Facility Committee report, and then the other Facility Committee members would review and comment. Defendants Uhler (Superintendent), Woodruff (Deputy Superintendent of Security), Fitchette (Deputy Superintendent of Programs), and Cook (ORC) all served on the Facility Committee at various times. According to Walker\u2019s deposition testimony, in an early meeting at Upstate, Woodruff and Cook told him that they would never recommend his release from Ad Seg. Walker asserts that this reflected a pre-determined commitment to keep him in solitary; Defendants denied making such statements.\n\nThe Facility Committee reports followed a standard three-part format: (1) reasons for initial Ad Seg designation; (2) information on subsequent behavior and attitude; and (3) other factors that may favor retaining or releasing the inmate from Ad Seg. Over five years, the first part consistently repeated a description of Walker\u2019s 2000 assault on the DSS and related violence. The second part typically noted his current behavior, almost always describing it as appropriate or appropriate with staff, sometimes adding that he was polite, cooperative, quiet, and caused no problems. Many reports repeated his historical disciplinary infractions in the \"subsequent behavior\" section, even when those infractions predated his Ad Seg status. The third part of the reports\u2014where other factors supporting retention or release were supposed to be discussed\u2014contained a nearly identical set of sentences in each review, emphasizing that Walker had demonstrated a propensity for assaultive and dangerous behavior in his criminal history and in prison, and that his ability and willingness to inflict extreme violence on staff and inmates made his presence in general population an extreme risk to facility safety and security. Until mid-2017, this section did not mention his positive conduct in Ad Seg as a factor, either for or against continued segregation. Beginning in August 2017, the Facility Committee added a paragraph detailing Walker\u2019s broader violent past, including his federal and state convictions and alleged violent behavior while awaiting federal trial, but still concluded that his prior conduct justified continued Ad Seg.\n\nThe Central Office Committee conducted a second review following each Facility Committee report. Walker frequently submitted written statements to this committee. In these submissions, he consistently argued that he had changed, that he had gone many years without any violent incidents, that his record in recent years showed he could live safely in general population, and that he had learned to use legal channels rather than violence. He expressed remorse, described his efforts at self-improvement, and repeatedly asked what he needed to do to earn release from Ad Seg. Many of his letters specifically requested guidance on programs or steps that could demonstrate he no longer posed a security threat. He also raised concerns about delayed reviews, medical issues, and difficulties obtaining legal materials or copies of his Ad Seg review reports.\n\nThe Central Office Committee varied in how often it responded in detail to Walker\u2019s letters. On some occasions it addressed his points; on others it largely ignored them or discussed only selected issues, such as medical complaints. It generally agreed with the Facility Committee\u2019s recommendation that Walker remain in Ad Seg, citing his history of serious violence, weapon possession, escape-related conduct, and unpredictability. Committee reports frequently noted that his behavior in Ad Seg was appropriate and that he had no new disciplinary infractions other than the 2017 phone-call incident. In several reviews, the committee characterized his written submissions as demonstrating a sense of entitlement, inadequate humility, anger, or a tendency to blame others. At times it deemed his requests\u2014such as seeking past review reports, legal resources, better ventilation, programming, or certain privileges\u2014expressions of entitlement, even though facility staff considered many of those requests routine.\n\nIn December 2018, for the first time, the Central Office Committee proposed specific steps that might support a transition to less restrictive housing. It noted that Walker would \"always remain a risk for violence\" because of his history, but stated that he must develop insight into his behavior and recommended enrollment in two programs: Aggression Replacement Training (ART) and a substance abuse program (ASAT), suggesting these could better prepare him for eventual movement to a less restrictive environment. Walker responded appreciatively and asked to be put on the waiting list. The record shows he completed the ART program and attempted to access ASAT but could not complete ASAT because there was no SHU-compatible workbook format; a later review acknowledged that ASAT did not exist in workbook form.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner for Correctional Facilities (Bellnier, then O\u2019Gorman) provided the third, final level of review. On each available review form, the Deputy Commissioner checked a box indicating that Walker\u2019s Ad Seg status would continue. On some forms, the line designated for stating reasons was left blank; on others, generic statements such as \"Your release from Admin. Segregation would pose a threat to the safety and security of the Institution\" or \"Inmate Walker\u2019s placement is appropriate at this time\" were written. Defendants acknowledged that staff sometimes pre-filled these reason lines before the Deputy Commissioner signed. The Deputy Commissioners later filed declarations explaining that they had considered Walker\u2019s entire record, including his improved conduct, but ultimately believed his past violence and risk profile required continued Ad Seg.\n\nThe timing and documentation of Walker\u2019s reviews exhibited delays and irregularities. Regulations required periodic review (initially every 60 days, later every 30 days) and provision of written notice and reasons to the inmate, along with a statement that he could respond in writing before the next review period. In practice, some reviews were completed by the Deputy Commissioner after the next review period had already begun or even after a subsequent review had been completed. For example, certain 2016\u20132017 reviews were signed months late, and in at least two instances the Deputy Commissioner completed a review for an earlier period after already approving continued Ad Seg for a later period. Additionally, Walker often received copies of his completed reviews months after the relevant period, sometimes in large batches. At one point he received nine separate reviews at once in January 2019, covering a series of prior review cycles.\n\nThese delays affected his ability to respond to specific rationales being used to continue his Ad Seg. In one example, the Central Office Committee characterized an incident involving a forgotten visitor package as showing that Walker became enraged and suggested he might assault security staff. Because he did not timely receive that review, he could not correct the account until long after the fact. When he did respond, he stated that he had thanked Woodruff for helping hold the package and that he had not threatened anyone. Later documentation appears to reflect that the Committee accepted this clarification and stopped relying on that particular description. In another example, the Committee began describing Walker\u2019s 2014 possession of the small metal object as a deliberate attempt to manipulate his transfer by obtaining a weapon so as to incur a misbehavior report that would cancel his transfer. Walker later explained in writing that he did not know about transfers in advance, had sought transfer away from Clinton, and had contested the misbehavior report; after repeated written objections, the Committee stopped using that specific \"manipulation\" narrative, although it continued to note the incident as evidence of weapon-related behavior.\n\nThroughout 2014\u20132019, Walker remained continuously in Ad Seg SHU at Upstate. When the record closed in 2019, he had been in solitary confinement for nearly 20 years (initially punitive Disciplinary Segregation, then preventive Ad Seg) and in prison for about 25 years. He had not been involved in any violent incident since the 2000 assault, and his only misbehavior during the five years at Upstate was the 2017 non-violent phone-call incident. Defendants continued to consider him a very high security risk based largely on his prior violent and escape-related conduct and his perceived propensity and capacity for sudden extreme violence. Walker acknowledged the seriousness of his earlier offenses but contended that his long record of relatively good behavior, aging, and participation in programs showed that he no longer posed the same risk and that, at a minimum, he was entitled to a periodic review process that genuinely evaluated whether continued solitary confinement was still necessary for institutional safety.",
      "procedural_history":{

His operative second amended complaint, accepted by the district court in 2019 after screening and motion practice, focused on claims related to the allegedly inadequate process surrounding his continued placement in Ad Seg from 2014 to 2019.

The magistrate judge concluded that the periodic Ad Seg reviews Walker received satisfied the requirements set forth in Proctor v. LeClaire and were constitutionally meaningful; accordingly, the magistrate judge rejected Walker\u2019s procedural due process claim at the merits stage and did not reach the qualified immunity argument. The district court (Chief Judge Suddaby) considered Walker\u2019s objections, adopted the report and recommendation in full in March 2021, and granted summary judgment to the defendants. In the alternative, the district court ruled that even if there were any deficiency in the review process, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established right of Walker\u2019s had been violated under the circumstances.",

Helms and Proctor v. LeClaire, and (2) whether the defendant officials are entitled to qualified immunity.

          "Walker contends that, although DOCCS conducted 46 nominal reviews of his Administrative Segregation status between 2014 and 2019, the process was not constitutionally meaningful. He argues that the Facility Committee reports were largely boilerplate, repeating the same language about his 2000 assault and past violent conduct in every review, and that the \"other factors\" section never seriously engaged with or credited his sustained record of appropriate, non-violent behavior over many years in SHU.",
          "He asserts that prison officials effectively predetermined that he would remain in Ad Seg indefinitely, pointing to his testimony that Defendants Woodruff and Cook told him at the outset that they would never recommend his release from Ad Seg, and to Central Office Committee statements suggesting that he would \"always\" be a risk and that his clean record was attributable solely to restrictive conditions, rather than genuine change.",
          "He argues that the reviews improperly relied almost exclusively on long-past misconduct\u2014his 1993 homicides, 1990s jail violence and escape-related acts, and the 2000 assault\u2014without assessing whether he still posed a current security risk in light of his aging, his absence of violent incidents for nearly two decades, and his compliance with rules and completion of programs in recent years. He maintains that this reliance on remote events shows that Ad Seg was being used to punish him for past wrongs rather than to address present and future institutional safety.",
          "Walker contends that the Central Office Committee used circular reasoning to discount his good behavior, by treating the absence of violent incidents in SHU as evidence only of the security provided by SHU itself and not as evidence of reduced risk, and by treating his attempts to participate in the process and request programming, legal resources, and medical care as indications of \"entitlement\" rather than as positive or neutral behavior.",
          "He maintains that the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s role in the review process was a \"rubber stamp\" rather than an independent review. He relies on the fact that the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s section of many forms either lacked any explanation or contained only generic conclusions apparently pre-written by subordinates, and that there was no documented instance where the Deputy Commissioner disagreed with or significantly modified the committees\u2019 recommendations.",
          "Walker further argues that chronic delays in completing and delivering review reports to him undermined the meaningfulness of the process. He points to multiple review cycles where the Deputy Commissioner signed reviews months late, sometimes after subsequent cycles were already decided, and to instances where he received long-delayed batches of prior reviews all at once. He contends these delays deprived him of timely notice of the factual bases for continued Ad Seg and of a real opportunity to rebut inaccuracies or adjust his behavior in response, as illustrated by his belated ability to correct the Central Office Committee\u2019s account of the visitor\u2019s package and its characterization of the 2014 metal-object incident.",
          "He emphasizes that he repeatedly and explicitly asked DOCCS officials what he needed to do to earn release from Ad Seg and that, for several years, he received no concrete guidance. He argues that when the Central Office Committee finally suggested programs in late 2018, one of the recommended programs (ASAT) was not actually available in a form he could access in SHU, thereby reinforcing his contention that the process never seriously contemplated his eventual return to general population.",
          "On qualified immunity, Walker argues that by the time of the challenged conduct it was clearly established, through Hewitt and Proctor and related decisions, that Ad Seg could not be used as an indefinite pretext for punishment and that periodic reviews must be meaningful, consider current circumstances and new evidence, and not be mere formalities. He asserts that the evidence, viewed in his favor, shows violations of these clearly established procedural requirements, precluding summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds."

        "appellee_arguments":[
          "The DOCCS defendants argue that Walker received extensive process far exceeding constitutional minima: 46 separate reviews over five years, each involving a three-step mechanism\u2014Facility Committee review with an in-person interview, Central Office Committee review that considered his file and written submissions, and final determination by the Deputy Commissioner. They contend that this structure satisfied the requirement for periodic and meaningful review.",
          "They maintain that the reviews did consider Walker\u2019s current behavior and up-to-date circumstances, not only his past. The Facility Committee reports documented his disciplinary record for each period and acknowledged his generally appropriate behavior and lack of recent violent infractions. The Central Office Committee reports noted positive developments such as long stretches free of misbehavior and program participation. Defendants argue that the committees simply concluded that his dangerousness based on his extreme history of murders, attempted murders, escape attempts, and the 2000 prison-yard stabbings outweighed evidence of improved conduct in a highly controlled environment.",
          "Defendants contend that under governing law prison officials are entitled to accord significant, even decisive, weight to past violent conduct when assessing risk to institutional safety and are not required to release an inmate to general population merely because he has behaved appropriately in Ad Seg. They argue that Walker\u2019s history\u2014including multiple homicides, violence in custody, efforts to escape, use and possession of weapons, and an exceptionally brutal attack on staff\u2014reasonably supported a continued assessment that he posed an extreme risk if returned to a less restrictive setting.",
          "They dispute that the process was predetermined or a sham. They argue that no competent evidence shows that policy or practice barred release from Ad Seg or that the outcome in Walker\u2019s case was fixed regardless of his conduct. They emphasize that some officials in Proctor made sweeping admissions about never releasing inmates, whereas in Walker\u2019s case there is no comparable testimony. They characterize Walker\u2019s account of comments by Woodruff and Cook as disputed and insufficient, standing alone, to show system-wide or case-specific bad faith.",
          "Regarding the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s role, defendants acknowledge that staff sometimes drafted standard language for the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s reasons but assert that this is an administrative convenience and does not mean the Deputy Commissioner failed to review the case. They point to declarations in which Bellnier and O\u2019Gorman explain that they considered Walker\u2019s complete record\u2014including his improved behavior\u2014but remained convinced that his demonstrated capacity for severe and unpredictable violence warranted continued Ad Seg for safety and security. They argue that due process does not require detailed written reasoning at the final stage so long as the overall process considers relevant factors.",
          "On the alleged \"circular\" reasoning about good behavior in SHU, defendants argue that it is rational to view an inmate\u2019s clean record in an extremely restrictive environment as less probative of his risk level in a less controlled setting, and that officials are entitled to make such predictive judgments. They emphasize that due process allows prison officials to rely on subjective evaluations and risk predictions and that courts should not reweigh the evidence or second-guess their assessment of how much weight to give past versus recent conduct.",
          "With respect to delays in completing and delivering reviews, defendants concede there were administrative delays but argue these do not show that the reviews were meaningless or unconstitutional. They note there is no evidence that delays were intentional or that they prevented Walker from participating in interviews, submitting written statements, or being reviewed at regular intervals for purposes of determining his placement. They argue that not every departure from state regulatory time frames constitutes a federal due process violation and that Walker cannot show that timing irregularities changed the substance of the decisions or deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to be heard.",
          "On qualified immunity, defendants contend that, even assuming some arguable procedural imperfections, it was not clearly established that the specific combination of factors in Walker\u2019s case\u2014reliance on serious past violence, discounting of non-violent behavior in SHU as less probative, use of standardized language in reports, and administrative delays\u2014violated due process. They assert that reasonable officials in their position, guided by Hewitt and Proctor, could believe that conducting frequent, multi-layered reviews that considered both Walker\u2019s history and his current behavior satisfied constitutional requirements. Therefore, they argue, they are entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law."

          "reasoning":"On summary judgment, the court must view the record in Walker\u2019s favor. Hewitt and Proctor require that preventive segregation be supported by periodic, genuinely evaluative reviews that consider current risk, not simply serve as a vehicle for indefinite punishment for past conduct. The record, taken favorably to Walker, shows (1) nearly uniform, boilerplate Facility Committee narratives repeating his 2000 assault and older history over 46 reviews, with the \u2018other factors\u2019 section barely changing for years; (2) documentation that for a five\u2011year span he had no violent infractions and only one minor disciplinary ticket, while being consistently described as polite, quiet, and cooperative and achieving the highest incentive levels; (3) his repeated, specific written requests for guidance on what he needed to do to get out of Ad Seg, largely unanswered until late 2018, when he was finally directed to programs, one of which (ASAT) could not be completed in SHU; (4) substantial evidence of delays and back\u2011dated reviews, including Deputy Commissioner sign\u2011offs after later review periods and Walker receiving batches of many reviews at once, undermining his ability to rebut factual assertions in real time; (5) his testimony\u2014disputed but cognizable at summary judgment\u2014that key Facility Committee members told him they would never recommend his release; and (6) Deputy Commissioner forms that uniformly continued Ad Seg with either no reasons or generic language sometimes pre\u2011filled by staff, with no recorded instance of disagreement with subordinate recommendations. A reasonable jury could find that the reviews, while frequent on paper, were rote, substantially predetermined, relied almost exclusively on remote events, and did not function as a meaningful, contemporaneous assessment of current risk as Proctor requires. Because these are classic fact\u2011intensive questions about the sincerity and substance of the review process, there is at least a genuine dispute of material fact. The district court therefore erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the merits of the procedural due process claim."

          "standard_of_review":"de novo",
          "prediction":"REVERSE",
          "reasoning":"Qualified immunity at summary judgment is inappropriate where material facts bearing on whether clearly established law was violated are in dispute. By the time of the challenged conduct, Hewitt and especially Proctor (a Second Circuit case closely on point) had clearly established that: (a) inmates in long\u2011term administrative segregation are entitled to periodic reviews that are actually meaningful; (b) such reviews must genuinely consider whether continued segregation is justified by current and future security needs, not simply recycle historical misconduct; and (c) purely perfunctory or sham reviews, or decisions that treat Ad Seg as a permanent punishment for past acts, violate due process. Viewing the record in Walker\u2019s favor, a jury could find that officials (i) treated past violence as dispositive without real engagement with his subsequent two decades of non\u2011violent behavior; (ii) effectively predetermined the outcome, as suggested by Walker\u2019s account of Woodruff\u2019s and Cook\u2019s statements and by the unbroken string of boilerplate Facility and Central Office conclusions; (iii) used circular reasoning to discredit good behavior in SHU while offering no realistic path out despite his specific requests; and (iv) allowed significant delays and back\u2011dating that deprived him of timely notice and opportunity to rebut rationales. If a jury credited that version of events, it could conclude that defendants violated clearly established law as articulated in Hewitt and Proctor. Because that conclusion turns on disputed facts about how the reviews were actually conducted and what weight was truly given to current versus past conduct, the officials are not entitled to qualified immunity on summary judgment. The district court\u2019s alternative qualified\u2011immunity ruling should therefore be reversed."

      "overall_outcome":"REVERSE",
      "confidence":0.72,
      "reasoning":"This case sits squarely in the shadow of Proctor v. LeClaire, which is binding and factually analogous: an inmate held for very long periods in New York administrative segregation, extensive but allegedly rote and predetermined reviews, boilerplate rationales that rest almost entirely on remote past violence, and evidence that officials viewed Ad Seg as essentially permanent. Proctor held that such claims present triable questions of fact about whether reviews are \u2018meaningful\u2019 within the meaning of Hewitt and the Due Process Clause and therefore cannot be resolved in prison officials\u2019 favor on summary judgment. \n\nHere, the record\u2014taken favorably to Walker\u2014contains several Proctor\u2011type indicators of potentially sham or perfunctory review: (1) the near\u2011identity of rationales over many years despite a dramatic change in his recent disciplinary record; (2) long\u2011term, well\u2011documented compliance and positive behavior in SHU with almost no infractions, yet no movement toward less restrictive conditions; (3) evidence that Walker persistently sought guidance and programming to secure release but was only belatedly offered one viable program and one unavailable one; (4) substantial timing irregularities and delayed delivery of review decisions, sometimes in large batches; and (5) the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s consistent, minimally reasoned rubber\u2011stamping of committee recommendations. While the defendants present plausible explanations and emphasize their discretion to give great weight to past violence, that goes to the weight of the evidence, not to the existence of disputes. Under de novo review, these disputes preclude summary judgment. \n\nGiven Proctor\u2019s clear statement of the governing principles, and the fact that qualified immunity cannot be granted where those principles are clearly established and the central question is factual\u2014whether the reviews were genuinely evaluative or merely nominal\u2014the better prediction is that the appellate court reverses the grant of summary judgment on both the merits and qualified\u2011immunity grounds and remands for further proceedings (likely trial or additional fact development) rather than reinstating judgment for defendants."
