The disclaimer is clear, specific, and consistently maintained throughout the litigation. The State is not seeking recovery for any contamination caused by AFFF, including MilSpec AFFF produced under federal direction. If any damages are found to be caused by AFFF, they are excluded from recovery. Thus, 3M's federal acts are not at issue in this case, and any defense based on federal contractor immunity is irrelevant. The lower court correctly distinguished Nessel and similar cases, as this is not a situation where the source of contamination (AFFF vs. non-AFFF) is legally significant to liability. The First Circuit's broad construction of \u00a7 1442(a)(1) does not override the requirement of a factual nexus, which is absent here. The strongest counterargument is that factual commingling may require factfinding about AFFF, but the State's disclaimer means that any such contamination is not compensable, so the 'nexus' is illusory.",

The initial pleadings, the parallel AFFF suit, and the December 2021 disclosures all provided sufficient information for 3M to ascertain its removability argument (i.e., that the disclaimer is ineffective and commingling creates a nexus). The First Circuit's 'reasonable intelligence' standard (Romulus) requires 3M to recognize this. The lower court's finding that the 30-day clock was triggered well before removal is correct. The strongest counterargument is that the State's March 2022 statement clarified the case was not site-specific, but this was merely a reiteration of the State's consistent position."

Reasonable officials would not have had clear notice that releasing the report, even for improper motives, would violate substantive due process, especially given the overlap with state tort law and the general rule that such claims sound in procedural due process or state law, not substantive due process.

However, even if S\u00e1nchez Valle applies, the Double Jeopardy Clause only bars successive prosecutions for the 'same offense.' The record indicates that the federal and Commonwealth prosecutions were for the same conduct (possession\/carrying of a firearm). Under S\u00e1nchez Valle, Puerto Rico and the United States are the same sovereign for Double Jeopardy purposes. Therefore, the federal prosecution after a Commonwealth conviction for the same conduct would violate Double Jeopardy, unless the offenses are not the 'same' under Blockburger v.

The First Circuit in Taylor and Whindleton has held that a weapon element imports the 'violent force' required by Johnson. The statute appears to require either the use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon, which is sufficient under the force clause. The strongest counterargument is that 'intimidation' could be satisfied without actual or threatened force, but the statutory text and First Circuit precedent support the district court's conclusion.

The Supreme Court in TransUnion and Spokeo emphasized that the 'kind, not degree' of harm is key. The Tenth and Sixth Circuits (Lupia, Ward) have found that even a single unwanted communication can be a concrete injury. The district court's reliance on Pucillo (Seventh Circuit) is not binding in the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit has previously found standing in FDCPA cases involving privacy invasions, even if the harm is intangible. The strongest argument for standing is that \u00a7 1692c(a)(2) protects a substantive privacy interest, and violation of that right\u2014even by a single letter\u2014constitutes a concrete injury.
