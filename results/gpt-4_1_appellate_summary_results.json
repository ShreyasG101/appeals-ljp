      "factual_background":"On January 5, 2021, Newton Police Department (NPD) responded to a report of an ongoing armed robbery at a candy store in Newton, Massachusetts. Officer Zachary Raymond arrived and saw Michael Conlon, a 28-year-old man with a mental illness that made him fear police, standing outside the store holding a small kitchen knife. Raymond drew his weapon and ordered Conlon to drop the knife. Conlon fled into his nearby apartment building, ascended to the third floor, and threatened to cut his own throat if Raymond advanced. Raymond retreated and waited for backup. Conlon knocked on a neighbor's door, asking to speak with someone who was not home. Additional NPD and Massachusetts State Police (MSP) officers arrived, including Captains Dennis Dowling and Christopher Marzilli, who recognized Conlon was experiencing a mental-health crisis. An NPD social worker was called to the scene. Officers assembled in the hallway and in Apartment 4, which was used as a staging area. The rear door to Apartment 3 was barricaded. Officer Francis Scaltreto negotiated with Conlon, who was holding the knife and a fire extinguisher, and eventually convinced him to drop both items after about twenty minutes. Officers had assured Conlon he would not be harmed. After Conlon dropped the items, Captain Dowling instructed Sergeant Glenn Chisholm to use a beanbag shotgun to incapacitate Conlon. Chisholm attempted to fire the beanbag shotgun from about twelve feet away, but it misfired. Some officers reported that Conlon then picked up the knife and moved toward Chisholm. An MSP trooper deployed a taser, and Officers Benes and Scaltreto fired their sidearms, fatally shooting Conlon. The Northeastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council's tactical team arrived six minutes later. An autopsy showed Conlon suffered fatal gunshot wounds to the head, neck, and torso.",

The complaint alleges that Conlon had dropped his weapons after assurances he would not be harmed, and that officers then used a beanbag shotgun and, after a misfire, lethal force. These facts plausibly allege that the force used was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, especially given Conlon's mental health crisis and the officers' knowledge of it. The question of qualified immunity is fact-intensive and, at the pleading stage, dismissal is generally inappropriate unless the unlawfulness of the conduct was not clearly established. Here, the complaint plausibly alleges a violation of clearly established law regarding use of deadly force against an unarmed, non-threatening individual. Thus, the district court erred in dismissing the excessive force claim and granting qualified immunity at this stage."

The poultry products at issue are shipped by sea in large cargo containers and enter Puerto Rico via the Port of San Juan. All poultry products imported by NWS from the mainland United States are inspected by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) prior to transport and are marked as officially inspected. Upon arrival in Puerto Rico, the containers are offloaded at the port and await clearance from authorities, including the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture (PRDA). NWS provides the PRDA with bills of lading for the shipments, which indicate the contents but not their condition upon arrival. Once cleared, a contractor transports the containers to NWS's facility, where they are opened and unloaded. In June 2016, the PRDA promulgated Market Regulation No. 8, which governs the quality and marketing of poultry meat in Puerto Rico. Article XII(B) of this regulation requires a PRDA inspector to be present when a shipping container transporting poultry meat is opened and unloaded. For about five years after the regulation was enacted, the PRDA did not enforce Article XII(B) against NWS. In June 2021, the PRDA began issuing detention orders against NWS for opening and unloading containers without a PRDA inspector present, impounding over 200,000 pounds of poultry and issuing violation notices for thirty-five containers, with potential fines totaling approximately $263,000.",

The PPIA's preemption clause (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 467e) prohibits states from imposing requirements with respect to the 'premises, facilities, and operations' of any official establishment that are in addition to or different from federal requirements. The ordinary meaning of 'operations' is broad and, as the appellee argues, includes the activities of opening and unloading containers at the facility, especially since these are integral to the distribution and handling of poultry products. The PRDA's requirement that a local inspector be present during unloading imposes an additional operational requirement not found in the PPIA or its regulations. The savings clause does not apply because the regulation targets activities inside the official establishment, not outside. Federal courts and the USDA have interpreted the PPIA's preemption clause broadly to cover a wide range of activities at official establishments, including those related to receiving and handling product. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that Article XII(B) is expressly preempted."

The savings clause does not save Article XII(B) because it does not regulate activities outside the official establishment. The appellate court is likely to affirm the district court's ruling."

In January 2016, Feng Zhang became an executive at Dahua, serving as Chief Strategy Officer, Vice President, and President of North American and Enterprise Sales. Zhang's employment terms were set in a 2015 Employment Agreement, which included a one-time stock grant and an annual base salary of $510,000 for three years, with the salary 'conditionally guaranteed' even if terminated for cause (except for illegal conduct or company misconduct). In mid-2017, Zhejiang's board decided to remove Zhang from management, concerned about potential liability for early termination and the lack of restrictive covenants preventing Zhang from disclosing sensitive company information. Negotiations between Zhang and Zhejiang's chairman, Liquan Fu, led to discussions about Zhang stepping down and taking a new role. Initial drafts of separation and consulting agreements were rejected by Zhang as not reflecting the discussions. Subsequently, two new agreements were prepared: a Release Agreement (including a severance provision and restrictive covenants) and a 2017 Employment Agreement (offering Zhang a Senior Corporate Advisor role at $240,000 per year). The Release Agreement stated that Dahua would make 'monthly severance payments to you in the amount of $680,000 for sixteen (16) months.' Both agreements were signed by Zhang and Fu. After Zhang began his new role, Dahua paid him according to his previous salary and the new advisor salary.

As part of the merger process, Shanda issued two proxy statements (the 'Proxies') to shareholders, representing the merger as fair and relying on financial projections prepared by management.

In October 2019, Thomas J. Axon, through Cangrejeros LLC, acquired operating control of the Cangrejeros Franchise. Axon became the sole member and chairman of Cangrejeros LLC in February 2022. The League consists of six separately owned and operated franchises, all located in Puerto Rico. The League's teams compete for fans, player talent, sponsorships, merchandise sales, and broadcast rights. The Cangrejeros Franchise played its home games at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, which was in poor condition. Axon proposed investing $2 million to repair the stadium in exchange for a 15-year exclusive lease, but the Mayor of San Juan, Miguel Romero Lugo, rejected the proposal. Axon then considered relocating the franchise to another municipality. After Axon publicly criticized the stadium's condition and San Juan's lack of investment, League President Juan A. Flores Galarza, with the agreement of other franchise owners and allegedly in concert with the Mayor, took steps to remove Axon from control of the franchise. Flores cited conduct 'detrimental to baseball' and suspended Axon from the League for two years, fined him, and placed him on probation. The League Board, composed of representatives from the other franchises, later terminated Cangrejeros LLC's investor-operator agreement and seized the plaintiffs' rights in the franchise without compensation. The League then selected Impulse Sports as the new operator of the Cangrejeros Franchise, with public support from the Mayor of San Juan.",

In November 2017, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, Grand wrote and circulated a seven-page, single-spaced letter to approximately forty friends and colleagues in the music industry. In the letter, Grand described her intermittent sexual relationship with Coleman, who was thirty-five years her senior, and alleged that Coleman sexually harassed her and pressured her to have a sexual relationship in exchange for his mentorship and professional opportunities. The letter included specific allegations, such as Coleman pressuring Grand to be intimate with him during teaching sessions, making her share hotel rooms with him during work travel, persistently asking for sex and becoming angry when she refused, offering work and training in exchange for sex, calling her in the middle of the night and not accepting refusals, and on one occasion, getting into bed with her and kissing her while she was asleep. Grand referred to Coleman as 'X' in the letter to avoid legal repercussions and stated that she did not intend for the letter to be made public. She acknowledged her own role in the relationship, admitting to being manipulative at times and expressing gratitude for Coleman's mentorship.

Grand filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that her letter was a non-actionable statement of opinion and that its content was substantially true.

The Act also requires media platforms to conduct due diligence to ensure they do not distribute prohibited communications, and imposes civil and criminal penalties for violations. The Act was motivated by concerns over foreign influence in Maine elections, particularly following significant campaign spending by Maine's two primary utility companies, Central Maine Power (CMP) and Versant Power, and their affiliates, which have foreign ownership ties. CMP is owned by Avangrid Inc., which is majority-owned by Spain-based Iberdrola, S.A., and has indirect ownership by Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. Versant is wholly owned by the City of Calgary, Canada.

      "factual_background":"Justin and Jared Brackett own and operate two restaurants in Harwich, Massachusetts: Ember Pizza, Inc. (Ember) and The Port Restaurant and Bar, Inc. (The Port). Both restaurants held liquor and entertainment licenses issued by the Town of Harwich. The entertainment licenses permitted amplified or acoustic music indoors and outdoors, but both restaurants were required to comply with the Harwich Noise Ordinance, which prohibits noise plainly audible at 150 feet from the source. In September 2019, Harwich found that Ember had violated the Noise Ordinance based on multiple complaints, resulting in a suspension and restriction of Ember's entertainment license. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ember did not serve at least some of this suspension, and was later accused of additional violations. In August 2020, the Board rescinded the prior suspensions and imposed a new seven-day suspension of Ember's entertainment license. Ember and The Port allege that false noise complaints were lodged against them and that the Town selectively enforced the Noise Ordinance, while other restaurants were not disciplined for similar conduct. Both restaurants were also cited for violating Massachusetts COVID-19 restrictions, which at the time allowed only takeout food and alcohol sales. The Harwich Police referred alleged violations by The Port and Ember to the Town. Ember and The Port allege that COVID-19 restrictions were also selectively enforced against them. In November 2020, Ember and The Port applied for renewal of their entertainment licenses. The Board renewed Ember's licenses in April 2021 but imposed an acoustic-only restriction. The day after, The Port's expanded outdoor dining permit was revoked, and in May 2021, the Board imposed an acoustic-only restriction on The Port and delayed renewal of its liquor license, eventually suspending it for three days for COVID-19 violations. Ember and The Port filed multiple lawsuits in state court and appealed to the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission.",

Tudor suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from sexual harassment and assault by a supervisor at a previous workplace. Her PTSD symptoms include neurological impairment, difficulty performing daily tasks, a stutter, severe nightmares, and the need for multiple medications and psychiatric care. In 2008, Tudor, in consultation with her therapist, requested and received an accommodation from Whitehall allowing her to leave campus for one fifteen-minute break during each of her morning and afternoon prep periods, which she used to manage her symptoms. In 2016, after a change in school administration, Whitehall implemented a policy prohibiting teachers from leaving school grounds during prep periods. Tudor was reprimanded for attempting to take her breaks and was told her documentation was insufficient to support her accommodation. She subsequently took paid sick leave and then FMLA leave, during which she attended an intensive outpatient program. Upon returning in January 2017, Whitehall allowed her a morning break and an afternoon break only when a librarian could cover her class; otherwise, she could not take the afternoon break. This arrangement continued through the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years. For the 2019-20 school year, Tudor's schedule included a morning prep period and an afternoon study hall, but no staff were available to cover her for an afternoon break. Tudor nonetheless left for breaks during study hall on 91 of 100 days before the pandemic forced remote learning, but did so without express authorization and with increased anxiety due to violating school policy.",

These regulations, mandatory as of January 1, 2022, require covered foods to disclose, in one of several prescribed formats, that the food is 'bioengineered' or contains a 'bioengineered' ingredient.

The regulations also require the use of the term 'bioengineered' for disclosures and provide several disclosure options, including text, symbol, electronic\/digital link (such as QR codes), and, after a required study found electronic\/digital links insufficient, a text-message option.

In October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused over three feet of saltwater to inundate the factory, resulting in significant physical damage and economic losses. Madelaine Chocolate filed a claim for more than $53 million under an insurance policy issued by Great Northern Insurance Company. Great Northern paid only about $4 million, invoking the policy's flood-exclusion provision, which excludes losses caused by the rising, overflowing, or breaking of any boundary of a body of water, whether driven by wind or not. The policy also contains an anti-concurrent causation (ACC) clause, which bars coverage for losses with multiple contributing causes if at least one is excluded. Great Northern asserted that the damage was caused, at least in part, by wind-driven flooding and thus excluded under the ACC clause. Madelaine Chocolate argued that its losses were caused by a 'windstorm,' a specified peril under the policy, and pointed to a 'Windstorm Or Hail Deductible Or Waiting Period' endorsement (the Windstorm Endorsement) that defines 'windstorm' to include 'wind-driven rain' and contains its own ACC clause.

Specific incidents alleged include a protestor raising a bike at a Jewish student and making a Holocaust-related comment, Jewish students being denied access to certain campus areas during protests, and a Jewish student being shoved while recording a protest. Plaintiffs also cite the display of posters and social media posts they characterize as antisemitic, as well as faculty and staff statements and events they allege contributed to a hostile environment. The protests culminated in a pro-Palestinian encampment on Kresge Lawn in April-May 2024, which was adjacent to Hillel, MIT's Jewish student center. The encampment and related protests led some Jewish students to move events off campus and request remote attendance for classes. MIT responded to the protests with revised policies, communications, and, eventually, disciplinary actions and arrests.",

None of her doctors suspected or diagnosed scleroderma during this period.

      "factual_background":"In 2020, the Vermont Superior Court transitioned from paper to electronic filing of court documents using a system called Odyssey. Prior to this transition, members of the public and media could review newly filed paper complaints in person at courthouses, with court staff conducting a quick audit to confirm the absence of confidential information before allowing access. After the transition, the Superior Court adopted a policy of withholding public access to newly filed civil complaints until a court clerk had reviewed them. This pre-access review was to ensure that complaints did not contain unredacted confidential personal or financial information (such as social security or financial account numbers), were properly signed, complied with technical requirements under court rules, and did not reveal filers\u2019 notes. The review process caused delays in making complaints publicly available. The press and public could generally review electronically filed documents only at designated terminals in courthouses during business hours, unless the Court Administrator allowed remote access. The Vermont rules placed primary responsibility on filers to avoid including confidential information, but clerks could withhold, redact, or reject filings if they found noncompliance. During the relevant period, out of 4,156 complaints, only three were rejected for containing confidential information, but across all filings, 138 were rejected for this reason. The delays in public access to complaints varied by county and over time, with some counties making as few as 3.8% of complaints available on the day of filing, and others up to 81.6%. The COVID-19 pandemic, staffing shortages, and equipment challenges contributed to these delays.

By 2018, she held the position of Level 18 postmaster. In January 2018, at age 58, Warner applied for a Level 20 postmaster position in Durham, New Hampshire, which offered higher pay and benefits. Kathleen Hayes, Warner's supervisor and the Post Office Operations Manager for the Northern New England District, interviewed Warner for the Durham position. Warner was not selected; instead, the job went to John Minigan, a 36-year-old man. Hayes told Warner that Minigan was chosen because he had more experience relevant to the job. In August 2018, Warner applied for another Level 20 postmaster position in Somersworth, New Hampshire. Hayes again conducted the interview and commented that the Somersworth post office had never had a female postmaster and questioned how that would work, also asking Warner if she had the 'energy' to manage the office. Warner was again not selected; the position went to David Adams, a 53-year-old man. Warner believed she was denied both promotions due to her age and sex. She filed complaints with an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor and the USPS National EEO Investigative Services Office, later requesting a hearing with the EEOC, but ultimately withdrew her EEOC charge before filing suit in federal district court.",

Zoll became a Fusion customer, acquiring services for electronic messaging and email communications, but the contract between Fusion and Zoll (the Hosting Agreement) did not include the required limitation of liability or indemnification provisions.

In October 2018, Shapiro submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the United States Social Security Administration (SSA) seeking documents related to how the SSA assesses disability claims for migraines and other headache disorders. Specifically, he requested all documents pertaining to the SSA's assessment, evaluation, and decisions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of migraine and other headache disorders in the SSA's Listing of Impairments, as well as documents informing guidance for SSA adjudicators and administrative law judges on how to assess and determine medical equivalency for such disorders. Shapiro stated that his purpose was to further scholarship on migraine disability and to inform the public about the SSA's evaluation process for these disorders. The SSA responded more than six months later, classifying Shapiro's request as 'unusual' and 'non-program related,' and required him to pay $2,908 in processing fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306(c), which allows the SSA to recover the full cost of responding to FOIA requests not directly related to the administration of an SSA program. Shapiro paid the fee, and the SSA produced two memoranda, withholding 1,377 pages of documents under FOIA Exemption 5 and redacting personal information under Exemption 6.

The court also ordered the SSA to specify a basis for withholding certain documents under FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6, and later ruled that the SSA had properly withheld the disputed documents under Exemption 5.

In August 2021, Washington Governor Jay Inslee issued a proclamation requiring all healthcare workers, including firefighters, to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by October 2021. The proclamation allowed for religious accommodations unless such accommodations would cause undue hardship for the employer. SRFR informed its firefighters of the vaccination requirement and the process for requesting religious exemptions. Forty-six out of 192 firefighters, including the eight plaintiffs, requested religious exemptions. All plaintiffs held EMT or paramedic certifications. SRFR\u2019s Human Resources staff met with each employee requesting an exemption to discuss possible accommodations. SRFR negotiated with the firefighters\u2019 union and approved a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that allowed unvaccinated firefighters to use accrued paid leave, then take a one-year unpaid leave of absence, and provided for priority rehire if they returned within two years. In October 2021, SRFR determined it could not accommodate unvaccinated firefighters in their roles without undue hardship, citing the inability to provide alternative positions or facilitate accommodations such as masking, testing, and social distancing. All exemption requests were denied for continued frontline work, but leave options were provided. In May 2022, after the Omicron wave subsided, SRFR allowed unvaccinated employees to return to work. Four plaintiffs returned shortly after, and others returned later.",

The record shows that nearly 25% of the workforce sought exemptions, and SRFR provided unrebutted evidence that alternative accommodations (masking, testing, etc.) were insufficient to mitigate the health and safety risks, especially given the nature of firefighting and emergency medical services. The operational and financial burdens, including the risk of losing contracts and potential liability, were supported by evidence and not merely speculative. The fact that other departments may have reached different conclusions does not mean SRFR\u2019s assessment was unreasonable, especially given the size of the exemption requests and the public-facing nature of the work. The leave of absence, while not ideal for plaintiffs, was a reasonable accommodation in light of the circumstances and the substantial hardship posed by other options."

      "factual_background":"This case arises from the criminal actions of two former Massachusetts state forensic chemists, Annie Dookhan and Sonja Farak, who tampered with drug evidence, falsified test results, and committed perjury in state court drug cases beginning around 2004. Their misconduct, discovered about a decade later, led the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) to vacate and dismiss with prejudice over 30,000 drug cases tainted by their involvement. Individuals whose convictions were vacated sought the return of fees, assessments, restitution, fines, court costs, and civilly forfeited assets associated with their convictions. The SJC held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the automatic return of most funds paid as a consequence of the convictions, but not the forfeited assets, which were seized under a civil statute. The SJC reasoned that civil forfeiture judgments were not solely a consequence of the invalidated drug convictions and required individuals to file motions for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure to seek return of their property.",

They argued that the continued withholding of their forfeited property after the SJC vacated their underlying drug convictions violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The original defendants included the Massachusetts Attorney General, eleven district attorneys, the administrator of the state trial court, the interim superintendent of the state police, and four local police departments (the latter dismissed under Monell v. Department of Social Services of New York). Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a declaration of entitlement to the return of all forfeited property, injunctions for the return of property, notice to class members, a full accounting, and implementation of fair procedures for return.",

The plaintiffs allege that the continued withholding of property after the vacatur of their convictions is an ongoing constitutional violation. Under Ex parte Young, federal courts may grant prospective relief against state officials for ongoing violations of federal law. The relief sought (notice, accounting, and procedural changes) is forward-looking and does not require the court to order the return of property directly, which would be retrospective. The fact that state officials may have some role in the relevant procedures supports the application of Ex parte Young. Therefore, the district court correctly denied the motion to dismiss these claims."

His offense was nonviolent but involved defrauding federally insured banks of tens of millions of dollars and causing over one million dollars in tax loss.

      "factual_background":"From 1990 to 1999, Patrick Rose, Sr., a Boston Police Department (BPD) officer, sexually abused two children, John and Jane Doe, who lived with him and his wife, Frances Rose. John was abused from approximately 1990 through 1997 (ages 8-14), and Jane from 1990 through 1999 (ages 5-14). Rose also abused four other family member children from at least 1990 through 2020. On November 8, 1995, the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) received a report that Rose had abused John. The BPD began its own investigation, assigning Lt. Marie Donahue and Sgt. Det. John McLean. On November 10, 1995, they interviewed John in a police car in front of Rose's home, with Rose and Frances watching. John disclosed the abuse, and Rose was arrested for Indecent Assault and Battery on a Child Under 14, served with a restraining order, and placed on administrative duty. The BPD confiscated Rose's weapons. DCF conducted its investigation, but, following Lt. Donahue's instructions, did not visit the Rose home or re-interview John. DCF interviewed Jane in front of Frances. DCF substantiated the abuse and referred the case to the district attorney. Sgt. Det. McLean filed a criminal complaint, and Rose was arraigned on December 1, 1995, represented by a BPPA attorney. Rose was sentenced to pre-trial probation and ordered to attend therapy, but did not comply, and the restraining order was withdrawn in January 1996 with DCF's consent. In May 1996, the criminal complaint was dismissed, allegedly because Rose met probation requirements and the victims were unwilling to cooperate. Internally, the BPD's IAD sustained a complaint against Rose for violating a rule against criminal acts, but no further investigation or discipline occurred. In May 1998, BPD Commissioner Paul Evans reinstated Rose to full duty without sanctions, after Rose's attorney submitted affidavits recanting the allegations. Rose continued to serve as a police officer until 2018 and was BPPA president from 2014 to 2018. After the 1995 complaint, Rose continued to abuse John, Jane, and other children. In 2020, John reported the abuse again, leading to Rose's indictment and guilty plea in 2022.",

During this time, he experienced chronic knee pain. In September 2018, Waltermeyer requested diagnostic imaging for his knee, and Dr. Kistler, the prison doctor, ordered and obtained approval for an MRI, which was conducted a little over two months later. The MRI results, reviewed by Dr. Kistler, included notes indicating 'no surgery needed,' 'physical therapy,' and 'ultimate solution: knee total replacement,' along with recommendations for non-surgical treatments such as supplements, knee bracing, exercise, and pain medication. Dr. Kistler informed Waltermeyer that an outside specialist recommended deferring knee surgery until he was older. Dr. Kistler declined to order surgery at that time but provided non-surgical treatments. Waltermeyer received multiple types of non-surgical medical treatments, including bi-annual cortisone injections (though he wanted them monthly), pain medication, special shoes, knee braces, access to a low bunk, and a cane. He alleges that despite these treatments, he continued to experience pain and that Dr. Kistler often told him he would have to get used to the pain.

Although Twitch shut down the stream two minutes after the violence began, images and videos from the attack spread on fringe social media sites. In response to the shooting, the New York State legislature enacted the Hateful Conduct Law (N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 394-ccc), effective December 3, 2022. The law requires social media networks to provide a clear and accessible mechanism for users to report incidents of 'hateful conduct' and to have a clear and concise policy on how they will respond to such reports. 'Hateful conduct' is defined as using a social media network to vilify, humiliate, or incite violence against a group or class of persons based on protected characteristics. The law authorizes civil penalties for noncompliance and grants enforcement powers to the Attorney General. Plaintiffs are Eugene Volokh (operator of The Volokh Conspiracy blog), Rumble Canada Inc.

Dr. Byrnes continued to raise concerns about the adequacy of the investigation. In November 2019, SCH reappointed Dr. Byrnes to the medical staff after review by the department chair, MEC, and SCH Board. In December 2019, the MEC requested Dr. Byrnes undergo a psychological evaluation, which he challenged as retaliatory. The MEC later retracted the request. On January 27, 2020, SCH received a subpoena from the Kansas Board of Healing Arts (KBHA) regarding an anonymous complaint against Dr. Byrnes, alleging patient care issues and inappropriate conduct. Dr. Byrnes informed Dr. Green-Cheatwood, Centura\u2019s Vice President and Physician Executive, that he believed Dr. Kessler filed the complaint in retaliation. Centura\u2019s Dr. Green-Cheatwood and General Counsel Peter Sabey conducted an internal investigation, interviewing several SCH staff but not Dr. Byrnes or any nurses. On February 10, 2020, Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey recommended Dr. Byrnes\u2019s termination to Centura leadership, who decided to fire him. Dr. Byrnes was terminated on February 12, 2020. After his termination, SCH referred some of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases for outside peer review at another Centura hospital. Based on the peer review findings, SCH reported four of Dr. Byrnes\u2019s cases to the KBHA for possible disciplinary action. The KBHA later closed its investigations into Dr. Byrnes without action.",

Manchester police officers Rachael Eutzy and Erik Slocum, on patrol in a marked cruiser, observed that Velez's vehicle had a broken headlight and taillight. The officers followed Velez, who made a series of turns and then parked near his residence. The officers believed Velez was attempting to elude them, but Velez denied this and claimed he did not see the police car's blue lights until he was parked. The address where Velez parked was known to police for prior associations with drugs and prostitution. The officers approached Velez's vehicle; Velez was sitting inside with his hands up and did not roll down his window, stating it was broken. Officer Eutzy, in full uniform, opened the driver's side door and instructed Velez to stop talking and to exit the vehicle. Velez verbally protested and reached into his pocket for his cell phone, prompting Eutzy to order him to remove his hands from his pockets and to exit the car. Velez refused, leading Eutzy to grab his arm and attempt to pull him out. Velez resisted, and a physical struggle ensued. Officer Slocum joined, pulling on Velez's neck area, instructing him to get out, and stating he was under arrest. Velez continued to resist, bracing himself against the car frame and shouting for help. Slocum struck Velez twice in the abdomen, twice in the head, and tased him twice. After the second tasing, the officers pulled Velez from the car and onto the ground, where they attempted to handcuff him. A third officer arrived, and Velez was handcuffed and moved to a standing position. By this time, seven officers were present. Velez was taken to the police station and charged with two misdemeanors and a traffic violation. He pled guilty to the traffic violation; the misdemeanors were dropped. Velez sustained injuries during the incident.",

Many individuals who lost property in these seizures fled to the United States. In 1996, Congress enacted the Helms-Burton Act, which created a private cause of action for U.S. nationals with claims to property confiscated by the Cuban government, allowing them to sue any person who 'traffics' in such property. The Act defines 'trafficking' broadly to include a range of commercial activities involving confiscated property. From the Act's passage until May 2019, every U.S. President suspended the private right of action under the Act. After the suspension was lifted in 2019, the plaintiffs, as successors-in-interest to the assets of Banco Pujol and Banco Nu\u00f1ez, brought actions against Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and BNP Paribas, alleging that the banks trafficked in their confiscated property by providing BNC with U.S. dollar financing, credit, deliveries of U.S. currency, and non-U.S. dollar financing. The complaints allege that from at least 2000 to 2010, both banks provided significant U.S. dollar-denominated credit facilities and processed billions of dollars in transactions for Cuban entities, including BNC.

The district court likely erred if it found otherwise, but the summary does not indicate that standing was the basis for dismissal. Thus, the appellate court will likely affirm that standing exists."

      "factual_background":"From 2000 to 2001, Jesus Santiago committed several state and federal felonies in New York and Virginia. In January 2000, he shot someone in Brooklyn, New York, and was indicted in state court for assault and weapons charges. After being released on bond, he fled New York. In 2001, he was arrested in Virginia on federal drug charges, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 37 months in prison and four years of supervised release. While incarcerated, Santiago contacted the New York state court to resolve his pending charges and was transferred to New York in 2002. He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in exchange for a sentence of three and a half years (to run concurrently with his federal sentence) and a five-year post-release supervision (PRS) term. However, at his sentencing hearing, there was no mention of PRS in the record, and the commitment order did not include PRS. After serving his federal sentence, Santiago was transferred to New York state custody in 2004, and the Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) assumed he was subject to mandatory PRS under New York law. Santiago was released early from state prison in 2004 and began serving what DOCS believed was his mandatory PRS, while also serving federal supervised release. He violated the terms of both by moving to Virginia, where he was arrested in 2005 and again in 2006. After serving additional federal time, he was returned to New York in June 2007 and reincarcerated for violating state PRS. He was released in February 2008, but soon violated supervision again and was arrested in Virginia. In September 2010, after further federal incarceration, Santiago was transferred back to New York for violating state PRS. By this time, the law regarding PRS in New York had changed following the Second Circuit's 2006 decision in Earley v. Murray, which held that PRS must be orally pronounced at sentencing. In 2010, Santiago was resentenced in state court without a PRS term and released.",

Plaintiffs claim that, in adhering to this policy, bishops in the Archdiocese of New York, the Diocese of Brooklyn, the Diocese of Rockville Centre, the Diocese of Albany, the Diocese of Syracuse, and the Diocese of Ogdensburg failed to warn children and parents of the dangers posed by accused clerics and failed to report suspected abuse to law enforcement.

On June 10, 2021, the VHRC released the Investigative Report to Seven Days, a local newspaper operated by Da Capo Publishing, Inc., which published an article on June 23, 2021, making the report public. Leise alleges that Christie and Yang participated in providing the report to the newspaper, that the report was based on intentionally false and misleading facts, and that its release violated Vermont law requiring confidentiality. He claims the release damaged his reputation, forced his resignation from the VSP, and harmed his future employment prospects. Leise further alleges that Christie and Yang authored the report and released it to promote VHRC leadership and shape public opinion against the VSP and its troopers.",

The law is not clearly established that releasing a critical report, even if damaging, violates substantive due process.

      "factual_background":"In April 2006, the T\/V Margara, a 748-foot double-hulled oil tanker carrying over 300,000 barrels of oil, ran aground approximately three miles off the coast of Tallaboa, Puerto Rico. Ernst Jacob GmbH & Co. KG owned or operated the vessel, and Shipowners Insurance & Guaranty Company, Ltd. (SIGCo) acted as an insurer. The crew notified the U.S. Coast Guard after failing to free the vessel. Captain James Tunstall, the pre-designated Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), oversaw the response. The Coast Guard deployed booms to contain oil in case of a spill and oversaw the vessel's return to deeper waters. No oil was spilled, and the hull survey revealed only cosmetic damage. However, the response efforts to free the vessel and mitigate the risk of a spill resulted in the destruction or destabilization of nearly 7,000 square meters of coral reef. NOAA and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (PRDNER) worked together to assess and restore the damaged natural resources, including coral, reef biota, and habitat. In 2015, they published a restoration plan and later presented claims for restoration costs to the vessel's representatives and insurers, which were denied or not answered. NOAA and PRDNER then sought and received compensation from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (the Fund) managed by the U.S. Coast Guard's National Pollution Funds Center (NPFC). The NPFC paid over $4.4 million for primary restoration and additional contingency funds. NOAA and PRDNER later finalized a natural resource damages assessment, estimating further restoration costs at nearly $29.4 million, and presented additional claims for compensatory restoration and assessment costs to SIGCo and Ernst Jacob.",

Tudor suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) stemming from sexual harassment and assault by a supervisor at a previous workplace. Her PTSD symptoms include neurological impairment, difficulty performing daily tasks, a stutter, severe nightmares, and the need for multiple medications and psychiatric care. In 2008, Tudor and her therapist requested and received an accommodation from Whitehall, allowing her to leave campus for a 15-minute break during each of her morning and afternoon prep periods, which helped her manage her symptoms. In 2016, after a change in school administration, Whitehall implemented a policy prohibiting teachers from leaving school grounds during prep periods. Tudor was reprimanded for attempting to take her breaks and was told her documentation was insufficient. She subsequently took paid sick leave and then FMLA leave due to her PTSD. Upon returning in January 2017, Whitehall allowed her a morning break and, when possible, an afternoon break if a librarian could cover her class. This arrangement continued through the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years. For the 2019-20 school year, Tudor's schedule included a morning prep period and an afternoon study hall, but no staff were available to cover her for an afternoon break.

Count One charged him with aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2114(a), which criminalizes the robbery or assault of a person in lawful charge of money or property of the United States, with intent to rob. The incident involved the assault of a government informant who possessed government-provided money for a controlled firearm purchase; the victim was shot several times and died. Count Three charged Forteza with aiding and abetting a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j), alleging that the \u00a7 2114(a) violation described in Count One was committed with a firearm and that, in the course of that crime of violence, the victim was unlawfully killed through the use of a firearm. Forteza pleaded guilty to Count Three (\u00a7 924(j)), and the government dropped the remaining charges, including the \u00a7 2114(a) charge.

He is the father of Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Menezes, who entered the United States on a tourist visa in 2013, lived with Eduardo in Massachusetts, attended and graduated from high school, and later studied on a student visa. On January 12, 2018, Eduardo filed a Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to sponsor Carlos, who was then 20 years old, for an immigrant visa in the F2A category (children under 21 of LPRs). Carlos turned 21 during the pendency of the petition. USCIS approved the petition on August 12, 2019, after about 19 months. At that time, a visa in the F2A category was immediately available. Carlos submitted a visa application and was scheduled for an interview at the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for October 15, 2021. Before the interview, on May 27, 2021, Eduardo naturalized as a U.S. citizen. In March 2022, the consulate informed Carlos by email that, because he was over 21 at the time of his father's naturalization, he was not eligible for Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) benefits, his application was reclassified to the F1 category (adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens), and his priority date was not current, resulting in a lengthy wait for visa availability.",

Later that year, he played abbreviated seasons of basketball, football, and track, and performed well academically. For the 2021-2022 academic year, Doe transferred to an out-of-state boarding school and was reclassified as a freshman, repeating ninth grade to gain maturity and preparation for the school's academic rigor. He played sports each season at the boarding school. Although he finished the year with strong grades, Doe struggled socially and academically, lost weight, and began to show symptoms of a depressive disorder. He was subsequently diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ADHD, and other learning disorders. Doe then transferred back to Rhode Island for the 2022-2023 academic year, enrolling as a sophomore at a different private school, where he received an Individual Support Plan and other academic accommodations. His wellbeing improved, and he played varsity football and basketball. Doe's parents learned that, under the Rhode Island Interscholastic League's Eight-Semester Rule, he would be ineligible to play sports in his senior year (2024-2025), as he would have completed eight consecutive semesters since first entering ninth grade in 2020. The Rule limits students to eight consecutive semesters of eligibility for interscholastic athletics, starting from entry into ninth grade. Doe's parents requested a waiver of the Rule as a reasonable accommodation for his disabilities, arguing that his disabilities were the sole reason for the request.

      "factual_background":"In November 2004, Julio Rodr\u00edguez-M\u00e9ndez participated in a carjacking in Puerto Rico while possessing a firearm. This conduct led to successive prosecutions in both the Puerto Rico Commonwealth courts and the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Rodr\u00edguez was first prosecuted in Commonwealth court for robbery of a motor vehicle in violation of Article 173B of the Puerto Rico Penal Code and for carrying a weapon without a license in violation of Article 5.04 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. After this conviction, a federal grand jury indicted Rodr\u00edguez on three counts arising from the same carjacking: aiding and abetting a carjacking, aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon (felon-in-possession). Because he had at least three prior convictions for robbery of a motor vehicle under Article 173B, he was also charged as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). Rodr\u00edguez pleaded guilty to the felon-in-possession count, and the other charges were dismissed. He was sentenced in November 2006 to 216 months of imprisonment, in part due to the ACCA's enhanced penalties. Rodr\u00edguez filed a notice of appeal but voluntarily dismissed it in October 2008 and did not collaterally attack his conviction within a year of it becoming final. In 2015 and 2016, two significant Supreme Court decisions affected the legal landscape: Johnson v. United States (holding the ACCA's residual clause unconstitutionally vague) and Puerto Rico v. S\u00e1nchez Valle (holding that Puerto Rico and the United States are one sovereign for double jeopardy purposes). About three months after S\u00e1nchez Valle, Rodr\u00edguez filed a pro se motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, seeking to vacate his felon-in-possession conviction on double jeopardy grounds. After appointment of counsel, he amended his motion to also challenge his ACCA enhancement, arguing that his prior Article 173B convictions no longer qualified as ACCA predicates after Johnson.",

In January 2022, Orabona informed her supervisor that she had a job offer from Citizens Bank but was considering staying at Santander if her salary could be renegotiated. On January 21, 2022, Orabona was terminated for cause by a Santander employee from Spain, accompanied by HR and IT staff, for allegedly forwarding company emails to her personal email address, which was deemed a violation of Santander's Code of Conduct client privacy policy. Orabona claims she was told all her benefits, including healthcare, would cease immediately, and that if she appealed or applied for benefits, Santander would report her to the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) for misconduct. Orabona asserts she forwarded emails only due to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, that the emails were encrypted and did not contain personal information, and that other employees had done the same without being terminated. She also claims she received no warning or reprimand prior to her termination. Around late 2021, Santander decided to exit the U.S. residential mortgage market, which would result in layoffs of all MDOs in Orabona's department. On February 1, 2022, shortly after Orabona's termination, Santander announced a national layoff in its residential lending department, eliminating her position.

Formal complaints were filed by J.T., C.T., and E.H., leading to Doe's suspension from RA duties and an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct. Hannah Monbleau, Assistant Director of Student Life and Well-Being, conducted the investigation, interviewing complainants and other students, including S.K. and G.D. After S.K.'s interview, she also filed a complaint. Monbleau interviewed Doe twice and another student, A.M., at Doe's recommendation. Monbleau's investigative report concluded Doe's conduct met the Student Conduct Code's definition of sexual misconduct, which includes 'unwelcomed conduct of a sexual nature' that interferes with work or academic performance or creates a hostile environment. The case was assigned to a three-member Conduct Panel (Kate Legee, Adam Dunbar, Esmeralda Levesque), which reviewed the report, Doe's response, and held a hearing (Doe did not attend). The panel identified three verbal comments Doe made to G.D., C.T., and S.K.; one incident where Doe adjusted J.T.'s feet on exercise equipment; and repeated instances where Doe extended his arms to J.T. to invite or initiate a hug. The panel found these actions unwelcome and concluded they created an offensive working environment for multiple female students.

      "factual_background":"In 2019, New York enacted the Reproductive Health Act (RHA), which fully decriminalized abortion and eliminated the criminal offense of fetal homicide. Prior to the RHA, abortion after twenty-four weeks of gestation was a crime unless necessary to save the mother's life, and causing the death of a fetus after twenty-four weeks was considered homicide. The RHA removed these offenses from the penal law and permitted licensed health care practitioners to perform abortions within twenty-four weeks or later if the fetus is not viable or the mother's life or health is at risk. The RHA also removed fetal homicide from the homicide statute, so causing the death of a fetus is no longer considered homicide in New York. In response, a group of plaintiffs, including Mary Doe (a social worker), filed suit challenging the RHA, alleging it violated the constitutional rights of expectant mothers, doctors, social workers, and fetuses. Doe specifically sought to challenge the RHA's decriminalization of abortion and repeal of fetal homicide on behalf of a class of viable fetuses in New York, claiming violations of the fetuses' rights to life and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and rights to legal redress under the First Amendment. Doe sought damages and equitable relief, including a declaration that the RHA is unconstitutional and an injunction barring enforcement.",

Bard referred the matter to the Department's Professional Standards Unit (PSU) for investigation. Hussey was placed on administrative leave during the investigation. In a written statement to the PSU, Hussey clarified that he supported police reform and condemned George Floyd's murder, but objected to naming the bill in Floyd's honor, describing Floyd as a 'violent criminal.'

      "factual_background":"Carmen Quintana-Dieppa, a 62-year-old Puerto Rican woman, began working for the Department of the Army in 1988 and served as the Child Youth and School Services (CYSS) Coordinator at Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, since 2009. In September 2014, Quintana filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging discrimination based on her national origin. While her EEOC complaint was pending, the Army's 81st Regional Support Command received allegations of mismanagement and poor working conditions in the Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation (FMWR) Division at Fort Buchanan, which included Quintana and other supervisors. In May 2016, the Army launched an investigation into the FMWR supervisory chain. The investigating officer found that Quintana's leadership style fostered a toxic work environment and that she did not always treat subordinates with dignity and respect, recommending her removal from her supervisory position, suspension, transfer to a nonsupervisory role, and transition into retirement. The Commanding General accepted the findings but left disciplinary action to Colonel Michael T. Harvey, who requested a second investigation into Quintana's treatment of subordinates. The second investigation, conducted from August to October 2016, confirmed the first investigation's findings, with 27 individuals reporting disrespectful or disparaging behavior by Quintana, as well as favoritism, intimidation, and retaliatory tactics. As a result, disciplinary action was recommended. Quintana subsequently received a 'satisfactory' performance evaluation for July 2015\u2013June 2016, a downgrade from the previous year's 'outstanding' rating, which she attributed to the investigation and professional jealousy. She did not receive a performance evaluation for 2016\u20132017, consistent with other employees under her supervisor at the time. In January 2017, Col. Harvey signed a letter reassigning Quintana to a nonsupervisory role, but a hiring freeze delayed the reassignment. In May 2017, Quintana requested a non-competitive promotion to a higher position, but was told the program did not meet the required demographics. In June 2017, after a change in FMWR leadership, the new Programs Director, Tod Antony Scalf, reviewed the investigation files and determined that removing Quintana from management was justified. In November 2017, Quintana was reassigned to a new position with the same pay and grade, with the reassignment letter citing concerns about her management style. After her reassignment, two Hispanic women, Wendy Winston and then Aida Aguil\u00fa (about a year younger than Quintana), temporarily and then permanently assumed her former duties.",

Debt-collection actions are common in New York, and many defendants fail to appear, resulting in default judgments, often in cases that may be meritless. New York has provided a simplified form for pro se defendants, but Upsolve contends that the form still requires legal knowledge that many low-income defendants lack. Justice Advocates would be trained to determine if a client could benefit from advice, confirm the limited scope of representation, advise on whether and how to answer a lawsuit, assist in filling out the answer form, and advise on filing and serving the answer. Justice Advocates would be required to undergo training, abide by professional conduct rules, and provide services free of charge. Reverend Udo-Okon, a pastor in the South Bronx, has witnessed community members struggle to access legal help and wishes to participate as a Justice Advocate.

The Funds distribute dividends to shareholders, who are mostly Puerto Rico residents. Each fund holds annual meetings for the election of directors. In May 2021, a group of PRRTFF IV shareholders, including William Hawk (an executive of Ocean Capital), sent letters proposing the addition of an objective to liquidate PRRTFF IV by January 31, 2022. These letters, signed by various individuals and entities, were delivered via Hawk and First Southern, a financial services company affiliated with PRCE Management LLC. Subsequently, Ocean Capital and Hawk launched proxy campaigns for Funds IV and V, forming a 'Coalition of Concerned UBS Closed-End Bond Fund Investors' (CCI) to nominate new directors, and issued proxy materials and public statements. Proxy campaigns and similar filings were later launched for other funds. Defendants-Appellees filed Schedule 13Ds for several funds, disclosing share ownership and a Joint Filing and Solicitation Agreement, but did not disclose information about the Stockholder Group. The Funds allege that these filings and proxy materials omitted or misstated material information about group membership, intentions regarding liquidation, tax status, nominee qualifications, fund performance, and other matters.

Q-Pod, separate from the main prison building, contains 60 cells with two bunks each and is used to house inmates transitioning from more restrictive confinement, such as punitive segregation, back to the general population. Department of Corrections regulations classify Q-Pod as a 'reclassification unit,' but plaintiffs allege it is a punitive unit with harsher conditions than general population. When inmates violate the Code of Penal Discipline, they are sent to the Restrictive Housing Unit (RHU) and, upon release, are placed in Q-Pod for 60 or 90 days depending on the severity of the infraction. Plaintiffs allege they were often kept in Q-Pod for longer periods, with some reporting up to nine consecutive months. Plaintiffs complain about five main conditions: (1) significant isolation (22 hours per day in cells, with two hours of outdoor recreation, compared to three hours for general population; some inmates were alone in their cells); (2) unsanitary conditions, including restrictions on toilet flushing and alleged water shutoffs; (3) deprivation of medical care and drug\/alcohol counseling; (4) lack of vocational training, job assignments, and education; and (5) limited religious services. Seven plaintiffs allege only restricted or segregated religious services, while two (Baltas and Tarasco) claim they were denied access to Native American religious practices such as smudging and sweat lodge ceremonies.

      "factual_background":"Derek Kramer joined American Electric Power Service Corporation (AEP) in 2018 as vice president and chief digital officer of AEP Charge, the company's innovation hub. Nearly a year after being hired, Kramer was offered and accepted participation in the AEP Executive Severance Plan (the Plan), which provides severance payments to eligible employees upon involuntary termination or resignation for good reason. In 2020, AEP terminated Kramer's employment following two incidents. First, an audit revealed that Kramer's executive assistant had repeatedly charged personal expenses to her company credit card, which Kramer had approved, in violation of company policy. Despite being warned after the first incident, the behavior continued and was flagged again in a subsequent audit. Second, during the investigation into the credit card charges, AEP's security coordinator retrieved Kramer's company-issued cell phone. Kramer hesitated to provide the phone and its PIN, and after the phone was collected, forensic analysis showed that the device began wiping itself clean, which AEP suspected was done intentionally by Kramer. Kramer explained that he removed his personal Apple ID and iCloud account but did not intend to wipe the device. After further investigation, AEP concluded that Kramer had intentionally wiped the phone. Kramer was terminated on October 2, 2020, with his supervisor citing failure to properly oversee his assistant's expenses. Kramer then submitted a claim for severance benefits under the Plan, which was denied on the grounds that he was terminated 'for Cause' as defined by the Plan. The denial cited both the expense account violations and the wiping of the company phone as bases for the 'for Cause' determination. Kramer appealed the denial to the Plan's appeal committee, which upheld the decision.",

Between April 2018 and March 15, 2020, Amazon required employees at these facilities to undergo mandatory security screenings before leaving the secured area where merchandise is stored. The screenings were not required upon entry, only upon exit. The process varied: employees with no belongings could use an express lane and walk through a metal detector; those with items in their pockets used divesting tables to place items in a basket before passing through the metal detector; those with larger items (bags, lunch boxes, purses) placed them through an X-ray machine while passing through the metal detector. If an alarm was triggered, a secondary screening with a security guard using a wand was conducted. Employees could choose to store personal belongings in lockers to avoid the screening, but if they brought belongings into the secured area, they had to undergo the appropriate screening upon exit, including when accessing breakrooms outside the secured area or leaving during breaks or at the end of their shift. Timeclocks were positioned so that employees clocked out before going through security, and thus were not compensated for time spent in the security screening process.

Eylea is expensive, with a single injection costing $1,850 and annual copays for patients often exceeding $2,000. Some patients are deterred from using Eylea due to the high copay, and there are cheaper alternative drugs available for off-label use. Regeneron allegedly sought to increase Eylea sales by covering patient copayments through donations to the Chronic Disease Fund (CDF), a charitable foundation that provides copayment assistance to patients with wet AMD.

Jaudon requested a life claim form from Guardian, but Guardian denied the claim, asserting that the policy had been cancelled before Pam's death. Guardian contended that the policy was a group policy for multiple Allure employees, but that coverage dropped to only Pam in November 2019, triggering Guardian's contractual right to cancel.

In February 2002, N\u00fa\u00f1ez was also indicted in Puerto Rico superior court on charges stemming from the same incident, including carjacking, first degree murder, and two weapons possession counts under Puerto Rico law. N\u00fa\u00f1ez pleaded guilty to the federal carjacking charge in May 2002 and was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment; the federal firearms charges were dismissed. In November 2003, a Puerto Rico jury found N\u00fa\u00f1ez guilty of carjacking and weapons charges, as well as the lesser included offense of manslaughter under Puerto Rico law. He received a 69-year sentence to be served consecutively to his federal sentence. N\u00fa\u00f1ez appealed his Puerto Rico convictions, arguing, among other things, that his sentence was unconstitutional because he was already serving a federal sentence for the same conduct. The Puerto Rico Court of Appeals rejected his double jeopardy claim, holding that Puerto Rico and the federal government are separate sovereigns. N\u00fa\u00f1ez's petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico was denied in February 2007. In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Puerto Rico v.

The plaintiffs allege that Cultural Care violated their rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and various state wage and hour laws by failing to pay them legal wages for their work as au pairs.

The Act also bans the sale, within Massachusetts, of pork products derived from pigs that were confined in such a manner, regardless of where the pigs were raised. Plaintiffs are pig farmers and a pork processor located outside Massachusetts, in states including Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Missouri, Wyoming, and Indiana. Their pork products, produced from pigs housed in gestation crates, are sold nationwide, including in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Act became enforceable on August 24, 2023, after prior legal challenges. The stated purpose of the Act is to prevent animal cruelty by phasing out extreme methods of farm animal confinement, which the Act claims also threaten consumer health and safety, increase the risk of foodborne illness, and have negative fiscal impacts on Massachusetts.",

Plaintiffs then moved for partial summary judgment on the direct discrimination theory under the dormant Commerce Clause. Massachusetts opposed and requested summary judgment sua sponte.

Jason Frey holds a restricted 'sportsman' license from Westchester County, which allows him to carry concealed handguns in public only to and from target shooting activities and during sporting activities such as camping, hiking, and hunting. In 2019, Frey was denied an unrestricted concealed carry license for failure to show proper cause. He does not have a special permit to carry a handgun in New York City and asserts he should not have to apply for one. Frey avers that he regularly carries his handgun concealed outside the scope of his license in Westchester County and in New York City, including on the Metro-North train, the New York City subway, and in Times Square. He also states he intends to carry his handgun openly and holstered, but refrains from doing so due to fear of arrest and penalties. William Sappe holds an unrestricted concealed carry license from Orange County, New York, and is licensed as an armed guard by the State. He regularly transports valuables in and out of New York City's Diamond District, requiring travel through Times Square. Sappe previously applied for a special permit to carry in New York City, but was denied. He states he intends to carry his handgun concealed in New York City for self-defense and to carry it openly on days he is not carrying concealed, but fears arrest and incarceration for doing so. The underlying dispute centers on New York State's and New York City's firearms regulations, specifically the prohibition on carrying firearms in certain 'sensitive locations' (Times Square, the New York City subway, and the Metro-North rail system), the statewide ban on open carry, and the requirement that state concealed carry license holders obtain a City-specific permit to carry in New York City.",

The court also found that the City\u2019s special permit requirement was supported by a historical tradition of municipal firearm regulation.

The state sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as costs for investigation, monitoring, remediation, and restoration of natural resources. Maine filed two separate complaints: one (the 'AFFF Complaint') sought recovery for PFAS contamination caused by 3M's production of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF), a firefighting material containing PFAS, some of which was produced for the U.S. military (MilSpec AFFF) and used at military and other facilities; the other (the 'non-AFFF Complaint') sought recovery for PFAS contamination not caused by 3M's production of AFFF. The non-AFFF Complaint included a disclaimer stating that Maine was not seeking relief for contamination or injury related to AFFF. The complaints described PFAS contamination as widespread and ongoing, with PFAS entering the environment through industrial processes, product use, and disposal, and spreading via sludge and septage applied to land. Maine's non-AFFF Complaint initially identified 22 example sites but later, during discovery, identified 910 specific sites allegedly contaminated by non-AFFF PFAS. 3M contended that PFAS from AFFF, including MilSpec AFFF, had plausibly commingled with PFAS from non-AFFF sources at various locations, making it difficult to distinguish the sources of contamination.",

      "factual_background":"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. is a global drug-development company that provides animals for drug research and safety testing, as well as conducting research itself. A key part of its business involves the supply of long-tailed macaques, which are used in biologic drug development and safety testing. Prior to spring 2020, Charles River sourced over 60% of its long-tailed macaques from China, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, China halted wildlife exports, forcing Charles River to shift its supply chain to Cambodia and other sources. Charles River began obtaining macaques from several suppliers, including Envigo Global Services, Inc. and Orient BioResource Center, Inc. (both later acquired by Inotiv, Inc.), as well as directly from Vanny Group subsidiaries in Cambodia and Vietnam, and other brokers. The Vanny Group was a major supplier in the region. During this period, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began investigating the international trade in macaques, suspecting that the rapid increase in Cambodian exports could not be explained by captive breeding alone and might involve illegal capture of wild macaques, which is prohibited under Cambodian and international law. In 2021 and 2022, public signs of the investigation emerged, including a guilty plea by an Orient BioResource executive and SEC filings by Inotiv disclosing grand jury subpoenas. In September 2022, a shipment of macaques from KF Cambodia to Charles River was seized by U.S. authorities. In November 2022, the DOJ unsealed an indictment alleging a conspiracy to smuggle wild-caught macaques into the U.S., naming Vanny Group executives and Cambodian officials, and referencing two unnamed U.S. companies (alleged to be Inotiv and WW Primates). Charles River subsequently made public statements and SEC disclosures about the impact of the indictment on its supply chain, with its CEO assuring investors that the indicted supplier was not a supplier of Charles River. However, further seizures of macaque shipments to Charles River occurred in late 2022 and early 2023. Analyst reports and subsequent disclosures linked Charles River's supply chain to the indicted suppliers, and Charles River's stock price declined following these events and disclosures. In February 2023, Charles River disclosed it had received a grand jury subpoena related to macaque shipments from Cambodia and suspended such shipments. In March 2023, the CEO acknowledged that Charles River had historically used suppliers that sourced animals from various origins.",

      "factual_background":"Robert Miller, age 63, died during an encounter with Barnstable police officers Sean Roycroft and Spencer Jackson at his Cape Cod home in 2019. The incident began when Miller's girlfriend, Amy Anderson, called 911 around 7:03 p.m., reporting that Miller 'need[ed] a psych evaluation' but did not report any crime. Officer Roycroft arrived at Miller's home at 7:09 p.m., and Officer Jackson arrived about a minute later. By 7:12 p.m., after a struggle to handcuff Miller on the floor of the home's office area, the officers called for an ambulance for Miller, who was unresponsive and later pronounced dead at 8:00 p.m. The sequence of events included a physical struggle in which Roycroft, with his arms around Miller's chest from behind, and Miller both fell to the floor, pinning Roycroft's left arm under Miller's body. Roycroft, weighing approximately 220 pounds, landed on top of Miller, who landed on a golf club. Roycroft's right leg was over Miller's left leg, and his right arm was between Miller's shoulder blades. Miller attempted to lift his chest, but Roycroft pushed down with his right arm to prevent this. Jackson delivered two body punches to Miller's right side in an attempt to distract him and facilitate handcuffing. After the second punch, Roycroft freed his left arm, Jackson pulled Miller's right hand behind his back and cuffed it, and Roycroft grabbed Miller's left hand. Anderson observed one officer drive a knee into Miller's back and heard Miller say, 'I can't breathe' and 'Amy, help me.' Jackson finished handcuffing Miller, and Roycroft attempted to get Miller to his feet but was unable to do so. Miller was rolled onto his side, found to be unresponsive, and CPR was initiated. The medical examiner listed the cause of death as 'cardiac dysrhythmia in the setting of excited delirium [due to] unknown psychiatric illness at the time of the restraint.' Plaintiff's medical expert opined that Miller died of 'prone restraint cardiac arrest' caused by pressure applied to his back that impaired his breathing.",

Under the terms of the insurance policy, Progressive was required to pay the actual cash value (ACV) of the totaled vehicles, defined as 'the market value, age, and condition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.' Progressive calculated the market value by comparing the insured vehicle to similar vehicles for sale or recently sold in the insureds\u2019 market area, using the WorkCenter Total-Loss system licensed from Mitchell International, Inc. (the 'Mitchell Report'). As part of this calculation, the Mitchell Report applied a 'projected sold adjustment' (PSA), which reduced the list prices of comparable vehicles to reflect consumer purchasing behavior (i.e., negotiating a different price than the listed price). The plaintiffs alleged that the PSA always resulted in a flawed, negative line-item adjustment because it did not consider reasons why a vehicle may have sold below list price (such as military or promotional discounts) and omitted vehicles sold above list price as outliers. Plaintiffs claimed this methodology skewed vehicle prices downward and breached the express terms of Progressive\u2019s uniform automobile insurance policy by preventing ACV from being determined by the true market value of the vehicle.",

According to Ward, Aprileo pushed him as he exited her home. When Ward attempted to handcuff her, Aprileo pulled away. Ward then used a 'forced arm bar' maneuver to bring Aprileo to the ground and arrested her, resulting in a fractured elbow. Aprileo was charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, and assault and battery on a police officer. She did not enter a plea to these charges. Instead, on January 29, 2020, Aprileo and the Commonwealth agreed that the charges would be dismissed after she completed three months of pretrial probation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, \u00a7 87. The probation required her to obey all laws and court orders, notify the probation department of changes in contact information, and make no false statements to court officers. The agreement was memorialized on a form titled 'TENDER OF PLEA OR ADMISSION & WAIVER OF RIGHTS,' but none of the boxes for guilty plea or admission were checked, and Aprileo did not admit to any facts.

      "factual_background":"Bar Harbor, Maine, is a small coastal town and popular tourist destination, especially during the summer and fall, with a population of about 5,500 that swells with visitors. In recent years, Bar Harbor has become a frequent port of call for large cruise ships, each carrying thousands of passengers. The influx of cruise passengers led to concerns among residents about congestion, public safety, and the impact on local amenities and quality of life. In response, Bar Harbor had previously implemented voluntary caps on daily cruise passenger disembarkations, managed through a reservation system, but these were not enforceable. In 2022, after continued resident dissatisfaction, a citizen initiative led to the adoption of a new ordinance (the 'Ordinance') that imposes a mandatory cap of 1,000 cruise ship passengers disembarking per day at any of the town's piers, with fines for violations. The Ordinance defines a cruise ship as any watercraft with 49 or more berths. The local business plaintiffs own or operate piers, tender vessels, or businesses serving cruise passengers. The Penobscot Bay and River Pilots Association provides pilotage services to cruise vessels in the area and has invested in response to increased cruise traffic. Charles Sidman, a Bar Harbor resident and proponent of the initiative, intervened as a defendant.",
      "procedural_history":{
        "claims_brought":"The plaintiffs filed suit in December 2022, alleging that the Ordinance is preempted by federal law (Supremacy Clause), violates the Commerce Clause (Dormant Commerce Clause), and violates the Due Process Clause by depriving them of property interests. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The Pilots Association intervened, bringing similar federal claims and two additional state law claims alleging the Ordinance exceeded municipal authority under Maine's Home Rule provisions and was preempted by state pilotage law and state economic development policy. Charles Sidman intervened as a defendant. The Town of Bar Harbor and Sidman answered the complaints. After denial of a motion to dismiss, the case proceeded to an expedited three-day bench trial in July 2023, with post-trial briefing.",
        "district_court_decision":"The district court denied the request to enjoin the Ordinance and found in favor of the defendants on all but one claim. The court found that the Ordinance was preempted by federal maritime security regulations only to the extent it prevented cruise ship crew members (seafarers) from coming ashore, but declined to enjoin the Ordinance based on the town's assurance it would address this conflict.",
        "what_is_appealed":"The plaintiffs and the Pilots appealed the district court's rejection of their federal and state preemption, Dormant Commerce Clause, and Due Process claims. Sidman cross-appealed the court's finding of preemption regarding seafarer access."

In March 2010, she was placed in immigration removal proceedings and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). In April 2010, an Indian court issued a warrant for Kapoor's arrest based on five violations of the Indian Penal Code (IPC): cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property (IPC \u00a7 420), forgery of valuable security (IPC \u00a7 467), forgery for the purpose of cheating (IPC \u00a7 468), using as genuine a forged document (IPC \u00a7 471), and criminal conspiracy (IPC \u00a7 120B). The charges stem from allegations that Kapoor and her brothers forged documents for jewelry transactions and used them to obtain licenses from the Indian government to import raw materials duty free, allegedly causing the Indian government to lose approximately $679,000.

The Department reaffirmed its decision to extradite Kapoor. Kapoor then filed a third habeas petition (the subject of this appeal), again challenging the Secretary's CAT determination and raising due process arguments. During the pendency of this petition, two charges were dismissed in India, and Kapoor argued the remaining charges were not extraditable.

As punishment, Walker was placed in Disciplinary Segregation (solitary confinement) for approximately fourteen years.

Walker was transferred to Upstate Correctional Facility, where he remained in solitary confinement under Ad Seg status. During his time in Ad Seg (2014\u20132019), Walker incurred only one misbehavior report (for cursing at a correctional officer) and otherwise maintained a positive disciplinary record. He repeatedly requested guidance on how to demonstrate he could safely return to the general population.
