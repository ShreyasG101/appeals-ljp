Nat'l Grid, PLC, 93 F. Supp. 3d 120, 139 (E.D.N.Y. 2015); Harvin v. Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit. Operating Auth., 2018 WL 1603872, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2018)). Tudor's own admissions, which are undisputed, establish that she could perform her job without the requested accommodation.

However, Second Circuit precedent is clear that the ability to perform essential functions, even under hardship, is sufficient to defeat a failure-to-accommodate claim.

The strongest counterargument is that Carlson remains good law for Eighth Amendment medical claims and that the ARP existed at the time of Carlson, so its existence should not be a 'special factor' in this context. However, Egbert's language is broad, and most circuits have read it to foreclose Bivens claims where the ARP exists, even in Carlson-type cases.

The VSP, not the VHRC, controlled plaintiff's employment. The fact that the VHRC could provide a name-clearing hearing or informal process under Vermont law does not suffice under Velez unless the VHRC had some control over the employment consequences. The strongest argument for reversal is that the VHRC's findings and publication foreseeably caused the employment consequences, but Velez and its progeny require more direct authority or control. Thus, the district court's dismissal was correct.",

The categorical approach (Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990)) requires courts to look only to the statutory elements, not the facts of the conviction.

The key is whether 'using an object capable of causing grave bodily injury' necessarily involves 'violent force.' The First Circuit in Taylor and Whindleton has held that statutes requiring use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of a robbery or assault do satisfy the 'violent force' requirement. The plain language of Article 173-B requires actual use of a dangerous weapon, not mere possession or presence. There is no evidence that the statute is overbroad in a way that would allow conviction without violent force (e.g., by mere constructive possession or unawareness by the victim). Therefore, under binding First Circuit precedent, the district court correctly concluded that the statute qualifies as a 'violent felony' under the ACCA.",

Sanchez Valle was decided June 9, 2016. The petition was filed September 20, 2016, within one year. Thus, the claim was timely if Sanchez Valle applies retroactively. However, the First Circuit has not held that Sanchez Valle is retroactively applicable on collateral review, and most courts have not treated it as such. On the merits, Sanchez Valle held that Puerto Rico and the federal government are not separate sovereigns for Double Jeopardy purposes, so a person cannot be prosecuted by both for the same offense. If petitioner was prosecuted for the same conduct by both, he may have a claim. The district court erred in using 'privity' as the test, but the claim fails if Sanchez Valle is not retroactive or if the prosecutions were not for the same offense. The record does not show that the petitioner was prosecuted for the same conduct by both sovereigns. Thus, even if the claim is timely, it fails on the merits."

Only the second prong is disputed here. The Pickering test requires balancing the employee's and public's interest in the speech against the government's interest in the efficient provision of public services.

      "step5_analysis":{
        "issue_1":"Applying de novo review, the Pickering balance must be struck independently. Hussey's post was made as a private citizen, on a matter of public concern (police reform, the naming of legislation, and the legacy of George Floyd). The manner of speech was disparaging but not obscene or racially charged. The post was made on a private Facebook account, visible to hundreds (including many police officers), and deleted after a few hours, but was screenshotted and shared with community leaders. The department received complaints from the NAACP and local activists, who met with the Commissioner and expressed alarm. There is no evidence of widespread public controversy, media coverage, or internal disruption among officers (indeed, Hussey received support from some colleagues). The department's stated concern was harm to public trust, especially in the context of national scrutiny of policing. The First Circuit and other circuits give substantial deference to law enforcement's predictions of disruption, especially regarding public trust, but require some evidence beyond speculation. Here, the evidence is limited to a small number of community complaints (from respected leaders), the Commissioner's own assessment, and the national climate. There is no evidence of actual disruption, but the law does not require it. The question is whether, as a matter of law, this evidence is sufficient to outweigh Hussey's interest, or whether a reasonable jury could find that the department's interest was not sufficiently strong or that the risk of disruption was speculative. On balance, the evidence of likely disruption is not overwhelming, but it is not purely speculative: the complaints came from influential community members, and the context was highly charged. The First Circuit has affirmed summary judgment for employers in similar circumstances (see Curran, Locurto, Grutzmacher). The district court's conclusion is supported by the record and controlling law. While the evidence is not overwhelming, it is sufficient to justify summary judgment under the First Circuit's deferential approach to law enforcement predictions of disruption."

The only complaints came from three community leaders (albeit influential), there was no media coverage, no evidence of actual loss of public trust, and Hussey's post was not widely disseminated. A reasonable jury could find that the department's prediction of disruption was speculative, especially given the lack of internal disruption and the fact that other officers received lesser or no discipline for similar or worse conduct. The Ninth Circuit in Moser and the Third Circuit in Fenico have reversed summary judgment in similar cases, requiring more concrete evidence of likely disruption. The First Circuit, however, has not adopted such a stringent requirement, and gives more deference to law enforcement. Still, this is a close case, and reasonable judges could disagree."

The district court\u2019s prediction that the Connecticut Supreme Court would reject Belgada is not without basis, but Belgada is the most recent and directly on-point state appellate authority, and the Second Circuit has held that federal courts should follow state intermediate appellate decisions unless there is 'persuasive evidence' the state\u2019s highest court would decide otherwise. Belgada post-dates Integrity Staffing (though it does not cite it), and explicitly adopts the 'predominant benefit' test for Connecticut law. The district court\u2019s rationale for disregarding Belgada is that it did not consider Integrity Staffing, but this is not enough to disregard a binding state appellate decision, especially where the Connecticut Supreme Court has not spoken. The plain language of \u00a7 31-76b(2)(A) is also broader than the PTPA, and the Connecticut legislature did not expressly adopt the PTPA. Other states with similar statutes have declined to engraft the PTPA absent clear legislative intent. Thus, the correct answer is that, under current Connecticut law, the 'predominant benefit' test applies, and the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on Integrity Staffing. There is at least a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the security screening time was for the predominant benefit of the employer and thus compensable under Connecticut law.",

The First Circuit previously affirmed the denial of derivative sovereign immunity but did not reach other issues. The current appeal is from the denial of the motion to compel arbitration.",

Under First Circuit precedent, this constitutes substantial invocation of the litigation machinery and supports waiver, especially given the delay and prejudice to plaintiffs. Second, third-party beneficiary: The contract's arbitration clause is limited to disputes 'between the parties' (i.e., the au pair and International Care, Ltd.), with no clear or definite intent to benefit Cultural Care, Inc. The First Circuit in Hogan v. SPAR Grp., Inc. requires unambiguous language, which is absent here. Third, equitable estoppel: Plaintiffs' claims are statutory and do not depend on the contract; the contract is not the source of the alleged wage violations. Thus, Cultural Care, Inc. cannot compel arbitration under either theory."

The FMIA contains an express preemption clause: 'Requirements within the scope of this chapter with respect to premises, facilities and operations of any establishment at which inspection is provided under this chapter which are in addition to, or different than those made under this chapter may not be imposed by any State.' (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 678). The Supreme Court in National Meat Ass'n v. Harris, 565 U.S. 452 (2012), held that state laws imposing additional or different requirements on slaughterhouse operations are preempted, but state laws regulating upstream activities (e.g., farming) or downstream sales are not preempted unless they function as a de facto regulation of slaughterhouse operations.",

The Act does not dictate how slaughterhouses must operate, nor does it require them to adopt any particular procedures beyond what is already required for other specialty products. The Supreme Court in Harris drew a clear line between state laws that directly regulate slaughterhouse operations (preempted) and those that regulate upstream or downstream activities (not preempted). The Act falls on the non-preempted side of that line. The recordkeeping and segregation practices cited by the plaintiffs are not compelled by the Act, but are business choices to facilitate compliance. There is no impossibility of compliance with both state and federal law, nor does the Act stand as an obstacle to the FMIA's purposes, which are focused on food safety and uniform inspection standards, not animal welfare. The Act's purpose and effect are distinct from the FMIA's. Therefore, the Act is not preempted.",

Plaintiffs' theory is that the use of the PSA systematically underpaid class members. However, because Progressive was not required to use the Mitchell method, and because other valuation methods could yield equal or lower ACVs, determining whether any class member was underpaid would require individualized, vehicle-specific inquiries. This is not a case where a single, uniform practice necessarily resulted in underpayment to all class members. The need to determine the correct ACV for each vehicle, considering all relevant factors and alternative methodologies, means that individualized issues would predominate. This is consistent with Ninth Circuit precedent (e.g., Lara v. First Nat'l Ins. Co. of Am., 25 F.4th 1134 (9th Cir. 2022)), which holds that where liability and damages require individualized proof, predominance is not met. The district court did not abuse its discretion."
