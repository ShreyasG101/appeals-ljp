JOHN P. CRONAN, United States District Judge:                             
In an Opinion and Order dated February 6, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff William 
Scales’s Second Amended Complaint, granted him leave to amend that complaint by March 8, 
2023, and informed Scales that if he failed to amend by that deadline, the case would be dismissed.  
Dkt. 76.  On February 7, 2023, Scales filed a letter with the Court regarding his case, expressing 
his desire to increase his claimed damages, discussing the conduct of Defendant’s counsel, and 
taking issue with Defendant’s efforts to resolve this litigation.  Dkt. 77.  The Court determined that 
this letter was not an amended complaint, dismissed this case with prejudice, and directed the Clerk 
of Court to enter judgment.  Dkt. 79.                                     
On April 5, 2023, Scales filed a letter stating that his February 7, 2023 letter was “actually 
[his] amended complaint,” Dkt. 81, and attached an altered version of that letter which included 
“Amended Complaint” as a heading, Dkt. 81-1.  The Court allowed Scales until April 18, 2023 to 
explain how his February 7, 2023 letter could be considered an amended complaint and how that 
document remedied the pleading deficiencies identified by the Court in its February 6, 2023 
Opinion and Order.  Dkt. 83.  That Opinion and Order dismissed Scales’s Second Amended 
Complaint for failure to state a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation by Defendant, 
because Scales failed to allege actions that were “arbitrary, discriminatory, or taken in bad faith,” 
as opposed to merely negligent.  Scales v. N.Y. Hotel & Motel Trades Council, Local 6, No. 21 
Civ. 8142 (JPC), 2023 WL 1779617, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, 2023). 
 Scales then filed a letter on April 18, 2023 stating that his February 7, 2023 letter should 
be treated as an amended complaint “because it illustrates an estimate of damages that has been 
caused since the start of this trial including a delay in the process of the arbitration motion.”  Dkt. 
84.  Scales did not address how his February 7, 2023 letter addressed the pleading deficiencies 
previously  identified  by  the  Court,  and  indeed  repeatedly  refers  to  Defendant’s  conduct  as 
“neglect” in his April 18, 2023 filing.  Jd. 
 Ultimately, Scales has not changed the Court’s determination that the February 7, 2023 
letter was not an amended complaint and that this case was therefore properly terminated on April 
3, 2023 after Scales failed to file an amended complaint.  But even if the Court were to consider 
the February 7, 2023 letter as an amended complaint, Scales has presented no argument as to how 
it remedies the pleading deficiencies in the Second Amended Complaint.  Nor does the Court, 
upon its  own review of the  document,  determine that it remedies  Scales’s previous pleading 
deficiencies.  The February 7, 2023 letter does not address Defendant’s conduct underlying this 
litigation  and  discussed  in the  Second Amended  Complaint,  Dkt.  53,  and  instead primarily 
discusses Defendant’s and Defendant’s counsel’s conduct throughout this case and a concurrent 
arbitration.  Dkt. 77.  The Court therefore does not see how Scales’s letter could be said to amend 
the Second Amended Complaint, let alone remedy the pleading deficiencies in that complaint. 
 SO ORDERED.

JOHN P. CRONAN, United States District Judge:                             
In an Opinion and Order dated February 6, 2023, the Court dismissed Plaintiff William 
Scales’s Second Amended Complaint, granted leave to amend by March 8, 2023, and informed 
Scales that if he failed to amend by that deadline, the case would be dismissed.  Dkt. 76.  On 
February 7, 2023, Scales filed a letter with the Court regarding his case, expressing his desire to 
increase his claimed damages, discussing the conduct of Defendant’s counsel, and taking issue 
with Defendant’s efforts to resolve this litigation.  Dkt. 77.  This letter was clearly not an amended 
complaint, even construed liberally on the basis of Scales’s pro se status, and so on April 3, 2023 
the Court dismissed this case with prejudice and directed the Clerk of Court to enter judgment.  
Dkt. 79.                                                                  
On April 5, 2023, Scales filed two new letters with the Court.  The first stated that his 
February 7, 2023 letter was “actually [his] amended complaint,” Dkt. 81, and attached an altered 
version of that letter which included “Amended Complaint” as a heading, Dkt. 81-1.  The second 
letter informed the Court that “a lawsuit has been filed against The United States District Court 
Southern District of New York,” stated that Scales “did make the March deadline to submit an 
amended complaint,” and requested “additional time to amend [the] complaint again in order to 
briefly describe the specific reasons for the case.”  Dkt. 82. 
 Scales has not altered the Court’s determination that the February 7, 2023 letter was not an 
amended complaint when filed, but mindful of Scales’s pro se status and the fact that the Second 
Circuit has stated that even frivolous complaints should not be dismissed sua sponte without notice 
and an opportunity to be heard, see Nwoye v. Obama, No. 22-1253, 2023 WL 382950, at *1-2 (2d 
Cir. Jan. 25, 2023), the Court will allow Scales to file a letter by April 18, 2023 explaining why 
the February 7, 2023  letter should be considered an amended complaint, given that as Scales 
appears to acknowledge it did not “briefly describe the specific reasons for the case,” and how that 
document remedied the pleading deficiencies previously identified by the Court in the February 6, 
2023 Opinion and Order. 
 SO ORDERED.

JOHN P. CRONAN, United States District Judge:                             

Pro se Plaintiff William Scales brings a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation 
against his union, the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council Local 6 (“Local 6”),1 related to 
the placement of his 401(k) contributions into Local 6’s plan.  Local 6 has moved to dismiss, 
arguing that Scales’s claim is barred by the statute of limitations and, alternatively, that Scales has 
failed to state a claim.  See Dkts. 59-61.  Although the Court cannot on the current record resolve 
whether Scales’s claim is timely, Scales has failed to allege that Local 6’s conduct was arbitrary, 
discriminatory, or in bad faith, as required to plausibly plead a breach of the duty of fair 
representation.  The Court therefore grants Local 6’s motion and dismisses the Second Amended 
Complaint.  The dismissal is without prejudice to Scales filing a Third Amended Complaint in the 
event he is able to cure the pleading defects discussed herein.           


1 Scales refers to Defendant interchangeably by a number of names including “HTC,” 
“Local 6,” and “Local 6 401K/pension department.”  Dkt. 53 (“Second Am. Compl.”) at 4, Exh. 1 
at 1-2.  For the sake of clarity, the Court refers to Defendant solely as “Local 6.”  
                      I.  Background                                 
A.     Factual Background2                                                
Scales is a former and possibly current employee of the Ace Hotel New York (the “Ace 
Hotel”).  Second Am. Compl., Exh. 1 at 1; accord Dkt. 70 at 2.  In 2012, Scales was laid off from 

his employment with the Ace Hotel.  Second Am. Compl., Exh. 1 at 1.  At around the same time, 
Local 6 took over as the new union to represent Ace Hotel employees.  Id.  Employees at the Ace 
Hotel were then given thirty days to select either the Ace Hotel’s or Local 6’s 401(k) pension plan.  
Id.  This thirty-day period apparently occurred while Scales was laid off, and Scales was not 
informed of the opportunity to select one of the two plans.  Id.          
At some point Scales returned to work at the Ace Hotel, and the hotel “gave [him] a form 
to choose a retirement plan and [he] picked the employer plan.”  Id.  He was then “told [he] would 
be on the hotel 401(k) plan.”  Id.  In 2018, he contacted Local 6’s “401k/pension department” after 
he learned from the Ace Hotel that Local 6 “was the current receiver of [his] 401k contributions.”  
Id.  Local 6 told Scales that his 401(k) had “defaulted into the union’s pension plan and this had 

occurred when [he] was laid off.”  Id.  Scales subsequently filed a complaint with Local 6 and 
waited “weeks upon weeks” before Local 6 informed him it could not assist him.  Id. at 2.  Local 
6 advised Scales that he would need to “retrieve the money from Ace Hotel.”  Id.  Scales then 
requested that Local 6 “provide [him with] a free attorney from the benefit department in order to 
retrieve the funds.”  Id.  Local 6 again informed Scales that it would not be able to assist him 
because “the 401k contract was created before [L]ocal 6 . . . was the active union and voted into 

2 The following facts, which are assumed true for purposes of this Opinion and Order, are 
taken from the Second Amended Complaint.  See Interpharm, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank, Nat’l 
Ass’n, 655 F.3d 136, 141 (2d Cir. 2011) (explaining that on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 
12(b)(6), the court must “assum[e] all facts alleged within the four corners of the complaint to be 
true, and draw[] all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs’ favor”).        
the building.”  Id.   Additionally, according to Scales, Local 6’s “lack of record keeping resulted 
into a debate over the amounts of the contributions that were missing.”  Second Am. Compl. at 6.   
Scales then contacted the Ace Hotel, which informed him that Local 6 was receiving his 
401(k) contributions and was “withholding [his] contributions,” and for that reason, “[A]ce [H]otel 

corporate would not assist further.”  Id., Exh. 1 at 2.  But then human resources at the Ace Hotel 
“attempted to contact [Local 6’s] pension department on [Scales’s] behalf and request and ushered 
an agreement that going forward [Scales] would receive all contributions into a [Local 6] provided 
401k.”  Id.  Scales, however, “didn’t accept this offer.”  Id.            
Scales proceeded to engage in “mediation attempts” which spanned for “at least an entire 
year.”  Id.  During these attempts at mediation, the “only effort in resolving [Scales’s] issue [came] 
from [Scales] and [A]ce [H]otel hr.”  Id.  Local 6 “never investigated any contracts or held an 
arbitration motion on [Scales’s] behalf.”  Id.  Local 6 did email Ace Hotel to confirm that Scales 
had a 401(k) plan, but otherwise “never investigated or retrieved any contracts, attempted any 
mediation attempts, or arbitration motions on [Scales’s] direct behalf to address” his situation.  Id.  

Because Scales’s 401(k) funds are held by Local 6, his “pension is fixed and [he] cannot withdraw 
money from it.”  Id. at 2-3.                                              
Scales claims that his 401(k) “is worth $400,000 plus interest and is currently misplaced 
and attempted to be lowered.”  Second Am. Compl. at 6.  He further states that he has “missed 
opportunities,” which has caused him to lose “financial opportunities and living arrangements,” 
because his 401(k) “is intended to produce activity for 2 corporations, and 40 sole proprietor 
businesses.”  Id.  As relief, he seeks “$1,400,000 plus all interest that would have accumulated” 
with the Ace Hotel’s 401(k) plan.  Id.                                    
B.  Procedural Background                                                 
Scales initiated this action on August 25, 2021 in New York County Supreme Court.  Dkt. 
4 (“Notice of Removal”) ¶ 5.  Local 6 removed the case to this District in early October 2021.  Id.  
Following the onset of an arbitration related to Scales’s underlying claims, the Court stayed this 

case until January 3, 2022.  Dkt. 12 at 4.  On January 4, 2022, the Court set a briefing schedule for 
Local 6’s motion to dismiss and stayed discovery pending resolution of that motion.  Dkt. 16.   
Local 6 filed its motion to dismiss the original Complaint on February 15, 2022.  Dkts. 37-
39.  On March 25, 2022, Scales sought an extension of time to respond to that motion and further 
requested leave to file an amended complaint.  Dkt. 46.  After the Court granted leave, Dkt. 50, 
Scales filed the First Amended Complaint on April 11, 2022.  Dkt. 51.  Without leave of Court, 
however, Scales then filed the Second Amended Complaint on April 18, 2022.  Dkt. 53.  The Court 
subsequently granted nunc pro tunc leave to file that pleading on April 20, 2022 with Local 6’s 
consent.  Dkt. 56.                                                        
Local 6 filed its pending motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint, along with 

supporting documents, on May 2, 2022.  Dkts. 59-61.  Scales filed an opposition to that motion on 
May 27, 2022.  Dkt. 70.  Local 6 filed its reply on June 10, 2022.  Dkt. 71. 
                   II.  Standard of Review                           
A.   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)                             
To survive a motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, 
accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 
U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is 
plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable 
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  A complaint’s “[f]actual 
allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 
U.S. at 555.  Although the Court must “accept[] as true the factual allegations in the complaint and 
draw[] all inferences in the plaintiff’s favor,” Biro v. Condé Nast, 807 F.3d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 2015), 
it need not “accept as true legal conclusions couched as factual allegations,” LaFaro v. N.Y. 

Cardiothoracic Grp., 570 F.3d 471, 475-76 (2d Cir. 2009).                 
The Court must construe pro se submissions “liberally” and interpret them “to raise the 
strongest arguments that they suggest.”  Meadows v. United Servs., Inc., 963 F.3d 240, 243 (2d 
Cir. 2020) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But a pro se complaint still “must state 
a  plausible  claim  for  relief.”    Id.  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).    “Even  in  a  pro  se 
case . . . threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory 
statements, do not suffice.”  Chavis v. Chappius, 618 F.3d 162, 170 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal 
quotation marks omitted).                                                 
B.   Statute of Limitations                                               
“The lapse of a limitations period is an affirmative defense that a defendant must plead and 

prove” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c)(1).  Staehr v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Grp., 547 
F.3d 406, 425 (2d Cir. 2008).  “Although the statute of limitations is ordinarily an affirmative 
defense that must be raised in the answer, a statute of limitations defense may be decided on a Rule 
12(b)(6) motion if the defense appears on the face of the complaint.”  Thea v. Kleinhandler, 807 
F.3d 492, 501 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).  However, because on a motion 
to dismiss a court must accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw all 
reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, Biro, 807 F.3d at 544, dismissal on statute of 
limitations grounds at the motion to dismiss stage is not appropriate “unless it appears beyond 
doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to 
relief.”  Clement v. United Homes, LLC, 914 F. Supp. 2d 362, 369 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting Ortiz v. Cornetta, 867 F.2d 146, 148 (2d Cir. 1989)).  In other 
words, “the Court can only grant a motion to dismiss based on statute of limitations grounds if 
there is no factual question as to whether the alleged violations occurred within the statutory 

period.”  Id.                                                             
                      III.  Discussion                               
A.   The Nature of Scales’s Claim                                         
The Second Amended Complaint is not entirely clear as to the nature of Scales’s claims or 
the legal authority upon which he relies.  However, section 301 of the Labor Management 
Relations Act (“LMRA”) provides for “[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and 
a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this 
chapter . . . .”  29 U.S.C. § 185(a).  This case was removed from state court on the basis of section 
301, Notice of Removal ¶¶ 18-20, because section 301 is accorded an “unusual pre-emptive 
power” that creates federal jurisdiction even when a complaint “makes no reference to federal law 

and appears to plead an adequate state claim,” Vera v. Saks & Co., 335 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir. 
2003) (quoting Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U.S. 107, 122 n.16 (1994)).  Section 301 also preempts 
state law claims when those claims are “substantially dependent” on the terms of agreement in a 
labor contract.  Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 220 (1985).  When a claim involves 
the alleged breach of such a labor agreement, the claim is “substantially dependent” on the 
agreement’s terms.  See Nelson v. Working Class, Inc., No. 99 Civ. 8854 (HB), 2000 WL 420554, 
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2000).                                           
Scales alleges that Local 6 “caused a breach of contract” by failing to correctly allocate his 
401(k) contributions.  Second Am. Compl. at 5.  While Scales has failed to provide the Court with 
the relevant contract, Local 6 has submitted a Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”), which Local 
6 maintains is an October 26, 2012 agreement “between the Union and Ace Hotel setting forth the 
initial terms and conditions of employment for Ace Hotel employees represented by the Union.”  
Dkt. 60 ¶ 4; see Dkt. 60-1 (“MOA”).  Exhibit C of the MOA is a “List of Employees to be 

Severance” and includes the name “William Scale.”  MOA, Exh. C; see MOA ¶ 17 (“The 
employees identified in Exhibit C shall each be offered the option of (i) layoff with a right to recall 
or (ii) severance . . . , in exchange for a waiver of recall and rehire rights and execution of a general 
release in favor of the Hotel.”).  Further, the agreement states that “Current Employees shall be 
entitled to elect, at the employee’s sole discretion, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the 
Industry Pension Plan gives a presentation, to either participate in the Hotel’s plan or be covered 
by the Industry Pension Plan.”  MOA ¶ 10(b).  This appears to be the provision Scales refers to in 
the Second Amended Complaint when he alleges that Local 6 “caused a breach of contract by not 
contacting me when my authority was required to maintain my 401k plan.”  Second Am. Compl. 
at 5; see also id., Exh. 1 at 1 (“At [the time Local 6 became the union for Ace Hotel employees], 

there was a 30 day period for employees to pick the union’s pension or the employer’s plan.  I was 
not notified of this period.”).  Because the MOA therefore is referenced in the Second Amended 
Complaint and forms the basis of the claims in that Complaint, the Court considers it in resolving 
the motion to dismiss.  See Roth v. Jennings, 489 F.3d 499, 509 (2d Cir. 2007) (“[E]ven if not 
attached or incorporated by reference, a document upon which the complaint solely relies and 
which is integral to the complaint may be considered by the court in ruling on [a motion to 
dismiss].” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).           
Scales’s purported “breach of contract” claim is asserted against his union, Local 6, but the 
MOA was between Local 6 and Scales’s employer, the Ace Hotel, not between Scales and his 
union.  Such claims are considered “hybrid claims” which are made up of a claim under section 
301 against an employer and a claim for breach of the duty of fair representation against the union 
for failure to adequately represent the employee in remedying the breach of the collective 
bargaining agreement.  See DelCostello v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 165 (1983) 

(explaining that a claim for breach of a collective bargaining agreement is a “hybrid § 301/fair 
representation claim” with the section 301 claim brought against the employer and the fair 
representation claim against the union); see also Martinez v. SEIU Loc. 32BJ, No. 18 Civ. 3961 
(JMF), 2019 WL 1259381, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2019) (examining a hybrid claim). 
Scales’s allegations therefore present a federal claim against Local 6 for breach of the duty 
of  fair  representation.    “The  National  Labor  Relations  Act  imposes  a  federal  duty  of  fair 
representation on unions to act on behalf of their members without hostility or discrimination in 
complete good faith and honesty to avoid arbitrary conduct.”  Bryant v. Am. Fed’n of Musicians 
of the US & Canada, No. 14 Civ. 2598 (PAC) (HBP), 2015 WL 7301076, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 
18, 2015), aff’d, 666 F. App’x 14 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  

State law claims are preempted by a duty of fair representation claim if they “impose[] an 
obligation on the union already imposed by the duty of fair representation.”  Id. (quoting Walsh v. 
Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers Loc. 503, 62 F. Supp. 3d 300, 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)).  Scales’s claim 
that Local 6 has inadequately represented him in seeking the release of his 401(k) funds is thus 
properly, and only, a federal claim against Local 6 for breach of the duty of fair representation, as 
it is premised on the union’s obligation to fairly represent him in seeking redress from his employer 
under the MOA.  Id. (“Plaintiff’s state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty—premised on 
allegations of bad faith . . . and inadequately representing her interests as a union member—are 
subsumed by the duty of fair representation.”).                           
For those reasons, the Court construes the Second Amended Complaint as bringing a claim 
for breach of the federal duty of fair representation.                    
B.   Statute of Limitations                                               
Local 6 first contends that Scales’s claim is time-barred.  Dkt. 61 at 10-13.  Claims for a 

union’s breach of the duty of fair representation are subject to a six-month limitations period.  
Kalyanaram v. Am. Ass’n of Univ. Professors at N.Y. Inst. of Tech., Inc., 742 F.3d 42, 46 (2d Cir. 
2014).  “In this circuit, it is well settled that the cause of action accrues no later than the time when 
plaintiffs  knew  or  reasonably  should  have  known  that  such  a  breach  of  the  duty  of  fair 
representation had occurred, even if some possibility of nonjudicial enforcement remained.”  Id. 
(quoting Cohen v. Flushing Hosp. & Med. Ctr., 68 F.3d 64, 67 (2d Cir. 1995)).  “Further the law 
in this Circuit is well settled that a continuous or ongoing failure by the union to represent a 
plaintiff after the plaintiff knows or should know of the breach does not toll the statute of 
limitations.”  Strassberg v. N.Y. Hotel & Motel Trades Council, 31 F. App’x 15, 17 (2d Cir. 2002).   
Here, the statute of limitations began to run when Scales first learned that Local 6 would 
not assist him in retrieving his 401(k) contributions.3  See Hosokawa v. N.Y. Loc. of Screen Actors 

Guild-Am. Fed’n of Television & Radio Artists, 745 F. App’x 433, 434 (2d Cir. 2018) (“Even if 
Plaintiff entertained hopes of future representation by the Union, she knew that it had done nothing 
as of October 3, 2013 to pursue her grievance.  This knowledge was sufficient to start the statute 
of limitations running.” (alterations omitted) (quoting Cohen, 68 F.2d at 68)).  This occurred when, 
as alleged, a representative of Local 6 “informed [Scales] that [Local 6] would not be able to assist” 
him, and further “notified [Scales] that [L]ocal 6 would not be able to assist [him] with any 


3 Any claim related to the failure in 2012 to obtain Scales’s election between the two 
available 401(k) options occurred over eight years prior to the commencement of this action, and 
therefore is clearly time-barred.                                         
representation.”  Second Am. Compl., Exh. 1 at 2.  Scales further contends that Local 6 “never 
investigated any contracts or held an arbitration motion on [his] behalf over the course of mediation 
attempts” and that “[t]he only effort in resolving this issue has come from [him] or [A]ce [H]otel 
[human resources] upon [his] request.”  Id.                               

The Second Amended Complaint, however, lacks clear allegations of when Local 6 
engaged in most of these acts or otherwise conveyed that it would not assist Scales in retrieving 
his funds.  The most revealing timing allegation is that the “mediation attempts”—for which Local 
6 did not assist Scales— “spanned for at least an entire year.”  Id.  But the Second Amended 
Complaint does not state the starting point for this “entire year” of non-assistance.  Nor does the 
Second Amended Complaint allege whether any actions by Local 6 prior to mediation indicated 
that the union was not assisting Scales’s efforts to retrieve his 401(k) contributions or when any 
such actions occurred.4  Therefore, all the Court has before it is the allegation that there was “at 
least an entire year” of non-assistance.  Because the Second Amended Complaint was filed on 
April 18, 2022, this necessarily places the start of the mediation, and thus Local 6’s denial of 

assistance at least as to the mediation, at least as far back as April 2021, if not earlier.  While that 
conduct would be outside the six-month statute of limitations if the only pleading were the Second 
Amended Complaint, the original Complaint was filed in state court on or about August 25, 2021.  
Notice of Removal ¶ 5.                                                    
The Court therefore turns to whether the Second Amended Complaint “relates back” to the 
original Complaint.  Assuming the Second Amended Complaint “relates back” to the original 

4 Local 6 argues that because Scales alleges that he first contacted Local 6 “around 2018” 
Second Am. Compl., Exh. 1 at 1, the Second Amended Complaint should be read to place all of 
the Local 6’s alleged conduct in that year.  Dkt. 61 at 10.  But the Second Amended Complaint’s 
allegations are unclear as to the length of time over which the subsequent alleged communications 
between Scales and Local 6 took place.  Second Am. Compl., Exh. 1 at 1-2.   
Complaint, the action would be timely if Scales’s claim accrued on or after February 25, 2021.  
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1) provides: “An amendment to a pleading relates back to 
the date of the original pleading when: . . . (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose 
out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original 

pleading.”  This rule “governs when an amended pleading ‘relates back’ to the date of a timely 
filed original pleading and is thus itself timely even though it was filed outside an applicable statute 
of limitations.”  Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 541 (2010).  Scales’s Second 
Amended Complaint asserts a claim arising from the same conduct as his original Complaint.  The 
original Complaint alleged that Local 6 notified Scales that he “was automatically defaulted into 
the union’s pension credit earning plan,” that he “didn’t have any contributions and needed to 
contact [his] employer Ace Hotel,” and that he “attempt[ed] to resolve this matter” with Local 6 
and the Act Hotel.  Notice of Removal, Exh. A at 2.  The original Complaint therefore sets out, or 
attempts to set out, the same failure to assist theory that is the basis of the Second Amended 
Complaint.                                                                

Having determined that the Second Amended Complaint relates back to the original 
Complaint, the next question therefore is whether the original Complaint is timely.  See Bradley v. 
Nolan, No. 03 Civ. 1616 (GBD), 2007 WL 959160, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2007) (“[T]he 
relation back doctrine is inapplicable where . . . the original complaint itself is untimely.”).  As 
noted, to be timely, Scales’s claim must have accrued on or after February 25, 2021.  But as also 
noted, the timeline that Scales provides in his pleadings is muddied to say the least.  Moreover, 
Scales  is  somewhat  inconsistent  between  his  original  Complaint  and  the  Second  Amended 
Complaint as to when exactly Local 6 told him it would not assist him.  The Second Amended 
Complaint indicates that the activity—i.e., Local 6’s refusal to assist during mediation—may have 
occurred as late as April 2021.  But the original Complaint, which was filed in August 2021, alleges 
that Scales “wasn’t notified of” the fact that his employer was receiving his 401(k) payments “until 
about last year,” which seems to suggest some time in 2020.  Notice of Removal, Exh. A at 2.     
Neither the original Complaint nor the Second Amended Complaint clearly indicates that 

Scales’s claim accrued within six months prior to the commencement of this action on August 25, 
2021.  But crediting the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, and drawing all inferences 
in favor of this pro se plaintiff, it is at least plausible that his claim could have accrued as late as 
April 2021, which would have been less than six months prior to the filing of the original 
Complaint in state court.  Without question, Local 6 is correct to fault Scales’s pleadings for 
lacking specificity as to relevant dates, which makes the statute of limitations analysis particularly 
challenging at this stage.  See Dkt. 61 at 10.  And after the development of facts in discovery, it 
may become clear that Scales’s claim is in fact time-barred.  But at this stage of the litigation, with 
the general vagueness of Scales’s allegations as to when certain events occurred and the possibility 
that his claim may be timely, the Court will not dismiss Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint as 

time-barred.  See Clement, 914 F. Supp. 2d at 369 (explaining that dismissal on statute of 
limitations grounds at the motion to dismiss stage is not appropriate “unless it appears beyond 
doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to 
relief” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Ortiz, 867 F.2d at 148)).  Local 6 may assert a 
statute of limitations defense later in this case upon further development of the record and 
assuming Scales is able to amend his pleading to resolve the deficiencies identified infra.  See 
Rachunow v. Jamieson, No. 20 Civ. 5627 (PKC), 2021 WL 1894206, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 
2021) (“[T]he Court does not need to resolve the issues that arise from plaintiff’s inconsistent 
pleading of dates.  Defendant is not foreclosed from asserting a statute-of-limitations defense at 
trial.”).                                                                 
C.    Breach of the Duty of Fair Representation                           
To plead a hybrid section 301/duty of fair representation claim, a plaintiff must allege “(1) 
that the employer breached a collective bargaining agreement and (2) that the union breached its 

duty of fair representation vis-à-vis the union members.”  Martinez, 2019 WL 1259381, at *3 
(quoting White v. White Rose Food, 237 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir. 2001)).  The duty of fair 
representation  requires  a  union  “to  serve  the  interests  of  all  members  without  hostility  or 
discrimination . . . , to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid 
arbitrary conduct.”  Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 177 (1967).  “A union breaches its duty of fair 
representation if its actions with respect to a member are arbitrary, discriminatory, or taken in bad 
faith,” Fowlkes v. Ironworkers Loc. 40, 790 F.3d 378, 388 (2d Cir. 2015), and those actions have 
a “causal connection” to a union member’s injuries, White, 237 F.3d at 178 (quoting Spellacy v. 
Airline Pilots Ass’n-Int’l, 156 F.3d 120, 126 (2d Cir. 1988)).  See Jenkins v. Collins Bldg. Services, 
Inc., No. 10 Civ. 6305 (AKH), 2013 WL 8112381, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 17, 2013) (“A plaintiff . . . 

who claims that a union breached its duty of fair representation by failing to pursue a grievance 
must allege some facts suggesting that the union’s conduct was arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad 
faith.”).   “This high standard reflects that judicial review of union action ‘must be highly 
deferential, recognizing the wide latitude that unions need for the effective performance of their 
bargaining responsibilities.’”  Fleischer v. Barnard Coll., No. 19 Civ. 10738 (RA), 2020 WL 
7360251, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2020) (quoting Spellacy, 156 F.3d at 126 (2d Cir. 1998)), aff’d, 
2021 WL 5365581 (2d Cir. Nov. 18, 2021).                                  
Union action is “arbitrary only if, in light of the factual and legal landscape at the time of 
the union’s actions, the union’s behavior is so far outside a wide range of reasonableness as to be 
irrational.”  Air Line Pilots Ass’n-Int’l v. O’Neill, 499 U.S. 65, 67 (1991) (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted); see Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild, Inc., 525 U.S. 33, 46 (1998) (“A union’s 
conduct can be classified as arbitrary only when it is irrational, when it is without a rational basis 
or  explanation.”).    “This  ‘wide  range  or  reasonableness’  gives  the  union  room  to  make 

discretionary decisions and choices, even if those judgments are ultimately wrong.”  Marquez, 525 
U.S. at 45-46.  A union’s action is discriminatory “when substantial evidence indicates that it 
engaged  in  discrimination  that  was  intentional,  severe,  and  unrelated  to  legitimate  union 
objectives.”  Vaughn v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, Int’l, 604 F.3d 703, 709 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  And “[a] union acts in bad faith when it acts with an improper intent, 
purpose, or motive.”  Spellacy, 156 F.3d at 126.  “A showing of bad faith requires a showing of 
fraudulent, deceitful, or dishonest action.”  Fleischer, 2020 WL 7360251, at *5 (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted).  “Decisions of a tactical nature, errors of judgment, or negligent 
actions do not amount to bad faith.”  Id.; see also Barr v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 868 F.2d 36, 
43-44 (2d Cir. 1989).                                                     

Scales has failed to allege arbitrary, discriminatory, or bad faith conduct.  The Second 
Amended Complaint contends that when Scales contacted Local 6’s “401k department,” the 
department “forwarded” him to another agent of Local 6.  Second Am. Compl., Exh. 1 at 1.  That 
agent then invited Scales to “come in and fill out a complaint form.”  Id. at 2.  Weeks later, Local 
6 informed Scales that it could not assist him.  Id.  Local 6 further told Scales it could not provide 
him with legal representation “[a]fter consideration” because the “401k contract was created 
before [L]ocal 6 . . . was the active union and voted into the building.”  Id.  But even after Local 6 
informed Scales it would not assist him, the Ace Hotel and Local 6 apparently presented Scales 
with “an agreement that going forward [he] would receive all [401(k)] contributions into a [Local 
6] provided 401k.”  Id.5  Scales did not accept this agreement.  Id.      
In this context, a union acts arbitrarily “in failing to initiate or process a grievance when it 
‘ignores or perfunctorily presses a meritorious claim.’”  Thomas v. Little Flower for Rehab. & 
Nursing, 793 F. Supp. 2d 544, 548 (E.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting Samuels v. Air Transp. Loc. 504, 992 

F.2d 12, 16 (2d Cir. 1993)).  But a union does not act arbitrarily when it “fails to process a meritless 
grievance, engages in mere negligent conduct, or fails to process a grievance due to error in 
evaluating the merits of the grievance.”  Cruz v. Loc. Union No. 3 of the Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 
34 F. 3d 1148, 1153-54 (2d Cir. 1994); accord Messina v. 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers 
E., 453 F. App’x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2011) (“A union’s [duty of fair representation] is not breached 
where the union fails to process a meritless grievance, fails to process a grievance due to error in 
evaluating its merits, . . . engages in mere negligent conduct or errors in judgment, . . . or decides 
not to arbitrate a grievance.” (internal citations omitted)).             
Here, as alleged, Local 6 provided Scales a reason for its inability to further investigate or 
pursue his grievance related to his 401k payments:  it believed that it could not do so “because the 

401k contract was created before [Local 6] was the active union,” a conclusion reached “[a]fter 
consideration.”  Second Am. Compl., Exh. 1 at 2.6  Local 6’s determination that it could not pursue 

5 The Second Amended Complaint is unclear as to Local 6’s role in creating this agreement.    
6 Scales’s opposition to dismissal lays out further efforts undertaken by Local 6 on his 
behalf.  Since the start of this litigation, Local 6 “made an arbitration attempt” with Scales’s 
employer which was unsuccessful.  Dkt. 70 at 2.  Local 6 engaged in “investigative effort . . . after 
they lost the arbitration proceeding.”  Id. at 3.  Apparently at some point during that arbitration 
proceeding, “the arbitration process was adjourned” and “that allowed [Local 6’s counsel] to 
further investigate” though counsel “was unprepared” for the “[second] portion of the arbitration 
proceeding.”  Id.  Following that proceeding, counsel “has attempted a very small investigative 
effort in hopes of appealing the arbitration decision.”  Id.  These contentions would further 
undermine any violation of the duty of fair representation, as they reflect Local 6 undertaking even 
more efforts in pursuit of Scales’s grievance.  See Sales v. Clark, No. 14 Civ. 8091 (PAC) (MHD), 
2015 WL 7731441, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16, 2015) (concluding that the plaintiff failed to allege 
arbitrary union action, in the context of a Title VII claim, where the union’s counsel at an 
an attempt to transfer Scales’s 401(k) out of the union plan, correct or not, does not rise to the level 
of arbitrariness as it reflects a reasonable interpretation of the MOA prohibiting such a transfer.7  
See MOA ¶ 10(a) (“No Current Employee who participates in the Industry Plan may switch to the 
Hotel’s plan.”); see also Tavarez v. 32BJ, No. 18 Civ. 8517 (CM), 2019 WL 5683370, at *2 

(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 1, 2019) (“Th[e] wide range of reasonableness gives the union room to make

(dismissing a breach of the duty of fair representation claim where the plaintiff alleged no facts 
making it plausible that the union was not simply “exercising its prerogative to not advance a 
grievance it may well have deemed unlikely to succeed”); Cappelli v. Jack Resnick & Sons, Inc., 
No. 13 Civ. 4381 (GHW), 2014 WL 4188084, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2014) (dismissing a claim 
for a breach of the duty of fair representation where the union determined after investigation that 
the plaintiff’s claims lacked merit); cf. Martinez, 2019 WL 1259381, at *4 (holding that the

arbitration proceeding was unprepared and performed poorly because such allegations pled only 
negligence), report and recommendation adopted by 2015 WL 7736548 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 30, 2015).   
“A district court deciding a motion to dismiss may consider factual allegations made by a 
pro se party in his papers opposing the motion.”  Walker v. Schult, 717 F.3d 119, 122 n.1 (2d Cir. 
2013).  However, since this rule is based in “policy reasons favoring liberal construction of pro se 
complaints,” Rodriguez v. McGinnis, 1 F. Supp. 2d 244, 246-47 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), the Court 
analyzes Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint on its face in deciding Local 6’s motion to 
dismiss.                                                                  
7 Scales himself refers to this conduct as negligence.  Second Am. Compl. at 5 (alleging 
that Local 6 “also committed multiple accounts of neglect from 2012-2021”).  But as noted, a 
union does not act arbitrarily when it “engages in mere negligent conduct” in handling a grievance.  
Cruz, 34 F. 3d at 1154; see Jourdain v. Serv. Emps. Intern. Union Loc. 1199, No. 09 Civ. 1942 
(AKH), 2010 WL 3069965, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2010) (noting that the plaintiff’s amended 
complaint referred to the failure to pursue a grievance as negligent in granting summary judgment 
to the union).                                                            
(1) a failure to investigate his grievance at all, (2) that the union misled him into believing it was 
proceeding with his grievance while not actually doing so, (3) that the union failed to appraise him 
of a grievance hearing, or (4) that the union grossly misunderstood the evidence underlying his 
grievance).                                                               

Nor are there any allegations in the Second Amended Complaint giving rise to an inference 
that Local 6 acted in a discriminatory or bad faith manner.  For instance, Scales does not allege 
that he was the victim of unlawful or invidious discrimination.  Nor does he allege any conduct by 
the Local 6 that would suggest the union was behaving in bad faith in its treatment of his 401(k) 
contributions.                                                            
Therefore, because Scales has failed to allege that Local 6’s actions were arbitrary, 
discriminatory, or taken in bad faith, he has not plausibly alleged a breach of the duty of fair 
representation.  The Court therefore grants Local 6’s motion to dismiss the Second Amended 
Complaint.  Because the Court dismisses on these grounds, it does not reach the other requirements 
for finding liability for a breach of the duty of fair representation, i.e., whether the Second 

Amended Complaint alleges a breach of the relevant collective bargaining agreement and whether 
Local 6’s conduct caused Scales’s injuries.  See Martinez, 2019 WL 1259381, at *4 n.5 (declining 
to reach the question of whether the plaintiff adequately pleaded that his employer breached a 
collective bargaining agreement where he failed to plead that the union breached its duty).   
D.    Leave to Amend                                                      
Lastly, the Court considers whether to grant leave to amend.  Under Rule 15(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court “should freely give leave when justice so requires.”  Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  Scales has not asked the Court for leave to amend his Second Amended 
Complaint.  “But even when a party does not ask for leave to amend, the Court may grant leave to 
amend sua sponte.”  In re Garrett Motion Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 20 Civ. 7992 (JPC), 2022 WL 
976269,  at  *18  (S.D.N.Y.  Mar.  31,  2022)  (citation  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted) 
(collecting cases).  When deciding whether to sua sponte grant leave to amend, “courts will 
consider many factors, including undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive, repeated failure to cure 

deficiencies, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility.”  Morales v. Kimberly-Clark 
Corp., No. 18 Civ. 7401 (NSR), 2020 WL 2766050, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. May 27, 2020).  After 
considering these factors, the Court will grant Scales leave to file a Third Amended Complaint, in 
the event he believes he can plead facts that would adequately state a claim upon which relief may 
be granted.  While the operative complaint is Scales’s Second Amended Complaint, that complaint 
is essentially just a properly filed version of the First Amended Complaint, which was filed seven 
days prior.  See Dkt. 51.  Plaintiff has therefore only once amended the actual factual allegations 
of his pleading.  Nothing indicates that he sought that prior amendment in bad faith. Moreover, 
with discovery having not yet occurred, this case “is still in its infancy, [so] there would be minimal 
prejudice to Defendant in permitting Plaintiff to make one final amendment.”  Morales, 2020 WL 

2766050, at *10.  The Court emphasizes, however, that Scales should amend only if he is able to 
resolve the pleading deficiencies outlined in this Opinion and Order and is able to plead facts 
demonstrating that Local 6 has acted arbitrarily, discriminatorily, or in bad faith.   
                      IV.  Conclusion                                
For the reasons stated above, Local 6’s motion to dismiss is granted and the Second 
Amended Complaint is dismissed without prejudice.  In the event Scales decides to file another 
amended complaint, he must file it within thirty days of this Opinion and Order.  If Scales fails to 
file a Third Amended Complaint within thirty days, and does not show good cause to excuse the 
failure to do so, the Court will dismiss this action with prejudice.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully 
directed to close the motion pending at Docket Number 59. 
 SO ORDERED.

L]   Ihave previously filed an IFP application in this case, and it is a true and correct 
     representation of my current financial status. 
[]   Ihave not previously filed an IFP application in this case and now attach an original IFP 
     application showing my financial status. 
[]   Ihave previously filed an IFP application in this case, but my financial status has 
     changed. I have attached a new IFP application showing my current financial status. 
2.  Explain why you need an attorney in this case. (Please note that requests for pro bono 
  counsel are rarely granted at the early stages of a case and usually not before the Court has 
  issued a decision on the merits of the case.) If you asked for an attorney earlier in this case, 
  please also explain what has changed since you last asked for an attorney. 

3.  Explain what steps you have taken to find an attorney and with what results. (Please identify 
  the lawyers, law firms or legal clinics you have contacted and their responses to your 
  requests. If you have limited access to the telephone, mail, or other communication methods, 
  or if you otherwise have had difficulty contacting attorneys, please explain.) 

4.  If you need an attorney who speaks a language other than English, state what language(s) you 
  speak:                                                             .

  case may be dismissed.

John P. Cronan, United States District Judge:                             

On January 28, 2022, Plaintiff submitted an application for counsel.  See Dkt. 20.  In 
determining whether to grant an application for counsel, the Court must consider “the merits of 
plaintiff’s case, the plaintiff’s ability to pay for private counsel, his efforts to obtain a lawyer, the 
availability of counsel, and the plaintiff’s ability to gather the facts and deal with the issues if 
unassisted by counsel.”  Cooper v. A. Sargenti Co., Inc., 877 F.2d 170, 172 (2d Cir. 1989) (per 
curiam).  As a threshold matter, to qualify for counsel Plaintiff must demonstrate that his claim 
has substance or a likelihood of success.  See Hodge v. Police Officers, 802 F.2d 58, 60-61 (2d 
Cir. 1986).  In reviewing a request for counsel, the Court must be cognizant of the fact that 
volunteer attorney time is a precious commodity and, thus, should not grant a request for counsel 
indiscriminately.  Cooper, 877 F.2d at 172.                               
After reviewing Plaintiff’s claims in light of the above factors, the Court denies without 
prejudice Plaintiff’s request for counsel to renewal at such time as the existence of a potentially 
meritorious claim may be demonstrated.  The Court notes that Mr. Scales may always reach out to 
the  New  York  Legal  Assistance  Group  (NYLAG)  to  see  if  they  can  assist  help  him.  See 
https://nylag.org/. 
 The Clerk of the Court is directed to terminate Docket No. 20 and to mail a copy of this 
Order to the Plaintiff. 
 SO ORDERED.
