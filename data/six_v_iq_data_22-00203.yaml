outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Ryan Six''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiff-Appellant argued that the district court erred in dismissing his Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction by incorrectly finding that he lacked Article III standing, asserting that receipt of an unwanted debt collection letter after he had directed that all communications go through his attorney constituted a concrete invasion of his privacy interests.

  2. Plaintiff-Appellant contended that the district court erred in denying his motion to strike IQ Data International, Inc.’s affirmative defenses.

  3. Plaintiff-Appellant argued that the district court erred in its resolution of the parties’ joint discovery dispute involving assertions of attorney-client privilege.

  4. Plaintiff-Appellant asserted that the district court erred in its modified grant of attorneys’ fees.

  5. Plaintiff-Appellant further argued that, if the court of appeals concluded he had standing, it should grant summary judgment in his favor rather than remanding, implying that the undisputed facts established a violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1692c(a)(2).'
