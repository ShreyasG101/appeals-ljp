reason_for_appeal: '=== Triumph Foods, LLC, Christensen Farms Midwest, LLC, The Hanor Company of Wisconsin, LLC, New Fashion Pork, LLP, Eichelberger Farms, Inc., and Allied Producers'' Cooperative''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred by dismissing most of their claims without a written order or reasoning on the record, constituting procedural error.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court erred by granting summary judgment sua sponte on their Pike dormant Commerce Clause claim when there were disputed material facts concerning the Massachusetts Act''s burden on interstate commerce and without providing notice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f).

  3. Appellants argued that the district court erred by granting summary judgment sua sponte on their direct-discrimination dormant Commerce Clause claim by holding that the Act did not discriminate against them and without providing notice under FRCP 56(f).

  4. Appellants contended that the Massachusetts Act violates the dormant Commerce Clause by intentionally discriminating against interstate commerce, both in purpose and effect, and by imposing a substantial burden on interstate commerce under the Pike balancing test.

  5. Appellants argued that the Massachusetts Act violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by directly and intentionally targeting and seeking to regulate out-of-state activity, thereby burdening out-of-state pig farmers and pork processors to the benefit of in-state interests.

  6. Appellants contended that the Massachusetts Act is expressly preempted and preempted by conflict under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), as it imposes requirements within the scope of the FMIA on slaughterhouses and creates a class of adulteration unrecognized in federal law.

  7. Appellants argued that the Massachusetts Act is preempted by the Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA) based on principles of conflict preemption, as it requires packers or wholesalers to favor or disfavor pork producers based on location and imposes discriminatory burdens.

  8. Appellants contended that the Massachusetts Act violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause by conflicting with ''Right to Farm'' laws in several states where they operate, such as Missouri, Wyoming, and Indiana.

  9. Appellants argued that the Massachusetts Act is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause because it fails to define what it means to ''engage in the sale'' of prohibited pork products and does not specify the square footage requirements for a breeding pig to ''turn around freely.''

  10. Appellants contended that the Massachusetts Act violates the Import-Export Clause by essentially imposing a duty or tax on out-of-state goods through its imposition of a particular method of raising pigs.'
