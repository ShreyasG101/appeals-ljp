outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Tyrone Walker''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Walker argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Defendants by finding that the periodic reviews of his administrative segregation status were constitutionally meaningful, despite evidence that the reviews were rote, repetitive, and failed to consider his years of good behavior.

  2. Walker contended that the reviews did not provide him with meaningful process as required by the Due Process Clause, because the reviewing officials relied solely on his past violent conduct and did not engage with or acknowledge his recent positive disciplinary record.

  3. Walker asserted that the process was constitutionally deficient because the reviews were often untimely, and he was not provided with copies of his reviews in time to respond or correct misunderstandings before subsequent reviews occurred.

  4. Walker claimed that the reviewing officials failed to provide guidance or criteria for how he could demonstrate his readiness to be released from administrative segregation, despite his repeated requests for such information.

  5. Walker argued that the Deputy Commissioner’s review was a mere ''rubber stamp,'' as the final decision was often generic, lacked individualized reasoning, and was sometimes completed by subordinates in advance.

  6. Walker contended that the officials’ reasoning for discounting his good behavior—attributing it to the restrictive conditions of solitary confinement—was circular and pretextual, further indicating a lack of meaningful review.

  7. Walker asserted that the delays and failures in providing timely reviews and opportunities to respond deprived him of the process due under the Constitution.

  8. Walker argued that the district court erred in finding Defendants entitled to qualified immunity, because the right to meaningful periodic review of administrative segregation status was clearly established.'
