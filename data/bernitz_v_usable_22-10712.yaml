outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Steven Bernitz''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Bernitz argued that the district court failed to fully examine USAble''s structural conflict of interest as both adjudicator of claims and payor of benefits as required by law.

  2. Bernitz contended that the district court failed to analyze whether USAble followed specific provisions of the Plan, including the Plan''s narrow definition of ''disability'' and its requirement that USAble explain any disagreement with or non-reliance on the medical assessments of Bernitz''s treating physicians.

  3. Bernitz argued that the record evidence conclusively establishes that he is disabled under the Plan''s definition of disability.

  4. Bernitz asserted that USAble''s decision was improperly influenced by its structural conflict of interest and that case-specific factors suggested bias in the claims process.

  5. Bernitz claimed that USAble failed to apply the Plan''s definition of disability to the evidence and did not provide the Plan''s standard of disability to its medical reviewers.

  6. Bernitz argued that USAble relied on evidence such as his weight loss, exercise, and travel in a manner inconsistent with the Plan''s requirements and failed to properly consider or explain its disagreement with the opinions of his treating physicians and vocational experts.

  7. Bernitz contended that USAble improperly used the Social Security total disability standard instead of the Plan''s definition.

  8. Bernitz challenged the reliability of unfavorable reports and medical assessments and argued that favorable, conflicting evidence should have prevailed over the adverse evidence.'
