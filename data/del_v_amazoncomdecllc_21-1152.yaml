reason_for_appeal: '=== Javier Del Rio, Colin Meunier, and Aaron Delaroche, on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated employees''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in holding that Connecticut’s wage laws and regulations do not require compensation for time spent undergoing mandatory security screenings at their place of employment.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court improperly incorporated federal law, specifically the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and the federal Portal-to-Portal Act, into the interpretation of Connecticut’s wage statutes and regulations.

  3. Appellants claimed they are owed straight-time wages under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-72, Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-71b et seq., and Conn. Agencies Regs. § 31-60-11, and overtime wages under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-68 and Conn. Gen. Stat. § 31-76b(2)(A) et seq., for time spent in mandatory security screenings.

  4. Appellants objected to the district court’s grant of summary judgment for Defendants, asserting that there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether the time spent in security screenings is compensable under Connecticut law.

  5. Appellants raised the issue of whether a de minimis exception applies to the time spent in mandatory security screenings under Connecticut law.'
