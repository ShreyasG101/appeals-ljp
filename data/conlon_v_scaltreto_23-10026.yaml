reason_for_appeal: '=== Robert P. Conlon and Betsy A. Conlon, Personal Representatives of the Estate of Michael Conlon (Plaintiffs)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Fourth Amendment excessive force claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Officer-Defendants based on both the deployment of the beanbag shotgun and the fatal shooting of Michael Conlon.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that the Officer-Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive force claims because their conduct violated clearly established law.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA) claim against the Officer-Defendants, asserting that the use of the beanbag shotgun constituted threats, intimidation, or coercion under the statute.

  4. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in dismissing their Monell claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Newton, arguing that the City failed to train and supervise its officers regarding the use of deadly force, beanbag shotguns, and responses to mental health emergencies, and that this failure constituted deliberate indifference.

  5. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act against the City of Newton, asserting that the City failed to accommodate Michael Conlon’s disability and failed to adequately train its officers to respond to individuals with mental illness.

  6. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in dismissing their ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims on the grounds that the police failed to provide reasonable accommodations to Michael Conlon during the incident.'
