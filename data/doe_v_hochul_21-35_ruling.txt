           MEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER                             
I.   INTRODUCTION                                                         
On January 12, 2021, Plaintiffs filed suit against the State of New York and several of its 
officials (collectively, “Defendants”), challenging certain amendments and provisions of the 
New York Reproductive Health Act (“RHA”). Dkt. No. 1 (“Original Complaint”). On October 
26, 2021, the Court dismissed all seven causes of action from the Original Complaint, Dkt. No. 
59 (“Dismissal Order”), and entered judgment in Defendants’ favor, Dkt. No. 60 (“Judgment”).  
Now before the Court is a set of post-judgment motions filed by Plaintiffs in the wake of 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022), seeking to reopen the 
Judgment pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b); and to file an amended 
complaint pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2) (collectively, the “Post-Dobbs Motions”). See Dkt. No. 80 
(“Notice of Motion”); see also Dkt. No. 83 (“September 2022 Order”) at 5–7, 12 (construing 
Plaintiff’s “Substitution Motion,” Dkt. No. 80-1, “as a renewed motion to reopen the Judgment 
under Rule 59(e)”). For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the Post-Dobbs Motions, as 
well as the related motions to appoint next friend representatives, Dkt. Nos. 61-5 to -6, and to file 
anonymously, Dkt. Nos. 61-7 to -10.                                       
II.  BACKGROUND                                                           
On January 12, 2021, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants, challenging certain 
amendments and provisions of the RHA. See Original Compl. Plaintiffs raised seven counts: 
  1.  A Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim on behalf of Jane Smith, 
     Jill Park,1 and other similarly situated women, alleging that Penal Law § 125.05, 

     as amended by the RHA, violates their right to freedom from state-created threats 
     of violence, see Original Compl. ¶¶ 238–43;                     
  2.  A First Amendment claim on behalf of Smith, Park, and other similarly situated 
     women, alleging that Penal Law § 125.05, as amended by the RHA, violates their 
     right to legal redress, see id. ¶¶ 244–54;                      
  3.  Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process and equal protection claims on 
     behalf of “Viable Unborn Children,” id. ¶ 255, alleging that the Defendants, in 
     enacting the RHA, have “illegally discriminated against vulnerable viable unborn 
     children,” id. ¶ 277, and have denied them their “fundamental rights” to “life, 

     liberty, equal protection, autonomy, dignity, and justice,” id. ¶ 278; 
  4.  A First Amendment claim on behalf of “Viable Unborn Children,” id. ¶ 279, 
     alleging that Penal Law § 125.05, as amended by the RHA, violates their right to 
     legal redress, id. ¶¶ 279–89;                                   
  5.  A Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim on behalf of “Abortion 
     Survivors,” id. ¶ 290, alleging that the RHA’s “repeal of the second-physician 



1 On March 16, 2021, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motions for leave to file anonymously under 
these pseudonyms in connection with the Original Complaint. Dkt. No. 37.  
     requirement” for abortions after viability violates their right to freedom from 
     state-created danger, including death, see id. ¶¶ 290–97;       
  6.  A Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claim on behalf of “Abortion 
     Survivors,” id. ¶ 298, alleging that Defendants’ failure to ensure proper reporting 
     of live births resulting from attempted abortions after viability violates their right 

     to equal protection under the law, see id. ¶¶ 298–318; and      
  7.  Two Fourteenth Amendment due process claims on behalf of Dr. Amy Moe and 
     other similarly situated physicians, alleging that two provisions of New York’s 
     Public Health Law, as amended by the RHA, are void for undue vagueness, see 
     id. ¶¶ 319–52.                                                  
On March 12, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Dkt. No. 35. On October 26, 2021, this Court dismissed the 
first two counts for failure to state a claim, and the remaining causes of action for lack of 
standing. See Dismissal Order. The Court then entered Judgment in Defendants’ favor. See J. 

After Judgment was entered, Plaintiffs filed several post-judgment motions, the history of 
which is recounted in detail in the Court’s September 2022 Order. See Sept. 2022 Order at 2–5. 
In the first set of post-judgment motions, Plaintiffs sought to reopen and amend the Judgment 
pursuant to Rule 59(e), and to file a proposed amended complaint (the “Original PAC”) pursuant 
to Rule 15(a)(2). See Dkt. No. 61. While those post-judgment motions were still pending, the 
Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 
505 U.S. 833 (1992), and “returned” “the authority to regulate abortion . . . to the people and 
their elected representatives.” Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2279. According to Plaintiffs, the Dobbs 
decision greatly “impact[ed]” their first set of post-judgment motions, “as well as the case 
generally, in . . . significant ways.” Dkt. No. 78 at 1, 4. Therefore, Plaintiffs abandoned their 
Original PAC, see Sept. 2022 Order at 7–8, and filed a second set of post-judgment motions—
i.e., the Post-Dobbs Motions—to facilitate the filing of an updated proposed amended complaint 
(the “Post-Dobbs PAC”) that, among other things, “incorporate[d] revised and additional claims 
to reflect the changed constitutional boundaries after Dobbs . . . .” Dkt. No. 80-2 ¶ 25.  

Given the increasing complexity of the post-judgment litigation in the wake of Dobbs, the 
Court issued the September 2022 Order to clarify what remained at issue in the post-judgment 
litigation, and to set deadlines for Defendants’ response, and Plaintiffs’ reply, to the Post-Dobbs 
Motions. See generally Sept. 2022 Order. In the same Order, the Court also denied Plaintiffs’ 
request from the first set of motions to reinstate Counts Three and Four, which brought 
Fourteenth Amendment and First Amendment claims on behalf of “Viable Unborn Children.” 
Plaintiffs suggested that the Court’s dismissal of those counts was in error, but the Court rejected 
Plaintiffs’ attempt to relitigate standing because Plaintiffs could have raised their novel standing 
argument before the decision on the motion to dismiss issued. See id. at 10–11 (citing Bannister 

v. Davis, 140 S. Ct. 1698, 1703 (2020), and Slattery v. Clinton, No. 96-CV-2366, 1997 WL 
291868, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 2, 1997)).                                   
After the Court granted Defendants an extension to oppose to the Post-Dobbs Motions, 
Defendants filed their Response on October 11, 2022. Dkt. No. 86 (“Defendants’ Response”). 
The following week, Plaintiffs filed their Reply. Dkt. No. 87 (“Plaintiffs’ Reply”). 
III.  LEGAL STANDARD                                                      
A.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2)                         
“In the ordinary course, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that courts ‘should 
freely give leave’ to amend a complaint ‘when justice so requires.’” Williams v. Citigroup Inc., 
659 F.3d 208, 212 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2)). “This permissive standard is 
consistent with [the Second Circuit’s] ‘strong preference for resolving disputes on the merits.’” 
Williams, 659 F.3d at 212–13 (quoting New York v. Green, 420 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.2005)). 
The Supreme Court has further instructed:                                 
     If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff 
     may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an   
     opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any 
     apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or   
     dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure 
     deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to 
     the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility 
     of amendment, etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules require, 
     be “freely given.”                                              

Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (citation omitted). “Futility is a determination, as a 
matter of law, that proposed amendments would fail to cure prior deficiencies or to state a claim 
under Rule 12(b)(6) . . . .” Pyskaty v. Wide World of Cars, LLC, 856 F.3d 216, 224–25 (2d Cir. 
2017) (quoting Panther Partners Inc. v. Ikanos Commc’ns, Inc., 681 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir. 
2012)). To assess whether an amended complaint would state a claim, courts consider “the 
proposed amendment[s] . . . along with the remainder of the complaint,” Starr v. Sony BMG 
Music Entm’t, 592 F.3d 314, 323 n.3 (2d Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 1168 (2011), 
accepting as true all non-conclusory factual allegations therein, and drawing all reasonable 
inferences in the plaintiff’s favor, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). 
“It is well established that a party seeking to file an amended complaint post-judgment 
must first have the judgment vacated or set aside pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or 60(b).” 
Metzler Inv. Gmbh v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2020) (cleaned 
up). “[I]t would be contradictory to entertain a motion to amend the complaint” without “a valid 
basis to vacate the previously entered judgment.” Nat’l Petrochemical Co. of Iran v. M/T Stolt 
Sheaf, 930 F.3d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 1991). “To hold otherwise would enable the liberal 
amendment policy of Rule 15(a) to be employed in a way that is contrary to the philosophy 
favoring finality of judgments and the expeditious termination of litigation.” Williams, 659 F.3d 
at 212 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Nat’l Petrochemical, 930 F.2d at 
245).                                                                     

B.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e)                            
Rule 59(e) provides that a “motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later 
than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). Rule 6(b)(2) prohibits 
district courts from “extend[ing] the time to act” under Rule 59(e). Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2). “The 
filing of a Rule 59(e) motion within the 28-day period ‘suspends the finality of the original 
judgment’ for purposes of an appeal.” Bannister, 140 S. Ct. at 1703 (citation omitted). 
A court may grant a Rule 59(e) motion “only when the [movant] identifies ‘an 
intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a 
clear error or prevent manifest injustice.’” Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL 

Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat’l 
Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992)).                       
“[C]ourts will not address new arguments or evidence that the moving party could have 
raised before the decision issued.” Banister, 140 S. Ct. at 1703; see also Slattery, 1997 WL 
291868, at *1. “By contrast, courts may consider new arguments based on an ‘intervening 
change in controlling law’ and ‘newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence.’” 
Bannister, 140 S. Ct. at 1703 n.2 (citing 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Fed. Prac. & Proc. 
§ 2810.1, 161–62 (3d ed. 2012)). When a previously rejected legal theory takes on new 
significance due to an intervening development in the law, courts may exercise discretion to 
allow a party to revive that theory pursuant to Rule 59(e). See, e.g., Bryant v. New Jersey Dep’t 
of Transp., 998 F. Supp. 438, 440–43 (D.N.J. 1998) (reversing a prior dismissal for lack of 
standing “in light of” a Supreme Court decision “revisit[ing] the zone of interests test”).  
With respect to filing an amended complaint post-judgment, the Second Circuit has also 
found that “it is an abuse of discretion to deny a motion under Rule 59(e)—to prevent a 

‘manifest injustice,’ . . . —when the plaintiff was never given an opportunity to replead in the 
first place.” Metzler, 970 F.3d at 144 (interpreting Foman, 371 U.S. 178).  
C.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)                            
Rule 60(b) provides that a court may relieve a party from a final judgment for the 
following reasons:                                                        
     (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;      

     (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could 
     not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 
     59(b);                                                          

     (3)  fraud  (whether  previously  called  intrinsic  or  extrinsic), 
     misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;          

     (4) the judgment is void;                                       

     (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is 
     based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or 
     applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or            

     (6) any other reason that justifies relief.                     

Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). “A motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time—and 
for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the 
date of the proceeding.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). “[A] Rule 60(b) motion is properly denied 
where it seeks only to relitigate issues already decided.” Pastor v. P’ship for Children’s Rts., 856 
F. App’x 343, 345 (2d Cir. 2021) (summary order) (citing Zerman v. Jacobs, 751 F.2d 82, 84–85 
(2d Cir. 1984)). And unlike in the Rule 59(e) context, “a Rule 60(b) motion ‘does not affect the 
[original] judgment’s finality or suspend its operation.’” Bannister, 140 S. Ct. at 1710 (brackets 
in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(2)).                          
The Supreme Court has found that “[a]s a matter of text, structure, and history . . . a 
‘mistake’ under Rule 60(b)(1) includes a judge’s errors of law.” Kemp v. United States, 142 S. 

Ct. 1856, 1861–62 (2022). Such errors need not be “obvious legal mistakes . . . .” Id. at 1862 
(internal quotation marks omitted). “[C]ourts have [also] long found that excusable neglect may 
involve legal error.” Id. at 1863 (collecting cases). “And [courts] have a similar history of 
granting relief based on ‘judicial inadvertence.’” Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting Larson v. 
Heritage Square Assocs., 952 F.2d 1533, 1536 (8th Cir. 1992), and citing O’Tell v. New York, 
N.H. & H.R. Co., 236 F.2d 472, 475 (2d Cir. 1956)).                       
As for Rule 60(b)(6), the Second Circuit has described that subsection as “a catch-all 
provision that ‘is properly invoked only when there are extraordinary circumstances justifying 
relief, when the judgment may work an extreme and undue hardship, and when the asserted 

grounds for relief are not recognized in clauses (1)–(5) of the Rule.’” Metzler, 970 F.3d at 143 
(quoting Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 1986)). “[A] change in decisional law 
rarely constitutes the ‘extraordinary circumstances’ required to prevail on a Rule 60(b)(6) 
motion.” Stevens v. Miller, 676 F.3d 62, 69 (2d Cir. 2012) (citations omitted).  
With respect to filing an amended complaint post-judgment, “it might be appropriate in a 
proper case to take into account the nature of [a] proposed amend[ed] [complaint] in deciding 
whether to vacate the previously entered judgment[]” under this catch-all provision codified at 
Rule 60(b)(6). Metzler, 970 F.3d at 145 (quoting Nat’l Petrochemical, 930 F.3d at 245). 
IV.  DISCUSSION                                                           
A.  Timeliness of the Post-Dobbs Motions                             
Defendants do not contest the timeliness of the Post-Dobbs Motions in their October 11, 
2022, Response. See Defs.’ Resp. However, the Court undertakes this timeliness analysis sua 
sponte because courts lack the “power to extend the time” to file motions pursuant to Rules 59(e) 

and 60(b), see Lichtenberg v. Besicorp Group Inc., 204 F.3d 397, 401, 404 (2d Cir. 2000) 
(interpreting the jurisdictional significance of Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)).   
The Court entered Judgment on October 26, 2021. See J. Twenty-eight days later, 
Plaintiffs filed motions pursuant to Rule 59(e) and Rule 15(a)(2) to reopen the Judgment to 
facilitate the filing of the Original PAC. See Dkt. No. 61. Then, before the Court issued a 
decision on the first set of motions, Plaintiffs filed their second set of post-judgment motions—
i.e., the Post-Dobbs Motions—on August 19, 2022, nearly ten months after the Court entered 
Judgment. See Notice of Mot. Plaintiffs and the Court have identified Rule 59(e), Rule 60(b)(1), 
and Rule 60(b)(6) as the purported bases for hearing the Post-Dobbs Motions after Judgment was 

entered. See Notice of Mot.; Dkt. No. 80-5 (“Plaintiffs’ Rules 60(b) and 15(a)(2) 
Memorandum”); Sept. 2022 Order at 5–7, 12 (construing the “Substitution Motion,” Dkt. No. 
80-1, as a renewed Rule 59(e) motion).                                    
To determine whether a court has the power to entertain a Rule 60(b)(1) motion, a court 
must ask whether the movant filed the motion before “a year after the entry of the judgment,” 
and “within a reasonable time . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). Courts in the Second Circuit “have 
recognized 18 months as a ‘reasonable time’ for bringing a Rule 60(b)(6) motion, and have 
required parties who delayed for more than 18 months, but not less, to demonstrate good cause 
for the delay.” Wright v. Poole, 81 F. Supp. 3d 280, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Here, Plaintiffs moved 
pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) within ten months of the entry of the Judgment. Accordingly, 
Plaintiffs’ Rule 60(b)(1) motion is timely. As for whether a court may entertain a Rule 60(b)(6) 
motion, a court need only ask whether the movant filed it “within a reasonable time . . . .” Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 60(c)(1). Since Plaintiffs also moved under Rule 60(b)(6) within ten months of the 
entry of the Judgment, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ Rule 60(b)(6) motion is similarly timely. 

As for a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), a court typically examines whether it was “filed 
no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). However, “if two 
motions to alter or amend are made, the time period for the second motion begins with the 
court’s decision on the first motion.” Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, 11 Fed. Prac. & 
Proc. Civ. § 2817 (3d ed.); see, e.g., Agrocomplect, AD v. Republic of Iraq, 262 F.R.D. 18, 21 
(D.D.C. 2009). Given that this Court had not issued a decision on the first Rule 59(e) motion 
when Plaintiffs filed their renewed Rule 59(e) motion after the Dobbs decision, the Court finds 
that the renewed Rule 59(e) is timely as well.                            
Given that the Post-Dobbs Motions are timely, the Court proceeds to examine whether 

Plaintiffs are entitled to the relief requested therein.                  
B.  Motion to Vacate the Judgment Pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1)          
In the Post-Dobbs Motions, Plaintiffs have renewed their earlier Rule 59(e) argument that 
the Court erroneously “dismissed two claims without considering an alternative basis for 
standing, which resulted in the dismissal of the Medically-Viable Unborn Children Class’ Counts 
Three and Four.” Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 12. But this time, they fashion their 
request to reinstate Counts Three and Four through the lens of Rule 60(b)(1), which permits a 
district court to “correct its own mistakes that are ‘of a substantive legal nature,’ and ‘its own 
mistake[s] of fact.’” Id. at 18.                                          
Much of this request recycles an argument that the Court already rejected in the 
September 2022 Order. For instance, in the original Rule 59(e) motion, Plaintiffs argued that that 
the denial of next friend appointment should not have precluded this Court from finding that “the 
minors compromising the Viable Unborn Children” class have standing to pursue constitutional 
claims directly in federal court. Dkt. No. 61-1 at 18–21. That is because, according to Plaintiffs’ 

counsel, they directly “represent . . . the minors compromising the Viable Unborn Children” 
class. Id. at 19. However, the Court rejected this argument. See Sept. 2022 Order at 9–12. 
Plaintiffs advance a substantially similar argument in the present Rule 60(b)(1) motion. Compare 
Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 19–21, with Dkt. No. 61-1 at 18–21. But as noted earlier, 
“a Rule 60(b) motion is properly denied where it seeks only to relitigate issues already decided.” 
Pastor, 856 F. App’x at 345 (citing Zerman, 751 F.2d at 84–85). Accordingly, the Court denies 
the Rule 60(b)(1) motion insofar as Plaintiffs seek to reinstate Counts Three and Four from the 
Original Complaint due to an alleged error in the Court’s standing analysis. 
Plaintiffs separately advocate for vacating the Judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) 

because of Dobbs, since “[a] change in decisional law has also been recognized as ‘very special 
facts’ and grounds for vacation of a judgment pursuant to [that] Rule . . . .” Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 
15(a)(2) Mem. at 21. Plaintiffs rely on Tarkington v. United States Lines Co., where the Second 
Circuit in 1955 granted a motion under Rule 60(b) “to correct a mistake of the court[]” where the 
trial judge had directed a verdict under then-applicable law that was overturned by the Supreme 
Court just eleven days after judgment was entered, and where a motion to vacate was made just 
ten days thereafter. 222 F.2d 358, 359–60 (2d Cir. 1955). However, the Tarkington court never 
explicitly referenced subsection (1) in its very limited analysis. See id. And while the Second 
Circuit interpreted Tarkington as applying to Rule 60(b)(1) in 1964, see Schildhaus v. Moe, 335 
F.2d 529, 531 (2d Cir. 1964), the Second Circuit has more recently indicated that “a change in 
decisional law” after judgment is entered is more appropriately construed as “an extraordinary 
circumstance” possibly warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(6), see United Airlines, Inc. v. Brien, 
588 F.3d 158, 175–76 (2d Cir. 2009). So too has Justice Sotomayor. See Kemp, 142 S. Ct. at 
1865 (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (“I join the Court’s opinion with the understanding that nothing 

in it casts doubt on the availability of Rule 60(b)(6) to reopen a judgment in extraordinary 
circumstances, including a change in controlling law.” (collecting cases)). Even when district 
courts in this Circuit have applied Rule 60(b)(1) to analyze whether a post-judgment change in 
the law warranted relief, they have still emphasized that relief may only be granted “upon a 
showing of exceptional circumstances,” which closely tracks the analysis courts engage in when 
analyzing a motion brought pursuant to the catch-all provision of Rule 60(b)(6). See, e.g., CIT 
Bank, N.A. v. Zisman, No. 17-CV-2126, 2022 WL 17400908, at *3–5 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2022) 
(emphasizing that relief under Rule 60(b)(1) for a post-judgment change in the law could only be 
granted “upon a showing of exceptional circumstances” (quoting Nemaizer, 793 F.2d at 63)).  

Given the above, the Court will address Plaintiffs’ request to vacate the Judgment in light 
of Dobbs by applying Rule 60(b)(6), as opposed to Rule 60(b)(1). It strains credulity that the 
ordinary meaning of the term “mistake” in Rule 60(b)(1) would encompass this Court’s failure to 
anticipate Dobbs in October 2021, when it entered Judgment in this case. Cf. CIT Bank, 2022 
WL 17400908, at *5 (noting that “it strains credulity that the ordinary meaning of the term 
‘mistake’ in Rule 60(b)(1) would encompass [the court] failing to address an issue never raised” 
by the parties before judgment was entered (cleaned up)).                 
C.  Motion to Reopen or Vacate the Judgment Due to a Change in Controlling Law 
  and Extraordinary Circumstances Under Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) 

Plaintiffs contend that the Dobbs decision itself constitutes a “change in controlling law” 
and “an extraordinary circumstance” warranting vacation of the Judgment. See Pl.’s Rules 60(b) 
& 15(a)(2) Mem. at 12–17; Dkt. No. 80-1 at 15. According to Plaintiffs, “[t]he Supreme Court’s 
decision in Dobbs eliminated what had previously been regarded as a fundamental right, 
destroyed the foundation for the New York’s RHA [which sought to protect the rights identified 
in Roe, 410 U.S. 113], and otherwise reshaped the constitutional contours around which 
Plaintiffs have shaped their suit.” Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 12.  
Defendants respond that “[c]ontrary to Plaintiffs’ assertions”:      
     Dobbs does not impact the constitutional matters implicated in this 
     litigation and does not strengthen Plaintiffs’ claims in any way. It is 
     undisputed  that  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in  Dobbs  is  a 
     landmark decision in which the Court held that the United States 
     Constitution  does  not  confer  a  right  to  obtain  an  abortion  and 
     overruled Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, to that  
     extent. However, what is absent from Plaintiffs’ papers is that the 
     Supreme Court also held in Dobbs that the individual states have full 
     power to regulate abortion, which is precisely what the RHA does. 
     And . . . the New York State Legislature passed the RHA in 2019 
     which enacted into state law a statutory protection for abortion as a 
     state-recognized fundamental right.                             

Defs.’ Resp. at 9–10 (citations omitted). Defendants add:                 
     While it is true, as Plaintiffs point out repeatedly in their motion 
     papers, that . . . Defendants cited to Roe v. Wade and Planned  
     Parenthood v. Casey in their motion to dismiss as well as in their 
     opposition papers to Plaintiffs’ original motions under Rule 59(e) 
     and  Rule  60(b),  those  citations  were  not  determinative  of 
     Defendants’ arguments. . . . [T]he subsequent rescinding of [the 
     federal constitutional] right [to obtain an abortion without undue 
     interference from the government] does not change the underlying 
     issue here: that New York has the right to legislate such a right, and 
     it has done so. Nothing about Dobbs affects New York’s ability to 
     protect reproductive rights by a statute like the RHA; in fact, Dobbs 
     specifically holds that it can do so.                           
Defs.’ Resp. at 10 (citation omitted).                                    
While the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that Dobbs represents a “seismic constitutional 
shift,” Dkt. No. 78 at 4, the Court cannot agree with them that Dobbs represents a change of 
controlling law that would have warranted a different outcome in the Judgment. Notably, the 
Court’s October 26, 2021, Dismissal Order does not cite to Roe at all, see Dismissal Order, and 
only cites to Casey once for its dicta that “[m]en and women of good conscience can disagree, 
and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications 
of terminating a pregnancy,” see Dismissal Order at 1 (brackets in original) (quoting 505 U.S. at 
850). In fact, the Dobbs majority cited positively to that very same Casey dicta this Court relied 

on in the Dismissal Order, observing that “even . . . Casey did not question the good faith of 
abortion opponents,” Dobbs, 142. S. Ct. at 2256 ((“Men and women of good conscience can 
disagree . . . about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy even 
in its earliest stage”) (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 850)).                
While the Dobbs decision certainly overruled the core holding of Casey by stripping 
people of their federal right to sue in courts of the United States to stop the government from 
unduly burdening their ability to obtain an abortion, see Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2242, the Dobbs 
decision did not impose any affirmative obligation on state governments to prohibit abortion. As 
Defendants correctly point out, the Supreme Court’s holding in Dobbs expressly relegated the 
authority to regulate or prohibit abortion to state governments, see id. at 2279, 2284. And the 

Dobbs majority, in dicta, clearly noted that its “opinion is not based on any view about if and 
when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth.” Id. at 2261. Therefore, 
Plaintiffs’ contention that Dobbs has made available “a broader and more robust cause of action” 
for the class of “Viable Unborn Children” to assert, Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 23, is 
without merit, and plainly misreads Dobbs.                                
Plaintiffs’ related argument that the Dobbs majority “recogni[zed] that there is something 
different about cases involving an unborn human being,” id. at 24 (citing Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 
2236–37, 2243, 2256–58), does not change the Court’s analysis on the above point. Contrary to 

Plaintiffs’ argument, the majority’s recognition that state governments have “legitimate 
interests” in the “respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development,” 
Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284 (citing Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 157–58 (2007)), says 
nothing about the applicability of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process and Equal 
Protection Clauses to prenatal life. Rather, the statement merely conveys the majority’s position 
that “preserv[ing] . . . prenatal life at all stages of development” is a legitimate exercise of state 
governments’ police power. Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. at 2284; see generally U.S. Const. amend. X 
(“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the 
States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”); Jacobson v. Commonwealth of 

Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24–25 (1905) (“The authority of the state to enact [a] statute is . . . 
commonly called the police power—a power which the state did not surrender when becoming a 
member of the Union under the Constitution.”). Nowhere in Dobbs does the majority hold—or 
even suggest in dicta—that prenatal life qualifies as “persons” under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
See Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. 2228.                                               
The Court need not analyze the remainder of Plaintiffs’ arguments concerning the impact 
of Dobbs on this case in more detail. It is abundantly clear to this Court that even if Dobbs had 
been issued before the Court’s October 26, 2021, Dismissal Order, the Court would have reached 
the same result. The Court’s determination that Count One failed to state a claim because the 
alleged conduct did not “fall[] under the ambit of th[e] state-created danger exception,” 
Dismissal Order at 13, would not have changed in the wake of Dobbs—a decision which has no 
bearing on that particular doctrine. See generally Dismissal Order at 11 (finding that “[t]he state-
created danger exception requires some form of affirmative, rather than passive, conduct on the 
part of a government actor that communicates, explicitly or implicitly, official sanction of private 

violence” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Nor would the Court’s determination that Count 
Two failed to state a claim have changed. See id. at 14, 16 (reasoning that “a private citizen does 
not have a constitutional right to bring a criminal complaint against another individual,” and that 
“Plaintiffs [did not allege that they] experience[d] a . . . wholesale denial of judicial relief”). 
Dobbs does not abrogate any of the authorities the Court relied on in reaching either 
determination with respect to Counts One and Two. As for the remaining counts in the Original 
Complaint, the Court dismissed them for lack of Article III standing, and Plaintiffs have not 
demonstrated how Dobbs would have necessarily changed those determinations as well. See 
Dismissal Order at 16–20.                                                 

Accordingly, the Court denies the Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)(6) motions insofar as 
Plaintiffs seek to reopen and vacate the Judgment on the ground that the Dobbs decision itself 
constitutes a “change in controlling law” and “an extraordinary circumstance” warranting a 
different outcome in the Judgment.                                        
D.  Motion to Reopen or Vacate the Judgment Pursuant to File the Post-Dobbs PAC 
  Under Rule 15(a)(2), Rule 59(e), and Rule 60(b)(6)                 

Finally, Plaintiffs argue that since they “never had the opportunity to amend their 
Complaint[]” before Judgment was entered, the Court should reopen the case to honor “the 
liberal spirit of Rule 15” by allowing at least one amendment in the form of the Post-Dobbs 
PAC. Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 10, 23. Plaintiffs also contend that the Court should 
permit amendment now so that the Court may decide the merits of their post-Dobbs claims on a 
dispositive motion rather than on a motion to amend. Dkt. No. 80-1 at 16.  
Anticipating Defendants’ futility arguments, Plaintiffs add that “none of the grounds 
traditionally used to deny . . . a request [to amend],” such as “futility . . . are present” here. Dkt. 
No. 80-1 at 12–13. Central to their contention that the Post-Dobbs PAC is not futile is the Dobbs 

decision itself, which they claim has “augmented . . . the constitutional grounds for the instant 
lawsuit . . . .” Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 24. Plaintiffs also argue against futility 
because various purported improvements in the Post-Dobbs PAC cure the pleading deficiencies 
this Court identified in the Original Complaint. Id. at 25–26; Dkt. No. 80-1 at 10, 13. 
In their Response, Defendants emphasize that “a successful motion to vacate the 
Judgment is a pre-requisite to Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file” the Post-Dobbs PAC, Defs.’ 
Resp. at 7, and that Plaintiffs—regardless of the contents of the Post-Dobbs PAC—“fail to 
satisfy the demanding standards of Rules 59(e) or 60(b),” id. at 9. Even if Plaintiffs were to 
satisfy those “demanding standards,” Defendants argue that the Court should still deny leave to 

amend on the grounds of “futility” and “undue delay.” Id. at 14–21. In addition, Defendants urge 
the Court not to reopen the Judgment simply to determine the merits of the Post-Dobbs PAC in a 
future round of dispositive briefing, precisely because the Post-Dobbs PAC is futile. Id. at 14. 
The Court begins its analysis on amendment by addressing Plaintiffs’ threshold argument 
that it would be better to litigate the merits of the Post-Dobbs PAC on a dispositive motion after 
amendment is allowed, rather than through the backdoor of futility. While this Court has granted 
motions for leave to amend for this very reason, see, e.g., Fletcher v. Vill. of Lake Placid, No. 
22-CV-00314, 2023 WL 2456066, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2023) (Kahn, J.) (“declin[ing] to 
decide the merits of defendants’ futility arguments at this juncture[]” and thus “grant[ing] the 
plaintiff’s motion to amend without addressing the merits” (internal quotation marks omitted)); 
Phoenix of Albany, LLC v. Cnty. of Albany, No. 22-CV-0577, 2023 WL 1861530, at *3 
(N.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2023) (Kahn, J.) (same); the post-judgment context is necessarily different. 
The mere fact that Judgment has already been entered cautions against reopening the case to 
permit amendment, especially if it is clear to the Court that the amendment is futile. See 

generally Williams, 659 F.3d at 212 (emphasizing “the philosophy favoring finality of judgments 
and the expeditious termination of litigation[]” when a party seeks to amend post-judgment 
(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).                         
Furthermore, the concern about affording a plaintiff at least one opportunity to rebut a 
defendant’s futility arguments—when raised on the first time in opposition to a plaintiff’s cross-
motion to amend (in response to a defendant’s prior motion to dismiss)—is plainly inapplicable 
here. Cf. Phoenix, 2023 WL 1861530, at *3 (observing that “as a matter of fairness . . . courts . . . 
have declined to address [futility] arguments raised for the first time [in opposition to a cross-
motion to amend] that a plaintiff could not respond to[]” under the Local Rules). In their 

Response to the Post-Dobbs Motions, Defendants raised their futility arguments, Defs.’ Resp. at 
14–21, and Plaintiffs had an opportunity to rebut them in their Reply, Pl.’s Reply at 9–11. 
Accordingly, the Court will not reopen or vacate the Judgment solely on the ground that 
litigating the merits of the Post-Dobbs PAC is better suited to dispositive briefing on a motion to 
dismiss.                                                                  
Next, the Court addresses the proper standard to apply to Plaintiffs’ request to reopen or 
vacate the Judgment on the ground that they “never had the opportunity to amend their 
Complaint[]” before Judgment was entered. Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 10. While 
Defendants are technically correct that “a successful motion to vacate the Judgment is a pre-
requisite to Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file” the Post-Dobbs PAC, Defs.’ Resp. at 7; see 
Metzler, 970 F.3d at 142 (“[A] party seeking to file an amended complaint post-judgment must 
first have the judgment vacated or set aside pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or 60(b).”); in 
practice, the order of operations is not so clear-cut. For instance, the Second Circuit in Metzler 
interpreted the Supreme Court’s decision in Foman, 371 U.S. 178, to mean “that it is an abuse of 

discretion to deny a motion under Rule 59(e)—to prevent a ‘manifest injustice,’ although the 
[Supreme] Court did not say so explicitly—when the plaintiff was never given an opportunity to 
replead in the first place.” Metzler, 970 F.3d at 144 (interpreting Foman, 371 U.S. 178). 
Therefore, “it might be appropriate in a proper case to take into account the nature of [a] 
proposed amend[ed] [complaint] in deciding whether to vacate the previously entered 
judgment[]” under Rule 60(b)(6). Metzler, 970 F.3d at 145 (quoting Nat’l Petrochemical, 930 
F.3d at 245). Accordingly, “even when a plaintiff has not had [even] one . . . opportunity [to 
amend before judgment], a district court may properly deny her post-judgment motion for leave 
to amend if her proposed amendments would be futile.” Shull v. TBTF Prods., Inc., No. 20-3529, 

2021 WL 3027181 (2d Cir. July 19, 2021) (summary order) (citing Williams, 659 F.3d at 214). 
Here, the Court entered Judgment before Plaintiffs could seek leave to file an amended 
complaint. Because Plaintiffs were “never given an opportunity to replead in the first place,” 
Metzler, 970 F.3d at 144, the Court will therefore examine the “nature of the [Post-Dobbs PAC] 
in deciding whether to vacate the previously entered [J]udgment,” id. at 145, whether that be 
under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b)(6).                                        
     1.  Counts One and Two                                          
Counts One and Two in the Post-Dobbs PAC are virtually identical to Counts One and 
Two in the Original Complaint. Compare Dkt. No. 80-4 (“Post-Dobbs PAC”) ¶¶ 263–78, with 
Original Compl. ¶¶ 238–54. The Court previously dismissed those counts for failure to state a 
claim. See Dismissal Order at 11–16. And as the Court noted earlier in this opinion, Dobbs does 
not alter the Court’s analysis with respect to either of those counts. See supra Section IV.C.  
Apart from the impact of Dobbs, Plaintiffs argue that “[t]he Post-Dobbs PAC addresses 
the Court’s concerns with respect to Counts One and Two by including additional allegations 

relating to state action.” Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 8. Plaintiffs claim that: 
     Plaintiffs Smith and Park now include allegations that, among other 
     things: lethal attacks against women have escalated since the RHA, 
     the Bail Reform Law, and other policies were put in place by New 
     York; that the release of these offenders under New York’s recently-
     enacted Bail Reform law [that went into effect on January 1, 2020] 
     disproportionately impacts women; that Defendants knew or should 
     have known that the elimination of deterrence brought about by the 
     RHA, the decriminalization of killing of Medically-Viable Unborn 
     Children, New York’s Bail Reform Law and other policies are     
     reckless, unfounded and irrational, and serve only to remove an 
     important source of protection for women and Medically-Viable   
     Unborn Children.                                                

Id. at 8–9 (citation omitted).                                            
Defendants counter that “these additional allegations in the Post-Dobbs PAC do not 
undermine the Court’s conclusion that the enactment and notification of the RHA does not 
constitute a state-created danger within the meaning of that legal theory to sustain the due 
process claim in Count [One].” Defs.’ Resp. at 15 (citing Dismissal Order at 11–12). “Likewise, 
they do not undermine the Court’s conclusion that the inability to file specified criminal charges 
does not affect the constitutional right to legal redress alleged in Count [Two] or change the fact 
that other criminal charges are still available for the specified conduct.” Defs.’ Resp. at 15–16 
(citing Dismissal Order at 13–16).                                        
The Court agrees with Defendants. With respect to the newly stated Count One, which 
seeks to hold Defendants liable for allegedly creating threats of violence against Jane Smith, Jill 
Park, and other similarly situated women by enacting the RHA, the Bail Reform Law, and other 
related policies, Post-Dobbs PAC ¶¶ 263–68, Plaintiffs have still failed to demonstrate that 
“Defendants condoned violence against pregnant women,” Dismissal Order at 12. Plaintiffs have 
failed to provide the Court with any authority suggesting that the state-created danger exception 
under the Fourteenth Amendment is satisfied where state officials enact laws and policies that 

they subjectively believe advance the interests of the citizenry but the consequences of those 
laws have deleterious effects. See Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 8–9 (failing to provide 
any case law supporting Plaintiffs’ argument that these new allegations satisfy the state-created 
danger exception); see generally Dismissal Order at 11 (finding that “[t]he state-created danger 
exception requires some form of affirmative, rather than passive, conduct on the part of a 
government actor that communicates, explicitly or implicitly, official sanction of private 
violence” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiffs’ argument that Defendants “knew or 
should have known” of these negative consequences when enacting the RHA and New York’s 
Bail Reform Law is not nearly enough.                                     

As for Count Two, which seeks to hold Defendants liable for allegedly depriving Jane 
Smith, Jill Park, and other similarly situated women of their right to legal redress, by enacting 
the RHA, the Bail Reform Law, and other related policies, Post-Dobbs PAC ¶¶ 269–78, these 
new allegations also fail to cure the pleading deficiencies identified in the Original Complaint, 
Dismissal Order at 13–16. It remains the case that “a private citizen does not have a 
constitutional right to bring a criminal complaint against another individual.” Id. at 14. 
Moreover, in these new allegations, Plaintiffs have still failed to allege that they “experience[d] a 
. . . wholesale denial of judicial relief.” Id. at 16. Accordingly, allowing Plaintiffs to bring 
Counts One and Two in the Post-Dobbs PAC would be futile.                 
       2.  Counts Three, Four, and Five 
 Counts Three, Four, and Five in the Post-Dobbs PAC are broadly similar to Counts Three 
and Four in the Original Complaint, except the following differences should be noted: 
    e   Plaintiffs have proposed new “co-next friends” to represent the “Viable Unborn 
       Children” bringing Counts Three, Four, and Five in the Post-Dobbs PAC. 
       Compare Post-Dobbs PAC □□ 279-316, with Original Compl. {J 255-89. 
    e   Inthe Original Complaint, Count Three contained both substantive due process 
       and equal protection claims on behalf of “Viable Unborn Children,” Original 
       Compl. § 255, but in the Post-Dobbs PAC, Plaintiffs have separated them into two 
       separate counts, categorizing the substantive due process claims as Count Three, 
       Post-Dobbs PAC □□ 279-98, and the equal protection claims as Count Four, id. □□ 
       299-306. 
    e   Inthe Original Complaint, Count Four stated a “right to legal redress” claim on 
       behalf of “Viable Unborn Children,” Original Compl. 9] 279-89, which now 
       appears as Count Five in the Post-Dobbs PAC, Post-Dobbs PAC {§ 307-316. 
    e   With respect to the substantive due process claims that appear as Count Three in 
       the Post-Dobbs PAC, Plaintiffs have provided new legal arguments to support 
       them in light of Dobbs, 142 S. Ct. 2228. Compare Post-Dobbs PAC    280-82, 
       with Original Compl. {J 255-71. 
    e   However, the legal analysis in support of the equal protection and “right to legal 
       redress” claims (1.e., Counts Four and Five in the Post-Dobbs PAC) is 
       substantially similar to what appeared in the Original Complaint. Compare Post- 
       Dobbs PAC 4 299-316, with Original Compl. {fj 272-89. 

                                 22 

The Court previously dismissed the broadly similar claims brought on behalf of “Viable Unborn 
Children” for lack of Article III standing because the Court had previously “declined . . . two 
appointments to serve as next friend” for the “Viable Unborn Children” named in the Original 
Complaint. Dismissal Order at 16. Accordingly, to examine whether this threshold standing 
deficiency has been cured in the Post-Dobbs PAC, the Court must first examine the post-

judgment motions to appoint legal representatives or next friends pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 17(c)(2). See Dkt. Nos. 61-5 to -6.                       
To the extent Rachel Brown-Lee and Miriam Brown seek appointment as legal 
representatives or next friends under Rule 17(c)(2) for “all viable unborn children” affected by 
the RHA, Dkt. Nos. 61-5 to -6, the Court denies the motions. This broad request suffers from the 
same defect the Court identified in its August 9, 2021, Text Order denying Plaintiffs’ earlier 
request for next friend appointment under Rule 17(c)(2). Dkt. No. 51 (“agree[ing] with several 
other Courts of Appeal that have determine that a ‘significant relationship’ is required” for 
appointment under Rule 17(c)(2)). Nowhere in the motions do Rachel Brown-Lee and Miriam 

Brown plausibly allege a “significant relationship” with “all viable unborn children” affected by 
the RHA. See Dkt. Nos. 61-5 to -6. Therefore, their request to represent “all viable unborn 
children” as Plaintiffs to this action under Rule 17(c)(2) is denied.     
To the extent Rachel Brown-Lee and Miriam Brown seek appointment as legal 
representatives or next friends for Plaintiff “Baby Nicholas,” who in turn would represent the 
purported class of “Viable Unborn Children” affected by the RHA, Dkt. Nos. 61-5 to -6, the 
Court need not decide that request to resolve whether stating Counts Three, Four, and Five in the 
Post-Dobbs PAC would be futile. As Defendants correctly point out, Baby Nicholas is not named 
as Plaintiff in Counts Three, Four, and Five in the Post-Dobbs PAC. See Defs.’ Resp. at 16 n.6 
(“Although listed in the caption, no claims are alleged within the Post-Dobbs PAC on behalf of 
‘Baby Nicholas.’”). Even if the Court were to cure that pleading deficiency, Plaintiffs would still 
run into the problem of Article III standing with respect to these claims. 
“Demonstrating that the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct caused injury to the 
plaintiff h[im]self is . . . generally an essential component of Article III standing.” Mahon v. 

Ticor Title Ins. Co., 683 F.3d 59, 62 (2d Cir. 2012). The Supreme Court has “repeatedly 
reiterated that ‘threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact,’ and 
that ‘[a]llegations of possible future injury’ are not sufficient.” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 
568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) (citation omitted). Furthermore, “a plaintiff must demonstrate standing 
for each claim he seeks to press.” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 335 (2006). 
“Thus, with respect to each asserted claim, ‘[a] plaintiff must always have suffered a distinct and 
palpable injury to [her]self.’” Mahon, 683 F.3d at 64 (alterations and emphasis in original) 
(quoting Gladstone Realtors v. Vill. of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100 (1979)). “‘That a suit may be 
a class action . . . adds nothing to the [threshold] question of standing, for even named plaintiffs 

who represent a class must allege and show that they personally have been injured, not that 
injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and 
which they purport to represent.’” Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357 (1979) (quoting Simon v. 
E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 40 n.20 (1976)).                 
Here, the Post-Dobbs PAC is devoid of allegations that “Baby Nicholas” himself was 
deprived of his alleged substantive due process or equal protection rights by the RHA’s 
loosening of abortion restrictions in New York—the core harm alleged in the new Counts Three 
and Four. The very nature of this lawsuit suggests otherwise—that the permissibly of abortion 
under the RHA had no effect on “Baby Nicholas,” because Rachel Brown-Lee was determined to 
carry her pregnancy to term, and nothing mandated by the RHA forced her to choose otherwise.  
The Post-Dobbs PAC is also lacking in any allegations that “Baby Nicholas” was 
individually deprived of his “right to redress” by the RHA’s modification to Section 125.05 of 
New York’s Penal Law—the core harm alleged in the newly stated Count Five. Plaintiffs’ 

allegation that “Baby Nicholas” is therefore “subject to being killed at the hands of a harm-
causing individual and if killed ha[s] no right to redress for [his] murder,” Post-Dobbs PAC ¶ 31, 
is far too speculative to satisfy the requirements of Article III standing. See Clapper, 568 U.S. at 
409 (“reiterat[ing] that ‘threatened injury must be certainly impending to constitute injury in 
fact,’ and that ‘[a]llegations of possible future injury’ are not sufficient” (citation omitted)). 
In a final attempt to save the newly stated Counts Three, Four, and Five, Plaintiffs 
contend that other “viable unborn children,” apart from “Baby Nicholas,” have standing to 
pursue those counts, even in the absence of a Rule 17(c)(2) representative. The attorneys for 
Plaintiffs have even argued that they directly “represent . . . the minors comprising the . . . Viable 

Unborn Children Class.” Pl.’s Rules 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at at 20. But that argument is 
without merit, and borders on frivolousness. As noted in the Court’s September 2022 Order: 
     The federal courts do not allow for a representative free-for-all, 
     especially with respect to children or the unborn, precisely because 
     “[t]he exercise of judicial power . . . can so profoundly affect the 
     lives, liberty, and property of those to whom it extends,” Valley 
     Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of   
     Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 473 (1982), including those 
     who may give birth to such children. The decision to seek legal 
     redress on behalf of minors and others who lack capacity “is not to 
     be placed in the hands of concerned bystanders, who will use it 
     simply as a vehicle for the vindication of value interests.” Diamond 
     v. Charles, 476 U.S. 54, 62 (1986) (cleaned up).                
Sept. 2022 Order at 11–12. The Court reemphasizes that Plaintiffs’ attorneys should refrain from 
“making [such] broad and perfunctory claims about their representative capacity . . . .” Id. at 11. 
It is well-established that “[a] mere self-appointed volunteer cannot [unilaterally] usurp authority 
to bind anyone else by litigation,” including “persons unknown or unborn.” Wright & Miller, 
18A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Juris. § 4454 (3d ed.). Plaintiffs’ counsel should heed this warning before 

commencing any additional litigation in the federal courts where they claim to directly represent 
“viable unborn children” to which they have no significant relationship.2 
In sum, if the Court allowed for the filing of the Post-Dobbs PAC, the Court would 
eventually dismiss the newly stated Counts Three, Four, and Five for lack of Article III standing. 
Accordingly, allowing Plaintiffs to bring those claims in the Post-Dobbs PAC would be futile. 
     3.  Count Five                                                  
Plaintiffs have abandoned the claims brought on behalf of “Abortion Survivors” in the 
Post-Dobbs PAC and have reformulated Count Six as a challenge to three different terms of 
Section 2599-BB.1 of the New York Public Health Law. In the Original Complaint, Plaintiffs 

challenged only two terms: (1) “health care practitioner,” in that it lacked additional guidance on 

2 It should be noted that Plaintiffs filed their Post-Dobbs Motions—reasserting this theory of 
direct representation—before the Court issued the September 2022 Order. In their Reply, filed 
after the September 2022 Order, Plaintiffs “acknowledge the Court’s [September 2022] ruling 
with respect to th[is] issue.” Pl.’s Reply at 3 n.1. Their attorneys add that they genuinely 
“believed that they properly raised [their purported direct] legal representation of . . . Medically 
Viable Unborn Children” in their past papers. Id. While the Court appreciates Plaintiffs’ 
attorneys clarifying that they did not present this theory of direct representation to the Court in 
bad faith, the Court cautions them that when an opposing party brings a motion for Rule 11 
sanctions, “Rule 11 establishes an objective standard, intended to eliminate any ‘empty-head 
pure-heart’ justification for patently frivolous arguments.” Abdelhamid v. Altria Group, Inc., 515 
F. Supp. 2d 384, 392 n.31 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Simon DeBartolo Grp., L.P. v. Richard E. 
Jacobs Grp., Inc., 186 F.3d 157, 166 (2d Cir. 1999)). Cf. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 
86, 90 (2d Cir. 2003) (observing that when courts act sua sponte “to impose [Rule 11] sanctions 
upon attorneys,” they “must be reviewed with ‘particular stringency,’” and that “a finding of bad 
faith on the part of the attorney is essential to a finding of contempt”).  
who exactly is authorized to perform abortions, Original Compl. ¶ 332; and (2) “health,” in that 
it lacked additional guidance on when exactly an abortion after twenty-four weeks gestation 
would be “necessary to protect a patient’s . . . health,” id. ¶ 347. In the Post-Dobbs PAC, 
Plaintiffs maintain their challenge to those two terms, and newly challenge the “absence of fetal 
viability” term as unconstitutionally vague. Post-Dobbs PAC ¶ 334.        

In the previous Dismissal Order, the Court dismissed the void-for-vagueness claims on 
Article III standing grounds because “Plaintiff Dr. Moe [did] not sufficiently allege[] a concrete 
intention to violate the law.” Dismissal Order at 20. To remedy this in the Post-Dobbs PAC, 
Plaintiffs have added:                                                    
     a declaration from Dr. Moe that contains her concrete choice as to 
     which definition she would use when asked by clients the definition 
     of “health” for purposes of securing a post-24 week abortion. In 
     addition, Plaintiffs have added [Dr. Lopez as Plaintiff] who share[s] 
     Dr. Moe’s concern, and likewise have offered a concrete definition 
     of  “health,”  and  professional  assessment  of  measures  of  “fetal 
     viability,” and the clinical competencies of “healthcare providers” 
     to  perform  post-24  week  abortions.  Their  intended  actions 
     consistent  with  these  professional  judgments  subject  them  to 
     prosecution or adverse licensure actions by Defendants.         

Pl.’s Rule 60(b) & 15(a)(2) Mem. at 25–26 (internal citation omitted).    
While these additions address some of the standing concerns identified by the Court in its 
prior Dismissal Order, such as Plaintiffs’ initial failure to allege a more concrete intention to 
violate the challenged law, see Dismissal Order at 19–21, a key problem remains. Nothing in the 
Post-Dobbs PAC demonstrates that any enforcement of Public Health Law Section 2599-BB 
against Plaintiffs Moe or Lopez has been credibly threatened. As the Court previously stated, 
“[t]o sufficiently allege standing on [a] preenforcement claim, Plaintiff must therefore allege 
both a concrete intention to violate the law and the credible threat of prosecution if he were to do 
so.” Dismissal Order at 18–19 (emphasis added) (quoting Adam v. Barr, No. 18-CV-2106, 2019 
WL 1426991, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2019), aff’d, 792 Fed. App’x 20 (2d Cir. 2019), cert. 
denied, 140 S. Ct. 1119 (2020)). Plaintiffs’ allegation that “[d]uring the legislative debates 
preceding the passage of the RHA,” a “sponsor of the legislation” argued that medical 
professionals who were “confused by the text or did not understand his or her role under the 
RHA should be subjected to disciplinary charges and loss of license[]” is a far cry from a 

“credible threat of prosecution” by a state executive branch official after its passage. Post-Dobbs 
PAC ¶ 327.                                                                
Given the above, Plaintiffs would not have Article III standing to pursue the newly stated 
Count Six in the Post-Dobbs PAC. Allowing Plaintiffs to bring Count Six would therefore be 
futile. Accordingly, the Court denies the Rule 15(a)(2), Rule 59(e), and Rule 60(b)(6) motions 
insofar as Plaintiffs seek to reopen and vacate the Judgment to file the Post-Dobbs PAC. 
V.   CONCLUSION                                                           
Accordingly, it is hereby:                                           
ORDERED, that Plaintiffs’ Post-Dobbs Motions (Dkt. No. 80) are DENIED; and it is

ORDERED, that, insofar as Rachel Brown-Lee and Miriam Brown seek appointment as 
legal representatives or next friends for “all viable unborn children” affected by the RHA 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c)(2), their motions (Dkt. Nos. 61-5 to -6) are 
DENIED; and it is further

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE SMITH, et al., 
                        Plaintiffs, 
      -against-                                    5:21-CV-0035 (LEK/ATB) 
KATHY HOCHUL, as Governor of the 
State of New York, et al, 
                        Defendants. 

                   MEMORANDUM-DECISION AND ORDER 
1.     INTRODUCTION 
      Plaintiffs  Jane Smith, Jill Park, Mary Doe, Ann Jones, and Dr. Amy Moe commenced the 
present action, challenging certain amendments and provisions of the New York Reproductive 
Health Act (“RHA”). Dkt. No. 1 (“Complaint”). Simultaneously, Plaintiffs Doe and Jones each 
filed motions to be appointed as next friend under Rule 17(c)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Dkt. Nos. 2 (“Doe Motion”), 8 (“Jones Motion”). Presently before the Court is 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Complaint. Dkt. Nos. 35 (“Motion to Dismiss”); 35-1 
(“Defendants’ Memorandum”); 44 (“Response”); 47 (“Reply”). The Court has already denied the 
Doe Motion and Jones Motion. See Dkt. No. 51. 
      As the Supreme Court has observed, “[m]Jen and women of good conscience can disagree, 
and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications 
of terminating a pregnancy,” Planned Parenthood of Se. Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 
850, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2806, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992). Here, where the challenged law relates to 
termination of a pregnancy through violence against a pregnant person, few would disagree about 

the wrongfulness of such violence. However, profound disagreements still exist with regard to 
the most appropriate disincentives and punishments for such conduct. The democratically elected 
state government of New York has spoken on this issue and, absent a conflicting provision of 
federal law or of the United States Constitution, this Court may not intervene. 
     For the following reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Complaint is granted. 
II.     BACKGROUND 
     A.  Factual History 
     The following factual allegations are assumed to be true. See Vega v. Hempstead Union 
Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 76 (2d Cir. 2015). 
           I.  The Parties 
     Plaintiff  Jane Smith is an adult who resides in the Greater New York City area, and was 
in the early stages of pregnancy with her third child when she experienced intimate partner 
violence in late 2019. Compl. [J] 28, 71-72. On June 2, 2020, Plaintiff Smith gave birth to a male 
child. Id. {| 73. Plaintiff seeks to assert her own claims against Defendants, as well as those on 
behalf of two classes of women: (1) women who are subjected to a greater risk of violence as a 
result of the RHA’s repeal and amendment of the N.Y. Penal Law §125.00, 125.40 and 125.45 
(“Violence Against Women Class”); and (2) women who have experienced the murder or 
attempted murder of their viable unborn child and now have no legal recourse or redress for that 
crime as a result of the passage of the RHA’s repeal and amendment of the N.Y. Penal Law 
$125.00, 125.40 and 125.45 (“Women Lacking Recourse Class”). Id. ] 28. 
     Plaintiff Jill Park is an adult who resides in the Western New York area, and in late 2019 
and early 2020, she was pregnant with her first child when she experienced intimate partner

violence and threats from her partner’s family. Id.       On April 29, 2020, Plaintiff Park 
prematurely gave birth to a female child. Id. 7 91. She too is seeking to assert her claims against 
Defendants, as well as those on behalf of the Violence Against Women Class and Women 
Lacking Recourse Class. Id. J 29. 
     Plaintiff Mary Doe previously sought to be appointed as a legal representative, guardian 
ad litem, or next friend, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 17(c)(2), for the 
limited purposes of representing in this action viable unborn children who are (1) subject to 
being aborted due to Public Health Law §2599-BB.1; or (2) who are wanted, but killed at the 
hands of a harm-causing individual and have no right to redress for their murder (collectively, the 
“Viable Unborn Children Class”) as a result of the modification of Penal Law §125 by the RHA. 
Id. ¥ 30. 
     Plaintiff Ann Jones previously sought to be appointed as a legal representative, guardian 
ad litem, or next friend, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 17(c)(2), for the 
limited purposes of representing in this action children who survive abortion (“Abortion 
Survivors Class”). Id.  J 31. 
     Plaintiff Dr. Amy Moe is a physician licensed since 1989 to practice medicine in the State 
of New York. Id. ¥ 32. Plaintiff Dr. Moe is asserting her own claims, and also seeks to represent 
similarly situated physicians in this action (the “Physician Class”) who are unable to fulfill their 
legal and professional obligation to inform and counsel pregnant patients regarding what medical 
circumstances allow post-viability abortions, and what healthcare professionals are authorized to 
provide such abortions. Id.

     Originally, then-Governor Andrew Cuomo was listed as a defendant. Id. 4 33. However, 
Defendant Governor Kathy Hochul, the current Governor of the State of New York, was 
automatically substituted as a party pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 25. 
     Defendant Letitia  James is the Attorney General of the State of New York. Id. ¥ 34. 
Defendant Howard A. Zucker is the Commissioner of Health for New York State. Id. J 35. 
Defendant Deirdre Astin is Deputy Director, Division of Hospitals and Diagnostic and Treatment 
Centers, New York State Department of Health. Id.   36. Defendant Deputy Commissioner Sarah 
Benson directs the Office of Professional Discipline at the New York State Department of 
Education. Id.   37. Defendant Arthur S. Hengerer is the Chair of the New York State 
Department of Health Office of Professional Medical Conduct. Id. ] 38. Defendant Donna 
Frescatore serves as the New York Medicaid Director. Id. ¥ 39. Finally, Defendant Sheila J. 
Poole is the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services. Id. | 
40. 
           2.  New York Reproductive Health Act 
     In January 2019, the Governor of New York State signed the RHA into law. Id. J 47. 
Among many other things, the RHA added Article 25-A of the Public Health Law and 
decriminalized abortion. Id. {J 48-66. 
     Article 25-A specifically states the following: 
          N.Y. Public Health Law § 2599-AA Policy and purpose. 
           The legislature finds that comprehensive reproductive health care is 
           a fundamental component of every individual’s health, privacy and 
           equality. Therefore, it is the policy of the state that:

           1. Every individual has the fundamental right to choose or refuse 
           contraception or sterilization. 
           2. Every individual who becomes pregnant has the fundamental right 
           to choose to carry the pregnancy to term, to give birth to a child, or to 
           have an abortion, pursuant to this article. 
           3. The state shall not discriminate against, deny, or interfere with the 
           exercise of the rights set forth in this section in the regulation or 
           provision of benefits, facilities, services or information. 
          N.Y. Public Health Law § 2599-BB. Abortion 
           1. A health care practitioner licensed, certified, or authorized under 
           title eight of the education law, acting within his or her lawful scope 
           of practice,  may  perform  an  abortion  when,  according  to  the 
           practitioner’s reasonable and good faith professional judgment based 
           on the facts of the patient’s case: the patient is within twenty-four 
           weeks from the commencement of pregnancy, or there is an absence 
           of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s 
           life or health. 
           2. This article shall be construed and applied consistent with and 
           subject to applicable laws and applicable and authorized regulations 
           governing health care procedures. 
Id. | 48 (citations omitted). 
     Furthermore, the RHA eliminated abortion as a crime and removed from the homicide 
statutes the qualifying act of causing the death of “an unborn child with which a female has been 
pregnant for more than twenty-four weeks.” Id. |] 50-51 (citing N.Y. Penal Law §§ 125.00, 
125.05). 
I.    LEGAL STANDARD 
     A.  Rule 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss 
     When a defendant “moves for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1), as well as on other grounds, 
the court should consider the Rule 12(b)(1) challenge first since if it must dismiss the complaint

for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the accompanying defenses and objections become moot 
and do not need to be determined.” United States ex rel. Kreindler & Kreindler v. United Tech. 
Corp., 985 F.2d 1148, 1155-56 (2d Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
“A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) when 
the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.” Makarova v. United 
States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000). “To survive a defendant's Rule 12(b)(1) motion to 
dismiss for lack of standing, plaintiffs must allege facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest 
that [they have] standing to sue.” Kiryas Joel Alliance v. Village of Kiryas Joel, 495 F. App’x 
183, 188 (2d Cir. 2012) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In considering 
a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), a court must accept as true all material factual 
allegations in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs. Buday v. 
N.Y. Yankees P’Ship, 486 F. App’x 894, 896 (2d Cir. 2012). Plaintiffs, as the parties asserting 
subject matter jurisdiction, bear the burden of establishing their standing as the proper parties to 
bring this action. See Garanti Finansal Kiralama A.S. v. Aqua Marine & Trading, Inc., 697 F.3d 
59, 65 (2d Cir. 2012). 
      B.  Article III Standing 
      Standing is an “essential aspect” of the limits of federal judicial power under Article III of 
the Constitution, which authorizes federal courts to decide only actual “Cases” or 
“Controversies.” Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 704 (2013). To have standing to invoke 
the power of a federal court, a litigant must prove that: (1) she “has suffered a concrete and 
particularized injury”; (2) the injury “is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct”; and (3) the 
injury “is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” Id. (citing Lujan v. Defenders

of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)); see also Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (describing these 
three elements as “the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing”). “To have standing, a 
litigant must seek relief for an injury that affects him in a personal and individual way. He must 
possess a direct stake in the outcome of the case.” Hollingsworth, 570 U.S. at 705 (citations and 
quotation marks omitted). A litigant “raising only a generally available grievance about 
government-claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper application of the 
Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it 
does the public at large-does not state an Article III case or controversy.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 
573-74. In the class action context, the Second Circuit has noted that “only one of the named 
Plaintiffs is required to establish standing in order to seek relief on behalf of the entire class.” 
Cent. States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., 
504 F.3d 229, 241 (2d Cir. 2007). 
     C.  Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss 
     To survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a 
“complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that 
is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. 
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  A court must accept as 
true the factual allegations contained in a complaint and draw all inferences in favor of a 
plaintiff. See Allaire Corp. v. Okumus, 433 F.3d 248, 249-50 (2d Cir. 2006).  A complaint may 
be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) only where it appears that there are not “enough facts to 
state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. Plausibility 
requires “enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of

[the alleged misconduct].” Id. at 556. The plausibility standard “asks for more than a sheer 
possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 
US. at 556). “[T]he pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require ‘detailed factual 
allegations,’ but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me 
accusation.” Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Where a court is unable to infer more than 
the mere possibility of the alleged misconduct based on the pleaded facts, the pleader has not 
demonstrated that she is entitled to relief and the action is subject to dismissal. See id. at 678-79. 
IV.    DISCUSSION 
     A.  First Cause of Action - Substantive Due Process Claim 
     Plaintiffs Smith and Park allege that Penal Law § 125.05, as amended by the RHA, 
violates their, and the Violence Against Women and Women Lacking Recourse Classes’ 
substantive due process right to freedom from state-created threats of violence guaranteed by the 
Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Compl. 7 243. 
           I.  Plaintiffs Smith’s and Park’s Standing 
     Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge Penal Law § 125.05 because 
they have not suffered an injury in fact, Defs.” Mem. at 9, while Plaintiffs disagree, Resp. at 1-7. 
Defendants’ main contention is that Plaintiffs are making a pre-enforcement challenge to a 
criminal statute, without alleging fear of a criminal prosecution. Defs.” Mem. at 10. The Court 
disagrees with Defendants and denies the Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. 
     Defendants’ reliance on Cayuga Nation v. Tanner, 824 F.3d 321 (2d Cir. 2016) is 
misplaced. “When a plaintiff ‘has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably 
affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible

threat of prosecution thereunder, he should not be required to await and undergo a criminal 
prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.’” Cayuga Nation v. Tanner, 824 F.3d 321, 331 
(2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’! Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)). 
If the State of New York decided to criminalize abortions and Plaintiffs wanted to have 
abortions, then Cayuga Nation would be applicable. However, Cayuga Nation is not applicable 
where the State decriminalized an action, and Plaintiffs are looking to challenge the 
decriminalization. 
     Instead, the present situation is analogous to parties challenging administrative actions 
that decriminalize conduct that causes injury to the parties. See Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 
755 F.3d 1010, 1017 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“It is well-established that standing will lie where a 
plaintiff demonstrates that the challenged agency action authorizes the conduct that allegedly 
caused the plaintiff's injuries, if that conduct would allegedly be illegal otherwise. . . .”) (internal 
quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted). In Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t 
of the Interior, 397 F. Supp. 3d 430, 440 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), plaintiff States were challenging an 
opinion by the Department of Interior that decriminalized the incidental killing of migratory 
birds. The court there found an injury was present because “the lower the potential cost of 
incidentally killing a migratory bird, the more likely private actors are to weigh the pros and cons 
of activities in which they wish to engage that incidentally kill migratory birds in favor of 
engaging in those activities.” Id. 
     Here, Plaintiffs do sufficiently allege that they were victimized while pregnant. Compl. [J 
28-29, 71, 90. The RHA eliminated criminal penalties for abortions, which may have made it 
more likely for potential wrongdoers to weigh the pros and cons of their actions in favor of

engaging in violence. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 397 F. Supp. 3d at 440. In other words, at this 
stage of the case, the logic follows that the RHA reduced disincentives for violence against 
pregnant women. Finally, it makes no difference in this case that the named Plaintiffs were able 
to give birth. Were it not for the RHA, the violence Plaintiffs experienced could have potentially 
been charged as an attempt crime. See, e.g., In re Mercedes K., 933 N.Y.S.2d 691, 693 (2nd 
Dep’t 2011) (“attempted abortion in the second degree is legally cognizable.”). As such, the 
Court does not find that the injury Plaintiffs allege is merely hypothetical. Plaintiffs have 
sufficiently alleged that they suffered an injury-in-fact because of Defendants’ repeal of New 
York’s fetal homicide law. 
     Although Defendants do not argue traceability and redressability, the Court finds that they 
too are met. At the pleading stage, Plaintiffs’ burden is to allege facts “showing that third parties 
will likely react in predictable ways” to the RHA’s elimination of criminal penalties. See Dep’t 
of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). It is well-settled that “[fJor standing 
purposes, petitioners need not prove a cause-and-effect relationship with absolute certainty; 
substantial likelihood of the alleged causality meets the test.” Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Nat’l 
Highway Traffic Safety Admin., 894 F.3d 95, 104 (2d Cir. 2018) (citing Competitive Enter. Inst. 
v. NHTSA, 901 F.2d 107, 113 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). Taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, there is a 
“substantial likelihood” that by eliminating the fetal homicide law, the RHA reduced 
disincentives for violence against pregnant women, making it more likely that third parties will 
inflict violence against pregnant women. Finally, redressability is met because it is plausible that 
declaring the RHA’s various changes to N.Y. Penal Law § 125 to be unlawful would reduce that 
risk. 

                                     10 

            2.  Failure to State a Claim 
      The Due Process Clause provides, “[N]o State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, 
or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. “The Clause is phrased as 
a limitation on the State’s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and 
security.” DeShaney v. Winnebago Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 195 (1989). “[I]n 
certain limited circumstances[, however,] the Constitution imposes upon the State affirmative 
duties of care and protection with respect to particular individuals.” Id. at 198. One of these 
circumstances, which the Second Circuit has recognized, is the state-created danger exception. 
See Okin v. Vill. of Cornwall-On-Hudson Police Dep’t, 577 F.3d 415, 428 (2d Cir. 2009) (“the 
Due Process Clause may be violated when police officers’affirmative conduct—as opposed to 
passive failures to act—creates or increases the risk of private violence, and thereby enhances the 
danger to the victim.”) (emphasis in original). “The state-created danger exception requires some 
form of affirmative, rather than passive, conduct on the part of a government actor that 
‘communicates, explicitly or implicitly, official sanction of private violence.’” Tufaro v. City of 
New York, No. 12-CV-7505, 2014 WL 4290631, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2014) (quoting Okin, 
577 F.3d at 429). “Such communication is, in fact, a necessary prerequisite to condoning such 
conduct.” Bunn v. City of Poughkeepsie, No. 10-CV-2297, 2012 WL 1621563, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 
May 9, 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the Second Circuit has limited 
application of this doctrine to situations where “a third party’s criminal behavior harmed the 
plaintiff after a government actor—always a law enforcement officer—enhanced or created the 
opportunity for the criminal act through some interaction or relationship with the wrongdoer.” 

                                      11 

Lombardi v. Whitman, 485 F.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir. 2007); see also Leder v. Am. Traffic Sols., Inc., 
630 F. App’x 61, 63 (2d Cir. 2015). 
     The Court begins by recognizing that there is no clear line between “affirmative” and 
“passive” conduct. See Pena v. DePrisco, 432 F.3d 98, 109-10 (2d Cir. 2005). Here, however, 
the Court easily finds that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege that Defendants’ actions fall 
under the ambit of this state-created danger exception. Specifically, there is nothing in the 
Complaint alleging that any of the Defendants communicated an official sanction of private 
violence. In their Response, Plaintiffs point to the fact that the RHA was widely publicized by 
state officials and the former Governor directed all of New York’s landmarks to be lit in pink to 
celebrate the RHA. Resp. at 5. The Court, however does not find this to amount to affirmative 
conduct because there was no “interaction or relationship with the wrongdoer.” Lombardi, 485 
F.3d at 80; see also Bunn, 2012 WL 1621563, at *5 (“Here, however, there is neither an 
allegation nor evidence that the police condoned [wrongdoer’s] behavior, or had any 
communication with [wrongdoer] whatsoever between the time the order of protection was 
issued and the time that [victim] was shot’); see also Coleman v. Cty. of Suffolk, 174 F. Supp. 
3d 747, 766 (E.D.N.Y. 2016), aff'd, 685 F. App’x 69 (2d Cir. 2017) (“The Court cannot infer 
that the police communicated a condoning of [wrongdoer’s] conduct where ‘[p]laintiff] ] offer[s] 
no evidence to support the notion that [wrongdoer] was aware of the officers’ comments or that 
he ‘inferred from [them] a green light to escalate’ his actions. ...”). In addition, Plaintiffs fail to 
allege that the Defendants condoned violence against pregnant women. Without anything more, a 
state official who publicizes a legislative victory to the general public does not engage in the type 

                                     12 

of action that falls under the ambit of this state-created danger exception. Thus, the motion to 
dismiss is granted with respect to Count I. 
     B.  Second Cause of Action - Right to Legal Redress 
    Next, Plaintiffs Smith and Park allege that Penal Law § 125.05, as amended by the RHA, 
violates their, and the Women Lacking Recourse Classes’ First Amendment right to legal redress. 
Compl. §[§] 244-254. 
           1.  Plaintiffs Smith and Park’s Standing 
     For largely the same reasons as explained in section IV(A)(1), Smith and Park have 
established standing, and Defendants’ 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss is denied. 
           2.  Failure to State a Claim 
     The First Amendment provides, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the 
press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a 
redress of grievances.” U.S. Const. amend. I (emphasis added). “The Supreme Court has 
described the right to petition government for redress of grievances as ‘among the most precious 
of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights.’” Franco v. Kelly, 854 F.2d 584, 589 (2d Cir. 
1988) (quoting United Mine Workers v. Ill. State Bar Ass’n, 389 U.S. 217, 222 (1967)). 
However, the right to petition is limited to situations where a plaintiff “was somehow denied the 
opportunity to redress a constitutional violation at the hands of a governmental official.” Price v. 
Hasly, No. 04-CV-0090S, 2004 WL 1305744, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. June 8, 2004). Plaintiffs’ claim is 
that the RHA prevents prosecutors and courts from “from punishing violent acts that kill a viable 
unborn child.” Compl. 4] 244-254. This is similar to cases where a plaintiff is prevented from 

                                     13 

filing criminal charges. See Price, 2004 WL 1305744, at *2 (“[H]is claim is that [he] was 
somehow prevented from filing criminal charges against another inmate who allegedly assaulted 
him. This claim is simply not actionable because it is well-settled that a private citizen does not 
have a constitutional right to bring a criminal complaint against another individual.”) (citing 
Leeke v. Timmerman, 454 U.S. 83 (1981)); see also Chandler v. Carroll, No. 11-CV-108, 2011 
WL 5419770, at *6 (D. Vt. Nov. 9, 2011) (finding that there was no constitutional violation 
where plaintiff accused defendant “of denying him his right to petition the government for 
redress in the form of a criminal complaint.”). Under the First Amendment, the Court sees no 
difference between a  state official preventing the filing of criminal charges and the absence of a 
state law authorizing such criminal charges. In neither case is the First Amendment violated 
because a private citizen does not have a constitutional right to bring a criminal complaint 
against another individual. 
     Instead, Plaintiffs argue that the present case is similar to Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 
(1996). Resp. at 18-19. Specifically, “[i]n eliminating this protection, like Colorado voters in 
Romer, Defendants have made it impossible to criminally punish those who deprive mothers of 
the care and custody of their children by killing the children, and deprive the children of their 
very lives.” Id. at 19. In Romer, in response to Colorado municipalities passing ordinances to 
prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, Colorado voters adopted an 
amendment to the state constitution via a referendum that “prohibit[ed] all legislative, executive 
or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect the named class, a 
class we shall refer to as homosexual persons or gays and lesbians.” 517 U.S. at 624. The 
Supreme Court invalidated the amendment under the Equal Protection Clause because it made 

                                     14 

gay individuals “unequal to everyone else” by “imposing a broad and undifferentiated disability 
on a single named group.” Id. at 632, 635. 
      Although Plaintiffs acknowledge that Romer was an equal protection case, they seek to 
apply its rationale by arguing “that a part of the violation of plaintiffs’ rights is the denial of 
Judicial relief for any harms suffered.” Resp. at 19. Defendants disagree, contending that even if 
Romer is applicable here, there are still criminal laws that can protect Plaintiffs and nothing 
prevents Plaintiffs from lobbying the Legislature to amend the RHA. Reply at 8. 
      The Court finds Romer inapplicable in the context of a right to redress claim. Plaintiffs 
have not provided any case law support for their novel theory. Moreover, the Court does not find 
the present situation analogous to Romer. It is true that under prior state law “a criminal assailant 
could be charged with the murder of an unborn child with whom a woman had been pregnant for 
more than twenty-four weeks.” Compl. 4 58. Now that the RHA eliminated criminal penalties for 
abortion crimes, Plaintiffs have lost that particular legal protection. See, e.g., State v. Etchison, 
188 Neb. 134, 137 (1972) (“The primary function of the criminal law is to protect individuals 
and society from the depredations of the criminally bent.”); United States v. Mancuso, 420 F.2d 
556, 559 (2d Cir. 1970) (“The primary purpose of law, and the criminal law in particular, is to 
conform conduct to the norms expressed in that law.”). Plaintiffs argue that they experienced a 
denial of judicial relief for any harms suffered. Resp. at 19. However, pregnant mothers are still 
protected under other criminal statutes (e.g., homicide and assault) that still provide a deterrent 
effect. Specifically, in the stories that Plaintiffs cite to in their Complaint, the wrongdoers were 
convicted of other criminal murder or assault charges besides under the then-fetal homicide law, 
and after the RHA went into effect, wrongdoers still face these other criminal charges. Compl. | 

                                      15 

236. It is not accurate to say, as Plaintiff claims, that the RHA “made it impossible to criminally 
punish those who deprive mothers of the care and custody of their children by killing the 
children[.]” Resp. at 19.' 
      In Romer, the amendment “prohibit[ed] all legislative, executive or judicial action at any 
level of state or local government designed to protect the named class.” 517 U.S. at 624. This is 
not the case here. Plaintiffs did not experience a similar wholesale denial of judicial relief. 
Criminal charges have been brought and are still brought against assailants who attack pregnant 
women. Furthermore, nothing prevents Plaintiffs from lobbying the state legislature to repeal the 
RHA. Thus, Romer is not applicable and Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for their right to 
redress claim. 
      C.  Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Causes of Action 
      The Court can easily dispense with the next four causes of action. They each depend on 
next friend standing for Plaintiffs Mary Doe and Ann Jones. See Compl. {fj 255, 279, 290, 298. 
However, the Court has already declined the two appointments to serve as next friend. See Dkt. 
No. 51. Thus, Mary Doe and Ann Jones lack standing to proceed in this Court. See Whitmore v. 
Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 163-66 (1990). Accordingly, Defendant’s 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss is 
granted with respect to Counts III, IV, V, and IV. 

      '  Plaintiffs also state that the RHA made it impossible to criminally punish those who 
“deprive the [viable unborn] children of their very lives.” Resp. at 19. The Court finds this a 
troubling allegation. However, this allegation is relevant to Plaintiffs’ Fourth Cause of Action, 
which addresses legal redress for the Viable Unborn Children Class, Compl. at 66, and not 
Plaintiffs’ Second Cause of Action, which addresses legal redress for Plaintiffs  Jane Smith, Jill 
Park, and the Women Lacking Recourse Class, id. at 58. Plaintiffs’ Fourth Cause of Action is 
dismissed for lack of standing. Infra Section IV(C). 
                                      16 

      D.  Seventh Cause of Action - Void for Vagueness 
      Finally, Plaintiff Dr. Amy Moe, on behalf of herself and the Physician Class, allege that 
two terms of Section 2599-BB.1 of New York Public Health Law are void for undue vagueness. 
Compl. §[f[ 319-352. 
            1.  Plaintiff Moe’s Standing 
      After the parties submitted their original briefing, the Supreme Court issued California v. 
Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104 (2021), which found that parties did not have standing to attack an 
unenforceable statutory provision. Since both parties agreed that the RHA does not have an 
enforcement mechanism, the Court instructed the parties to file supplemental briefing addressing 
how California v. Texas applies to the standing of Dr. Moe and the Physician Class. See Dkt. 
Nos. 50; 52 (“Plaintiffs’ Sur-Reply”); 53 (“Defendants’ Response to Plaintiffs’ Sur-Reply”). 
      Upon reviewing the parties’ briefing, the Court finds that the facts present are not similar 
to California. In California, the plaintiffs could not “point[] to any way in which the defendants, 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will act 
to enforce [the statutory provision].” 141 S. Ct. at 2114. Since the plaintiffs could not show “how 
any other federal employees could do so either[,]” “they have not shown that any kind of 
Government action or conduct has caused or will cause the injury they attribute to [the statutory 
provision].” Id. The unenforceable statutory language alone was not sufficient to establish 
standing. Id. at 2115. The Supreme Court concluded that “the plaintiffs in this suit failed to show 
a concrete, particularized injury fairly traceable to the defendants’ conduct in enforcing the 
specific statutory provision they attack as unconstitutional.” Id. at 2120. 

                                      17 

     By contrast, Plaintiffs here sufficiently show that Government action will cause such 
injury attributable to Section 2599-BB.1 of New York Public Health Law. In their Complaint, 
Plaintiff Dr. Moe alleges that Section 2599-BB.1 “subjects her to professional and criminal 
sanctions[.]” Compl. § 329; see also id. § 327 (citing N.Y. Penal Law §§ 240.70, 240.71, 240.72, 
240.73) and § 328 (“Plaintiff Dr. Moe must practice medicine consistent with all other regulatory 
and legal or licensure requirements”). Defendants argue that “the harms alleged by Dr. Moe do 
not result from the operation or enforcement of the challenged statute.” Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Sur- 
Reply at 3. The Court disagrees. Notably, Section 2599-BB.2 provides that “[t]his article [the 
RHA] shall be construed and applied consistent with and subject to applicable laws and 
applicable and authorized regulations governing health care procedures.” N.Y. Pub. Health Law 
§ 2599-BB. Unlike in California, Section 2599-BB.1 is not just unenforceable statutory language. 
Section 2599-BB.2 makes clear that the RHA (which includes Section 2599-BB.1) will be 
implemented consistent with applicable laws and regulations governing health care procedure. 
Even without a specific enforcement mechanism in the statute, it is plausible to construe Section 
2599-BB.2 as allowing Defendants to enforce Section 2599-BB.1 through either civil or criminal 
law. 
     Although California does not apply here, the Court ultimately finds that Plaintiff Dr. Moe 
lacks standing. “When a  plaintiff ‘has alleged an intention to engage in a course of conduct 
arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a 
credible threat of prosecution thereunder, he should not be required to await and undergo a 
criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.’” Cayuga Nation, 824 F.3d at 331 
(quoting Babbitt, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)). “To sufficiently allege standing on his 

                                     18 

preenforcement claim, Plaintiff must therefore allege both a concrete intention to violate the law 
and the credible threat of prosecution if he were to do so.” Adam v. Barr, No. 18-CV-2106, 2019 
WL 1426991, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2019), aff'd, 792 F. App’x 20 (2d Cir. 2019), cert. 
denied, 140 S. Ct. 1119, 206 L. Ed. 2d 186 (2020). 
      The first term of Section 2599-BB.1 of New York Public Health Law that Plaintiff Dr. 
Moe identifies as ambiguous is “health care practitioner.” Compl.  7 295. Plaintiff Dr. Moe 
alleges that the RHA authorizes a “health care practitioner” to perform abortions, but that there is 
no definition of “health care practitioner.” Id. {J 332-33. As a result of this failure to define who 
is authorized to perform abortions, she is “unsure as to how to respond to her patients’ questions 
or concerns about the qualifications or competency of any particular abortion provider or 
facility[.]” Id.   337. Accordingly, RHA “impeded her ability to fully and appropriately answer 
patient questions, address patient concerns, or provide full and complete assessments on 
post-abortive women.” Id. ¥ 339. 
      The second term of Section 2599-BB.1 of New York Public Health Law, Plaintiff Dr. 
Moe identifies as ambiguous is “necessary to protect a patient’s life or health.” Id. J 156. 
Specifically, she alleges that the law fails to define the circumstances under which an abortion 
after twenty-four weeks would be “necessary to protection a patient’s life or health.” Id. §] 347. 
Neither the RHA or the Public Health Law defines “health.” Id.   348. Plaintiff Dr. Moe points to 
at least three possible definitions of “necessary to protect the patient’s .. . health” and her “ability 
to fully and appropriately answer her patients’ questions or address their concerns is hampered by 
the lack of clarity of the RHA.” Id.    349-50. 

                                      19 

      Here, Plaintiff Dr. Moe has not sufficiently alleged a concrete intention to violate the law. 
Notably, Dr. Moe does not allege “‘concrete plans’ to perform, in the near future, the conduct 
that officials would consider illegal.” Jones v. Schneiderman, 101 F. Supp. 3d 283, 291 
(S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564). Instead, a fair reading of the allegations is that 
the RHA is confusing and Dr. Moe cannot accurately answer questions presented by her patients. 
Being unsure is not the same as articulating a concrete plan. See Kearns v. Cuomo, 415 F. Supp. 
3d 319, 329 (W.D.N.Y. 2019), aff'd, 981 F.3d 200 (2d Cir. 2020) (collecting cases on the 
concrete plan requirement). There is nothing to indicate that Dr. Moe intended to follow a 
specific definition of “health care practitioner” that could violate the RHA. In other words, Dr. 
Moe has provided the Court with no information at all regarding her intentions now that the RHA 
has gone into effect. Id. at 330. Additionally, Dr. Moe provided three possible definitions of 
“necessary to protect the patient’s .. . health,” but she has not articulated which definition she 
intended to follow or how it could be considered illegal. Dr. Moe’s confusion and uncertainty on 
how to proceed is understandable’, but to demonstrate standing, she must show some concrete 
intention on her part to violate civil or criminal laws.

482, 488 n.1 (N.D.N.Y. 2020) (taking judicial notice of  a NYS government website) (Kahn, J.). 
This guidance may provide many of the answers that Dr. Moe is seeking, and may potentially 
moot her claims. 
                                      20 

     Because the Court finds that Plaintiff Dr. Moe failed to allege a concrete intention to 
violate the law, the Court need not determine whether there was a credible threat of prosecution. 
Thus, Dr. Moe has failed to meet her burden to establish standing for Counts VII(A) and VII(B). 
V.     CONCLUSION 
     Termination of pregnancy is a deeply fraught and contested issue, and few can doubt the 
wrongfulness of terminating a pregnancy through violence against a pregnant person. Here, the 
state legislature has chosen to forgo a particular approach to punishing such wrongful conduct, 
and it is not a court’s role to substitute its moral judgements for those of the legislature. 
     Accordingly, it is hereby: 
     ORDERED, that the Motion to Dismiss under 12(b)(1) (Dkt. No. 35) is GRANTED in 
part and DENIED in part. The motion is GRANTED as to Plaintiffs Mary Doe, Ann Jones, 
and Dr. Amy Moe. The motion is DENIED as to Plaintiffs  Jane Smith and Jill Park; and it is 
further 
     ORDERED, that the Motion to Dismiss under 12(b)(6) (Dkt. No. 35) against Plaintiffs 
Jane Smith and Jill Park is GRANTED; and it is further 
     ORDERED, that the Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) is DISMISSED; and it is further 
     ORDERED, that the Clerk is directed to close this action; and it is further 
     ORDERED, that the Clerk of the Court serve a copy of this Memorandum-Decision and 
Order on all parties in accordance with the Local Rules. 

                                     21 

     IT ISSO ORDERED.
