outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Cultural Care, Inc.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in denying its motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the New York Convention based on the arbitration agreement in the ICL Contract signed by the plaintiffs.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court wrongly concluded that Cultural Care, as a nonsignatory, could not enforce the arbitration agreement in the ICL Contract under either federal common law or Swiss law.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred by not sending the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator, asserting that the ICL Contract contained a delegation clause requiring arbitrability disputes to be decided by the arbitrator.

  4. Appellant claimed that it was entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement as a third-party beneficiary of the ICL Contract, based on various provisions in the contract and its status as an affiliate referenced in the release clause.

  5. Appellant asserted that the district court improperly focused on whether Cultural Care was a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration provision itself, rather than the contract as a whole.

  6. Appellant contended that the district court''s approach improperly discriminated against arbitration by imposing a higher standard for third-party enforcement of arbitration clauses than for forum-selection clauses.

  7. Appellant argued that, in the alternative, it was entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement under the doctrine of equitable estoppel because the plaintiffs'' claims were sufficiently intertwined with the ICL Contract.'
