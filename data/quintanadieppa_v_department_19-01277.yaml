reason_for_appeal: '=== Carmen Quintana-Dieppa''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in finding she failed to properly contest the Army''s Statement of Facts and in construing the summary judgment record against her.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court improperly disregarded her Statement of Additional Facts, which she claimed included material factual disputes supported by record citations.

  3. Appellant asserted that the district court acted as a factfinder, rather than properly applying the summary judgment standard, by accepting the Army''s facts as uncontroverted.

  4. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her claims of sex and race discrimination under Title VII, age discrimination under the ADEA, and retaliation under Title VII, because there were genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether her reassignment was discriminatory or retaliatory.

  5. Appellant claimed that the Army''s stated reasons for her reassignment were pretextual, asserting that the investigation reports were based on inadmissible hearsay, were fabricated, and that the Army failed to follow its own recommendations for less severe discipline.

  6. Appellant argued that the district court failed to recognize that her reassignment was temporally proximate to her supervisors learning of her EEOC complaint, supporting her retaliation claim.

  7. Appellant contended that the district court erred by not considering evidence that her position was first offered to a younger male employee, which she claimed supported her discrimination claims.

  8. Appellant asserted that the district court should not have disregarded her additional factual submissions based on formatting or procedural grounds, and that any deficiencies did not justify ignoring her evidence.'
