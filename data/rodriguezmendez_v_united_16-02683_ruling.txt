                     OPINION AND ORDER                                

    This is an action for federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, in 
which petitioner Julio A. Rodríguez-Méndez (“Rodríguez-Méndez”) requests 
for  the  Court  to  vacate  his  conviction  under  Armed  Career  Criminal  Act 
(“ACCA”).  Docket No. 1.  Pending before the Court is petitioner’s challenge 
to his conviction based on Johnson v. United States, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (2015) 
(“Johnson II”).  See Docket Nos. 8, 11 and 12.  Also pending is petitioner’s 
motion to reconsider the dismissal of his Double Jeopardy claim (Docket 
No. 24).    For  the  reasons  stated  below,  Rodríguez-Méndez’s  petition  for 
federal habeas relief and motion to reconsider are DENIED.             
I.  BACKGROUND                                                        
    Petitioner  Rodríguez-Méndez  was  sentenced  to  216  months  of 

imprisonment after pleading guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), felon in 
possession  of  a  firearm.  Docket  No. 12  (citing  Docket  No. 54  in 
Related Criminal 05-0340(CCC)                                          


Criminal 05-0340).    On  September  20,  2016,  Rodríguez-Méndez  filed  a 
petition for federal habeas relief (Docket No. 1).1  On September 30, 2019, 
this Court dismissed, with prejudice, Julio A. Rodríguez-Méndez’s Double 
Jeopardy claim.  Id. at 13.  Not being able to make an informed, proper and 
just determination on the Johnson II claim, the Court ordered the parties to file 
detailed  briefs  regarding  the  Johnson II  claim,  along  with  duly  translated 
official Puerto Rico court documents.  Id. at 12.  The parties complied with 
the Courts order by filing said documents.  See Docket Nos. 23 and 24. 

II.  MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION                                       
    Along with its motion in compliance to the Court’s order at Docket Entry 
No. 12,  petitioner  Rodríguez-Méndez  filed  a  motion  asking  the  Court  to 
reconsider its past ruling dismissing the Double Jeopardy claim pursuant to 

Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, 136 S.Ct. 1863 (2016).  Docket No. 24 at 3. 
First,  Rodríguez-Méndez  submits  that  the  Court  incorrectly  used  the 
January 25, 2019 date, the date of the final judgment of conviction, as the 

triggering  date  to  find  his  federal  habeas  relief  under  28 U.S.C.  § 2255 
time-barred.  Id. at 4.  According to Rodríguez-Méndez, the Court should 


    1The Court will not provide an extensive discussion of the facts as they were provided in the 
Opinion and Order filed by this Court on September 30, 2019.  See Docket No. 12 at 1-4. 
Related Criminal 05-0340(CCC)                                          


have used the date of June 9, 2016, as the correct triggering date, because it 
was  the  date  when   Sanchez   Valle  was  decided.  Id.  Second,    
Rodríguez-Méndez submits that the Court erred by dismissing the Double 
Jeopardy claim for lack of privity, pursuant to United States v. Santana-Rios, 
No. 17-1107.  Id. at 7.                                                
    On reconsideration, the Court finds Rodríguez-Méndez’s arguments to 
be without merit and DENIES petitioner’s motion for reconsideration on the 
same grounds of the Opinion and Order at Docket No. 12.  See 17-cv-1107.  

III.  NEWLY RECONIZED RIGHT UNDER JOHNSON II                           
    Petitioner Rodríguez-Méndez also challenges his sentence pursuant to 
Johnson v. United States, 135 S.Ct. 2551 (2015).  In the previous Opinion 
and Order the Court ordered the parties to file “official Puerto Rico court 

documents, duly translated showing the crimes to which Rodríguez-Méndez 
pled guilty or was found guilty of and sentenced.”  Docket No. 12 at 12.  The 
Government complied and filed certified translations of petitioner’s four (4) 

convictions for robbery of a vehicle in violation of Article 173-B of the Puerto 
Rico Penal Code (Docket No. 23 at 3).2  Having all documents available, the 

    2The Courts notes that petitioner Rodríguez-Méndez agrees that he was convicted four (4) times 
for robbery of a motor vehicle under Article 173-B of the Puerto Rico Penal Code. Docket No. 24 at 12 (“the 
parties nevertheless agree that Mr. Rodríguez was actually convicted of violating Article 173B”); see P.R. 
Laws Ann. Tit. 33, § 4279b.                                            
Related Criminal 05-0340(CCC)                                          


Court proceeds to decide if petitioner’s convictions for carjacking qualify as a 
violent felonies under the ACCA enhancement.  18 U.S.C. § 924(e).      
    Unfortunately for movant, there is no relief available under Johnson II. 
The  ACCA  defines  the  term  “violent  felony”  as  any  crime  punishable  by 
imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that “has as an element the use, 
attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of 
another[.]”  18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)(2)(B)(i).                           
    “To determine whether a crime requires the use, attempted use, or 

threatened  use  of  violent  force,  [the  Court  must]  apply  a  categorical 
approach.” United States v. Taylor, 848 F.3d 476, 491 (1st Cir. 2017).  The 
approach requires the courts to consider the elements3 of the crime and 
asses whether violent force is an element of the crime.  Id. (citing United 

States  v.  Fish,  758 F.3d 1, 5  (1st Cir. 2014)).    In  doing  so,  courts  must 
disregard the facts of how the crime was actually committed.  Id.      
    “Some crimes are defined broadly enough to cover some conduct that 

meets the force clause definition and some conduct that does not.”  Taylor, 
848 F.3d at 492. If the statute is overbroad, the court must conclude that it 


    3“‘Elements’ are the ‘constituent parts’ of a crime's legal definition—the things the “prosecution 
must prove to sustain a conviction.” Mathis v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2248 (2016) (citing Black’s 
Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014).                                    
Related Criminal 05-0340(CCC)                                          


“cannot support a conviction under the ACCA.”  Id.; see Fish, 758 F.3d at 6 
(“a  state's  definition  of  a  crime  is  overbroad  if  its  elements  allow  for  a 
conviction without satisfying the elements Congress has provided to define 
the required predicate offense”).                                      
    Puerto Rico’s robbery statute is the prototypical overbroad crime that 
does not meet the force clause definition for a “violent felony.”  See United 
States v. Castro-Vazquez, 176 F. Supp. 3d 13, 21 (D.P.R. 2016) (stating that 
Puerto Rico’s robbery statute is “non-violent because the local courts have 

interpreted the robbery statute to cover purse snatchings and other less-
forceful acts”). This is so, because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held 
“that the slightest use of force is sufficient for the commission of [robbery.]” 
Pueblo v. Batista Montanez, 13 P.R. Offic. Trans. 401, 410 (1982).  In sum, 

Puerto Rico’s robbery statute does not distinguish between degrees of force. 
Id. at 408.                                                            
    Given the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico’s broad definition of robbery, 

the statute does not meet the physical pain or injury element required by 
Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 140 (2010) (“statutory definition of 
‘violent felony,’ the phrase ‘physical force’ means violent force—that is, force 

capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person”).  Due to the 
Related Criminal 05-0340(CCC)                                          


broad definition, the Court must conclude that robbery is not a violent felony 
under the ACCA force clause.  18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)(2)(B)(i).          
    However, the inquiry does not end here.  The Court must still determine 
if Article 173-B of the Puerto Rico Penal Code of 1974, P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 33, 
§ 4279b, which criminalizes robbery of a vehicle (“carjacking”), is a ‘violent 
felony’  under  18 U.S.C.  § 924(e)(1)(2)(B)(i).    The  parties  agree  that  the 
carjacking statute require the same elements as robbery, with two additional 
components which are: (1) the use of an object capable of causing grave 

bodily injury, and (2) the taking of a motor vehicle.4  P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 33, 
§ 4279b.                                                               
    The carjacking statute in Article 173-B enhances the robbery statute in 
Article 173 by adding a deadly or dangerous weapon element to the crime. In 

United States v. Taylor, 848 F.3d 476, 494 (1st Cir. 2017), the court defined a 
deadly or dangerous weapon as “any object which, as used or attempted to 
be used, may endanger the life of or inflict great bodily harm on a person.”  


    4Puerto Rico’s carjacking statute in relevant part states:        

    Any  person  who,  using  an  object  capable  of  causing  grave  bodily  injury,  unlawfully 
    appropriates him or herself of a motor vehicle belonging to another, taking it away from the 
    person, or from the person in whose possession it is at the time, In his/her immediate 
    presence and against his/her will, through the use of violence or intimidation, shall be 
    sanctioned with a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen (18) years. 

P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 33, § 4279b.                                       
Related Criminal 05-0340(CCC)                                          


As stated in Taylor “the element of a dangerous weapon imports the ‘violent 
force’  required  by  Johnson  into  the  otherwise  overbroad  simple  assault 
statute.”    Id.  (citing  United  States  v.  Whindleton,  797 F.3d 105, 114 
(1st Cir. 2015)).                                                      
    After examining Taylor, and using a categorical approach, the Court 
holds that the carjacking element requiring the use of a deadly or dangerous 
weapon  imports  the  ‘violent  force’  required  by  Johnson  into  the  robbery 
statute.  See Taylor, 848 F.3d at 494 (citing Whindleton, 797 F.3d at 114)). 

Therefore,  carjacking  is  a  violent  felony  under  the  ACCA  force  clause, 
18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)(2)(B)(i).  This “enhancement necessarily requires the 
use or threat of force ‘capable of causing physical pain or injury to another 
[person].’”    Taylor,  848 F.3d  at 494  (citing  Johnson,  559 U.S.  at 140). 

Accordingly,  petitioner  Rodríguez-Méndez’s  four  armed  carjacking  
convictions are violent crimes and qualify him for the ACCA enhancement.  
    Petitioner  relies  on  United  States  v.  Parnell,  818 F.3d 974 

(9th Cir. 2016), to argue that the use of a deadly weapon is not dispositive. 
Docket  No. 8  at 14.    The  Court  disagrees.  In  Parnell  the  court  held  that 
“because  the  degree  of  force  required  to  commit  armed  robbery  in 

Massachusetts  is  immaterial  so  long  as  the  victim  is  aware  of  it, 
Related Criminal 05-0340(CCC)                                          


Massachusetts' armed robbery statute does not have ‘as an element the use, 
attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of 
another.’”    Parnell,  818 F.3d  at 981.    As  noted  by  petitioner,  the  armed 
robbery statute in Parnell, “does not require that the weapon be specifically 
used or displayed, or that the victim is aware of its presence.”  Id.; Parnell, 
818 F.3d at 980 (citing King v. MacEachern, 665 F.3d 247 (1st Cir. 2011)).5 
But, contrary to the armed robbery statute in Parnell, the plain language of 
Article 173-B suggests that the person who violates the carjacking statute 

must commit the crime “using an object capable of causing grave bodily 
injury[.]”  P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 33, § 4279b.                           
IV.  CONCLUSION                                                        
    For the reasons stated, petitioner Julio A. Rodríguez-Méndez’s federal 

habeas relief requested in the Supplemental Brief in Support of Petitioner’s 
Section  2255  Motion  (Docket  No. 8),  Second  Supplemental  Motion  in 
Support of  Petitioner’s  Motion  to  Vacate  (Docket  No. 11),  and Motion  to 

Reconsider--and  in  Compliance  with--Opinion  and  Order  at  Docket  Entry 
No. 12 (Docket No. 24) are DENIED.  No certificate of appealability shall be 


    5The Court in United States v. Parnell, 818 F.3d at 979, further clarifies that “[t]he weapon, 
however, need not be ‘fired, employed to effectuate the robbery, used in a threatening manner, or even 
generally or openly displayed.’ King, 665 F.3d at 253.”
