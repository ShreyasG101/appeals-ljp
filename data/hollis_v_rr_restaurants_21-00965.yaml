outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Zoe Hollis''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Hollis argued that the district court erred in holding that an FLSA retaliation claim requires the plaintiff to have been an employee of the alleged retaliator (here, Dante’s or Faillace as proprietor of Dante’s) at the time of the alleged retaliatory act, and contended instead that the statute allows a retaliation claim against any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of the actual employer.

  2. Hollis contended that the district court improperly treated the time-bar on their FLSA wage-and-hour and misclassification claims as precluding them from establishing an underlying employer–employee relationship with Sassy’s for purposes of the FLSA retaliation claim.

  3. Hollis argued that Faillace’s cancellation of their scheduled performance at Dante’s and barring them from future work there, because they had filed the FLSA lawsuit against Sassy’s, constituted actionable retaliation under the FLSA rather than a non-actionable business decision.'
