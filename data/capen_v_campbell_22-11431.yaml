reason_for_appeal: '=== Joseph R. Capen; National Association for Gun Rights''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the Massachusetts law prohibiting the sale, transfer, or possession of ''assault weapons'' and ''large capacity feeding devices'' violates the Second Amendment on its face.

  2. Appellants contended, in the alternative, that the Massachusetts Ban violates the Second Amendment as applied to law-abiding adults seeking to acquire, use, transfer, or possess arms that are in common use by the American public for lawful purposes.

  3. Appellants asserted that the district court erred in denying their motion for a preliminary injunction by concluding they could not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their Second Amendment claims.

  4. Appellants argued that the Massachusetts Ban''s restrictions on certain semiautomatic handguns are unconstitutional, referencing Supreme Court precedent that bans on handguns for self-defense in the home are impermissible.

  5. Appellants challenged the district court''s reliance on historical analogues such as regulations of Bowie knives, clubs, and trap guns, arguing these are not analogous to a categorical ban on weapons in common use.

  6. Appellants objected to the district court''s finding that the banned weapons are ''dangerous and unusual'' and therefore outside Second Amendment protection.

  7. Appellants disputed the district court''s conclusion that the Massachusetts Ban is justified by public safety concerns related to mass shootings, arguing that such events are relatively rare and cannot justify depriving law-abiding citizens of arms in common use.'
