outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Keisha Reynolds''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the District Court erred in denying her request for appointment of pro bono counsel to assist her in opposing CT Transit''s summary judgment motion.

  2. Appellant contended that, as a result of the denial of appointed counsel, the summary judgment ruling was rendered on an incomplete record.

  3. Appellant argued that because the District Court had previously granted her appointed counsel on several occasions, principles of ''stare decisis'' gave her a ''vested right'' in appointed counsel for the remainder of the litigation.'
