                        July 30, 2024                                   

STEARNS, D.J.                                                             
   This  putative  class  action  against  Massachusetts  Institute  of 
Technology (MIT) challenges the adequacy of MIT’s response to acts of     
antisemitism occurring on its campus.  Plaintiffs StandWithUs Center for  
Legal  Justice  (SCLJ),  Katerina  Boukin,  and  Marilyn  Meyers  claim  that, 
after the bloody October 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, repeated 
incidents of antisemitic conduct took place on the MIT campus, causing    
Jewish  and  Israeli  students  to  fear  for  their  personal  safety.    The  First 
Amended Complaint (FAC) alleges four counts:  deliberate indifference to a 
hostile educational environment impacting Jewish and Israeli students in  
violation  of  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  42  U.S.C.  § 2000d 
(Count I); failure to prevent a conspiracy to interfere with civil rights in 
violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1986 (Count II); negligence (Count III); and breach 
of contract (Count IV).1  Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages 

and prospective injunctive relief.                                        
   MIT now moves to dismiss the FAC, lodging challenges under Rules     
12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  On July 24, 2024, the court convened a hearing on 
MIT’s  motion.    After  careful  consideration  and  commendable  argument 

from both sides, the court will allow MIT’s motion.                       
                      BACKGROUND                                        
   The relevant facts, drawn from the FAC and taken in the light most   

favorable to plaintiffs, are as follows.  On October 7, 2023, the Palestinian 
Sunni Islamist terrorist group Hamas committed a violent terrorist attack 
on  Israel.2    The  day  after  the  attack,  multiple  MIT  student  groups  – 
including  the  Coalition  Against  Apartheid  (CAA)  and  Palestine@MIT  – 

released a joint statement “hold[ing] the Israeli regime responsible for all 
unfolding violence.”  FAC ¶ 147.  The statement was posted on CAA’s and   

   1  Counts I-III  are  alleged  by  all  plaintiffs.    Count IV  is  alleged  by 
Boukin and Meyers individually and, for injunctive relief only, on behalf of 
a putative class of “[a]ll Jewish and/or Israeli students enrolled at MIT 
after October 7, 2023, who did not participate in the pro-Palestine protests 
described [in the FAC].”  First Am. Compl. (FAC) (Dkt. # 40) ¶ 366.       

   2  “Hamas”  is  an  acronym  for  Harakat  al-Muqawama  al-Islamiya, 
which translates roughly into Islamic Resistance Movement.  In 1997, the  
U.S. Department of State designated Hamas as a Terrorist Organization     
under § 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1189.      
Palestine@MIT’s blogs, was sent to every undergraduate student’s email,   
and was shared on Palestine@MIT’s Instagram account.  See id. ¶ 145.  On  

October 19, 2023, CAA hosted a rally, which Meyers attended.  A protestor 
shouted at Meyers and a friend, “Your ancestors . . . didn’t die to kill more 
people.”  Id. ¶ 156.  Others at the rally chanted phrases such as “Palestine 
will be free, from the river to the sea.”3  Id. ¶ 157.  Student groups continued 

demonstrating throughout the semester, walking out of classes, organizing 
“die-ins,” and protesting in Lobby 7, a “major thoroughfare” on the MIT   
campus.  See id. ¶¶ 159-162, 169-188.                                     

   On  November 9,  President  Sally  Kornbluth  issued  a  statement   
warning the Lobby 7 protestors that their conduct violated MIT’s Code of  
Conduct;  threatening  the  students  with  disciplinary  action,  including 
potential suspension; and ordering them to vacate Lobby 7 immediately.4   



   3 “From the river to the sea” refers to the area between the Jordan  
River  and  the Mediterranean  Sea,  in  which  Israel,  the  West  Bank,  East 
Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip are located.  While some claim the phrase is 
a call for peace in the region, many, including the majority of members of 
the  U.S.  House  of  Representatives,  condemn  the  phrase  as  “outrightly 
antisemitic.”  See H.R. Res. 883, 118th Cong. (2023).                     

   4  MIT  provided  documents  intended  to  show  that  MIT  began    
responding forcefully to the intimidation of Jewish and Israeli students on 
October 10, 2023.  See Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def. MIT’s Mot. to Dismiss 
the  Am.  Compl.  (Mot.),  Ex. 1  (Dkt.  # 42-2).    As  these  are  not  properly 
before the court on a 12(b)(6) motion (and they have no bearing on MIT’s  
After  deciding  that  suspending  students  could  lead  to  “collateral 
consequences . . . such as visa issues,” MIT changed course and chose to  

suspend student violators from only non-academic campus activities.  Id.  
¶ 184.  Around the same time, MIT also provisionally suspended CAA, see   
id. ¶ 125 n.3, and created the Standing Together Against Hate initiative, 
which was intended to “spearhead efforts to combat antisemitism at MIT,”5 

id. ¶ 201.                                                                
   As the protests continued over the academic year, many Jewish and    
Israeli  MIT  students,  including  plaintiffs  and  SCLJ’s  members,  felt 

abandoned by the school’s administration.  For example, when a member of  
Congress asked President Kornbluth whether “calling for the genocide of   
Jews  violate[s]  MIT’s  code  of  conduct,”  President  Kornbluth  gave  a 
hairsplitting  legalistic  response:  “If  targeted  at  individuals,  not  making 

public statements.”  Id. ¶ 198.  And when students complained to MIT’s    
Institute Discrimination & Harassment Response Office (IDHR) about the    
perceived antisemitic incidents, IDHR responded that the complained-of    
conduct “did not seem to violate the policies that IDHR has jurisdiction  



12(b)(1) motion), the court is unable to consider them.  See Trans-Spec   
Truck Serv., Inc. v. Caterpillar Inc., 524 F.3d 315, 321 (1st Cir. 2008).

over” and, moreover, that Jews are not members of a protected class.  Id. 
¶ 205.                                                                    

   The protest activity at MIT reached a boiling point on April 21, 2024, 
when students erected an encampment on Kresge lawn (across from Hillel,   
an  organization  promoting  Jewish  campus  life),  protesting  Zionism  and 
MIT’s ties to Israeli academics and government contractors.  See id. ¶ 221.  

A  Jewish  student  promptly  emailed  MIT  Chancellor  Melissa  Nobles   
expressing dismay over the encampment, prompting Chancellor Nobles to     
reply that MIT was “working to move in a constructive direction with those 

who are protesting.”  Id. ¶ 224.                                          
   A  week  after  the  encampment  appeared,  President  Kornbluth     
released a video statement.  She informed students that the encampment    
violated MIT policy but, in the interest of protecting free speech, MIT had 

elected not to forcibly remove the student protestors.  See MIT Community 
Message    from    President   Kornbluth    (April   27,   2024),         
https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/video-transcript-mit-

   6 Plaintiffs cite – and link – to the transcript of President Kornbluth’s 
speech in the FAC, so the court may consider it.  See Beddall v. State St.

hours  a  day.    See  id.    On  May 6,  President  Kornbluth  warned  student 
demonstrators  that  if  they  did  not  take  down  the  tents  and  leave  by 

2:30pm, they would face disciplinary proceedings.  FAC ¶ 238.  All but five 
students eventually complied with President Kornbluth’s ultimatum.  See   
Sally  Kornbluth,  Update  on  the  Encampment   (May  6,  2024),         
https://orgchart.mit.edu/letters/update-encampment.    Despite  the       

departure of most of the protestors, that evening, “an individual jumped  
over  the  fencing  surrounding  the  [mostly  abandoned  encampment],    
causing a surge, and soon the area was breached,” and the encampment      

started anew.  FAC ¶ 239.  Tensions continued to rise over the next several 
days.  On May 8, after protestors defaced Israeli flags, “[t]he day ended 
with more suspensions.”  Sally Kornbluth, Actions This Morning (May 10,   
2024),  https://orgchart.mit.edu/letters/actions-encampment.    The  next 

day, protestors blocked Vassar Street – a main campus thoroughfare – and, 
after refusing to disperse, nine of them were arrested.  Id.  On May 10, after 
further police pressure, the encampment was discontinued.  See id.        
   MIT  maintains  various  policies  that  govern  student  conduct,   

including  the  Code  of  Conduct,  Chalking  Policy,  and  Events  Policy, 
(together, the Policies).  The Policies proscribe, inter alia, physical violence, 
behavior that has “serious ramifications” for the wellbeing of any student, 
and discrimination.  If a student violates the Policies, they are subject to a 
salmagundi  of  discipline,  including  a  warning,  probation,  suspension, 

expulsion, or degree revocation.  The Chalking Policy limits where students 
may chalk and hang posters and prohibits the removing or defacing of other 
groups’  posters.    The  Events  Policy  bans  expression  used  to  harass, 
discriminate against, or target any groups or individuals.                

                        DISCUSSION                                      
Subject Matter Jurisdiction                                               
   MIT  challenges  the  court’s  jurisdiction  on  three grounds:  (1) SCLJ 

lacks associational standing to pursue any of the claims; (2) all plaintiffs 
lack  standing  to  obtain  prospective  injunctive  relief;  and  (3) Count I  is 
unripe.  To establish standing, plaintiffs must, “for each claim that they 
press and for each form of relief that they seek,” “establish each part of a 

familiar triad: injury, causation, and redressability.”  TransUnion LLC v. 
Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021); Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 71 
(1st Cir. 2012).  Standing to seek prospective relief hinges on a showing that 
the plaintiff is “likely to suffer future injury.”  City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 

95, 105 (1983).                                                           
   An  association  has  standing  to  sue  on  its  members’  behalf  when 
“(a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; 
(b) the  interests  it  seeks  to  protect  are  germane  to  the  organization’s 
purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires 

the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Hunt v. Wash.   
State  Apple  Advert.  Comm’n,  432  U.S.  333,  342  (1977).    Because  an 
association’s members are not parties to the case, to recover damages on  
behalf of its members, the association must show that the damages are     

“common to the entire membership.”  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515    
(1975).    Similar  conditions  apply  to  injunctive  relief;  if  “member 
circumstances differ and proof of them is important,” the association lacks 

standing to obtain an injunction for  its members.  N.H. Motor Transp.    
Ass’n v. Rowe, 448 F.3d 66, 72 (1st Cir. 2006), quoting Pharm. Care Mgm’t 
Ass’n v. Rowe, 429 F.3d 294, 314 (1st Cir. 2005) (Boudin, J., concurring).   
   In assessing ripeness, the court considers “the fitness of the issues for 

judicial  decision  and  the  hardship  to  the  parties  of  withholding  court 
consideration.”    Abbott  Lab’ys  v.  Gardner,  387  U.S.  136,  149  (1967), 
abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977).  A 
claim is not fit for decision if it “rests upon contingent future events that 

may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.”  City of Fall 
River v. F.E.R.C., 507 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2007), quoting Texas v. United 
States, 523 U.S. 296, 300 (1998).                                         
   The  court  perceives  no  jurisdictional  bar  to  this  case  proceeding.  
Although  MIT  is  correct  that  SCLJ  lacks  standing  to  seek  damages  on 

Counts I and III,7 Boukin and Meyers have standing to seek damages for    
these counts.  Because the FAC plausibly alleges ongoing injuries, Boukin 
and Meyers also have standing to seek prospective injunctive relief.  See 
Roe v. Healey, 78 F.4th 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2023).  Nor is the court persuaded 

that  SCLJ’s  members  need  to be  joined  as  parties  to  the  case.    Even  if 
SCLJ’s  claims  require  “proof  specific  to  individual  members  of  the 
association,”  this  is  no  bar  to  associational  standing  for  purposes  of 

injunctive relief.  See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of P.R., 
906 F.2d 25, 35 (1st Cir. 1990).                                          
   Plaintiffs’ Title VI claim is also ripe.  MIT argues that it should not 
have to “defend the adequacy of its response [to on-campus antisemitism]  

while that response [is] underway.”  Mot. at 21.  Boukin’s and Meyers’s   
damages claims depend, however, on past events that have fully unfolded,  


   7  SCLJ  seeks  to  recover  compensatory  and  punitive  damages  on 
behalf  of  its  members.    Because  Title  VI  is  “much  in  the  nature  of  a 
contract,” the scope of available damages relief is contractual in nature.  
Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-187 (2002), quoting Pennhurst State   
Sch.  &  Hosp.  v.  Halderman,  451  U.S.  1,  17  (1981)  (emphasis  omitted).  
Contractual  damages,  however,  are  not  “common  to  the  entire       
membership.”  See Warth, 422 U.S. at 515.  So, too, is the case with tort-
based damages, which are designed to redress individualized non-economic  
losses.                                                                   
so  there  can  be  no  dispute  that  they  are  ripe.    See  Ernst  &  Young  v. 
Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir. 1995).  And MIT’s 

arguments that plaintiffs’ claim for prospective injunctive relief is unripe 
turn  largely  on  the  merits  of  the  dispute,  i.e.,  whether  MIT  has  been 
deliberately indifferent and whether this alleged deliberate indifference is 
“sufficiently likely to happen” when campus life resumes this fall.  See Gun 

Owners’ Action League, Inc. v. Swift, 284 F.3d 198, 205 (1st Cir. 2002).  
Because the ripeness issue is intertwined with the merits, the court need 
not rule on it at this juncture.  See Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 

358, 363 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001)                                              
Failure to State a Claim                                                  
   To  survive  a  motion  to  dismiss  under  Rule  12(b)(6),  a  complaint 
“must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to 

relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 
(2009), quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  If 
the allegations in the complaint are “too meager, vague, or conclusory to 
remove  the  possibility  of  relief  from the  realm  of  mere  conjecture,”  the 

complaint will be dismissed.  SEC v. Tambone, 597 F.3d 436, 442 (1st Cir. 
2010) (en banc).                                                          
(a)  Count I:  Title VI                                                 
   Title VI forbids recipients of federal funds from discriminating “on 

the ground of race, color, or national origin.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  The  
parties agree that discrimination against Jewish students comes within the 
statute’s  prohibition.    A  Title  VI  hostile  environment  claim8  has  five 
elements:  (1) plaintiffs were “subject to ‘severe, pervasive, and objectively 

offensive’ . . . harassment”; (2) the harassment “caused the plaintiff to be 
deprived of educational opportunities or benefits”; (3) the school “knew of 
the harassment”; (4) the harassment occurred “in [the school’s] programs  

and  activities”;  and  (5) the  school  “was  deliberately  indifferent  to  the 
harassment such that its response (or lack thereof) is clearly unreasonable 
in light of the known circumstances.”  Porto v. Town of Tewksbury, 488    



   8 Although the FAC also gestures at a direct discrimination theory,  
plaintiffs have not pursued this theory in their briefing on the motion to 
dismiss.  At any rate, plaintiffs’ direct discrimination theory is indubitably 
one  of  vicarious  liability.    Although there  is  no Supreme  Court  or  First 
Circuit  precedent  squarely  addressing  the  issue,  the Supreme  Court  has 
held that a school district cannot be held vicariously liable under Title IX 
for the actions of its teachers.  See Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 
524  U.S.  274,  288  (1998).    The  remedial  schemes  for  Titles  VI  and  IX 
generally mirror one another.  See Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm.,   
555 U.S. 246, 258 (2009); see also Doe v. Galster, 768 F.3d 611, 617 (7th 
Cir. 2014) (“Title VI and Title IX are so similar that a decision interpreting 
one generally applies to the other.”).  It follows that vicarious liability is 
unavailable under Title VI.  See Corbett ex rel. Corbett v. Browning, 2024 
WL 862160, at *3 (D. Mass. Feb. 13, 2024).                                
F.3d 67, 72-73 (1st Cir. 2007), quoting Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 
526 U.S. 629, 650 (1999).                                                 

   Deliberate indifference is a “stringent standard of fault.”  Bd. of the 
Cnty. Comm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 410 (1997).  “[A] claim that an     
institution could or should have done more does not establish deliberate  
indifference.”  M.L. ex rel. D.L. v. Concord Sch. Dist., 86 F.4th 501, 511 (1st 

Cir. 2023).  Rather, plaintiffs must allege facts showing that MIT’s response 
to the incidents was “so lax, so misdirected, or so poorly executed as to be 
clearly  unreasonable  under  the  known  circumstances.”    Fitzgerald  v. 

Barnstable Sch. Comm., 504 F.3d 165, 175 (1st Cir. 2007), rev’d on other  
grounds, 555 U.S. 246 (2009).  The test is not to be viewed through the lens 
of hindsight; instead, the court must consider whether MIT responded in a 
clearly unreasonable manner based on what it knew at the time.  See Porto, 

488 F.3d at 74; see also Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 844 (1994) (even 
where officials are aware of a risk of harm, they “may be found free from 
liability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately 
was  not  averted”).    Boiled  down  to  its  essence,  deliberate  indifference 

means  affirmatively  choosing  to  do  the  wrong  thing,  or  doing  nothing, 
despite knowing what the law requires.  Tempered by this understanding,   
the court cannot find that MIT acted with deliberate indifference.        
   The FAC compellingly depicts a campus embroiled in an internecine    
conflict that caused Jewish and Israeli students great anguish.  Plaintiffs 

frame MIT’s response to the conflict largely as one of inaction.  But the facts 
alleged tell a different story.  Far from sitting on its hands, MIT took steps 
to contain the escalating on-campus protests that, in some instances, posed 
a genuine threat to the welfare and safety of Jewish and Israeli students, 

who were at times personally victimized by the hostile demonstrators.  MIT 
began  by  suspending  student  protestors  from  non-academic  activities, 
permitting them only to attend academic classes, while suspending one of  

the  most  undisciplined  of  the  pro-Palestine  student  groups.    These 
measures proved ineffective when, in April of 2024, protestors erected the 
Kresge  lawn  encampment.    MIT  immediately  warned  students  of       
impending disciplinary action, but its threat went unheeded when student  

demonstrators  “surge[d]”  and  “breached”  the  largely  evacuated       
encampment.  When MIT’s attempt to peacefully clear the encampment        
proved futile, it suspended and arrested trespassing students.            
   In  hindsight,  one  might  envision  things  MIT  could  have  done 

differently.  Indeed, some campus administrators elsewhere, as plaintiffs 
allege, reacted to the protests differently (and with more positive results) 
than MIT.  But that is not the applicable standard.  That MIT’s evolving and 
progressively punitive response largely tracked its increasing awareness of 
the  hostility  that  demonstrators  directed  at  Jewish  and  Israeli  students 

shows that MIT did not react in a clearly unreasonable manner.            
   The court adds some concluding thoughts.  The pain and hurt felt by  
plaintiffs and the Jewish and Israeli students that they seek to represent is 
genuine and fully understandable.  But at bottom, the fault attributed to 

MIT  is  its  failure  to  anticipate  the  bigoted  behavior  that  some 
demonstrators – however sincere their disagreement with U.S. and Israeli  
policies – would exhibit as events unfolded.  The transgressors were, after 

all, mostly MIT students whom the school (perhaps naively) thought had    
internalized the values of tolerance and respect for others – even those with 
whom  one  might  disagree  –  that  a  modern  liberal  university  education 
seeks to instill.  To fault MIT for what proved to be a failure of clairvoyance 

and  a  perhaps  too  measured  response  to  an  outburst  of  ugliness  on  its 
campus  would  send  the  unhelpful  message  that  anything  less  than  a 
faultless  response  in  similar  circumstances  would  earn  no  positive 
recognition in the eyes of the law.  Count I will thus be dismissed.      

(b)  Count II:  42 U.S.C. § 1986                                        
   Plaintiffs seek to hold MIT liable under § 1986 for knowingly failing 
to prevent the formation of a conspiracy consisting of MIT student groups 
to deprive plaintiffs of their civil rights.9  An essential element of this claim 
is proof of at least one of the conspiracies defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1985.  See 

Gattineri v. Town of Lynnfield, 58 F.4th 512, 516 (1st Cir. 2023).  Plaintiffs 
look  to  § 1985(3),  which  prohibits  conspiracies  undertaken  to  deprive, 
“either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal 
protection  of  the laws,  or  of  equal  privileges  and  immunities  under  the 

laws.”  42 U.S.C. § 1985(3).                                              
   To plead an actionable § 1985(3) conspiracy, plaintiffs must allege:  
(1) the existence of a conspiracy; (2) that the “purpose of the conspiracy 

[was] ‘to deprive the plaintiff[s] of the equal protection of the laws’”; (3) at 
least one overt act was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy; and   
(4) “either injury to person or property, or deprivation of a constitutionally 
protected  right”  followed  as  a  consequence  of  the  illegal  undertaking.  

Alston v. Spiegel, 988 F.3d 564, 577 (1st Cir. 2021), quoting Péréz-Sánchez 
v. Pub. Bldg. Auth., 531 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir. 2008).  To plausibly plead 
that a conspiracy existed, plaintiffs must allege either “facts indicating an 
agreement  among  the  conspirators”  or  facts  “sufficient  to  support  a 

reasonable  inference  that  such  an  agreement  was  made.”    Parker  v. 

   9 The court is aware of no case (and plaintiffs cite none) holding a 
party liable under § 1986 for failing to prevent a conspiracy in which the 
party was not involved.  Nonetheless, the court will proceed on the shaky 
assumption that § 1986 liability could attach in these circumstances.     
Landry, 935 F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 2019).  The requisite agreement must be to 
deprive plaintiffs of their civil rights.  See Bray v. Alexandria Women’s 

Health Clinic, 506 U.S. 263, 275 (1993) (the right’s “impairment must be a 
conscious objective of the enterprise”).                                  
   Plaintiffs fail to plead any conspiratorial agreement.  They claim that 
MIT  student  groups  (1)  jointly  announced  rallies,  walkouts,  and  the 

encampment;  (2)  had  overlapping  membership;  and  (3)  recruited      
participants for (and participated in) the encampment.  These allegations 
establish  that  student  groups  acted  in  concert  to  plan  protest  events 

advocating their shared views, but nothing in the FAC raises a plausible  
inference that the groups agreed to plan the events “at least in part for the 
very purpose of” depriving plaintiffs of their civil rights.  See id. at 276.  Nor 
does plaintiffs’ contention that the “clear practical effect” of the protests 

“was to impede the rights of Jewish and Israeli students on campus” rescue 
their claim.  See Pls.’ Mem. of Law in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss the 
Am. Compl. (Dkt. # 46) at 26.  “A conspiracy is not ‘for the purpose’ of  
denying equal protection simply because it has an effect upon a protected 

right.”10  Bray, 506 U.S. at 275.  Count II will therefore be dismissed.   


   10  It  is  also  unclear  whether  student  groups,  rather  than  their 
constituent members, can form a § 1985(3) conspiracy.  In the somewhat    
analogous civil RICO context, “[i]t is only a person, or one associated with 
(c)  Counts III and IV:  Negligence and Breach of Contract              
   Having  dismissed  all  claims  over  which  the  court  has  original 

jurisdiction (and because plaintiffs have not pled diversity jurisdiction), the 
court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state-
law claims.  See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 (1988); 
28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).                                                   

                          ORDER                                         
   For the foregoing reasons, MIT’s motion to dismiss the federal claims 
(Counts I and II) is ALLOWED.  The court declines to exercise jurisdiction 

over the state-law claims (Counts III and IV).  The Clerk will close the case.   
                            SO ORDERED.

an enterprise, not the enterprise itself, who can violate” RICO.  Schofield v. 
First Commodity Corp. of Bos., 793 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1986).  Other    
courts have concluded in the § 1985(3) context that “fail[ure] to allege with 
any specificity the persons who agreed to the alleged conspiracy” dooms a 
civil rights conspiracy claim.  E.g., A Soc’y Without a Name v. Virginia, 655 
F.3d 342, 347 (4th Cir. 2011).
