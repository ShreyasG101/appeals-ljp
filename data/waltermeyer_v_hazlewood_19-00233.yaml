outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Broc T. Waltermeyer''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that his Eighth Amendment claim for damages against a federal Bureau of Prisons doctor and warden for allegedly inadequate medical treatment is not ''meaningfully different'' from the claim recognized in Carlson v. Green, and therefore should be allowed under Bivens.

  2. Appellant contended that his claim is not a ''new context'' because, like Carlson, it alleges cruel and unusual punishment through inadequate medical care at a federal prison, is brought against prison officials of similar rank, and involves personal injury from direct harm while in their care.

  3. Appellant asserted that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint on the basis that he had an alternative administrative remedy.

  4. Appellant objected to the district court''s reliance on ''policy'' grounds for dismissal, arguing that his operative complaint did not raise policy issues and that such analysis was improper.'
