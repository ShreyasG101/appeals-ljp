outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Axis Insurance Company''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Axis argued that the district court erred in denying equitable indemnification from Barracuda, contending that the court improperly focused on the legal status of the parties'' relationship rather than the factual circumstances that, in Axis''s view, demonstrated derivative or vicarious liability.

  2. Axis contended that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Fusion''s breach of contract claim, arguing that Barracuda had waived the OEM''s condition precedent by failing to exercise its contractual right to audit Fusion''s customer contracts, or alternatively, that Barracuda was estopped from relying on the condition precedent due to its inaction.

  3. Axis argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for Barracuda on the claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, asserting that substantial evidence showed Barracuda deprived Fusion of the benefit of its contractual bargain and acted in bad faith in its handling of the data breach and related communications.'
