outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Defendants argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Yuga on its Lanham Act false-designation-of-origin (trademark infringement) claim because Yuga failed to prove a likelihood of consumer confusion as a matter of law, including under the Sleekcraft factors.

  2. Defendants contended that Yuga has no enforceable trademark rights in the BAYC Marks because NFTs are not "goods" within the meaning of the Lanham Act and therefore cannot be protected by trademark law.

  3. Defendants argued that even if NFTs can be trademarked, Yuga lacked trademark priority or enforceable rights because its use of the BAYC Marks was unlawful, asserting that Yuga sold the BAYC NFTs as unregistered securities and that this unlawful conduct barred trademark protection.

  4. Defendants contended that Yuga no longer owned or had enforceable rights in the BAYC Marks because Yuga had assigned or transferred away its trademark rights through its Terms and Conditions and related transactions, including by granting purchasers "all IP rights" and by failing to exercise adequate quality control, amounting to abandonment or naked licensing, and by failing to police unlicensed commercial uses.

  5. Defendants argued that their use of the BAYC Marks could not give rise to trademark infringement because it constituted nominative fair use, asserting that they used Yuga’s marks to describe or reference Yuga’s own BAYC NFTs and project, including for purposes of criticism, comparison, and commentary.

  6. Defendants contended that their RR/BAYC project and use of Yuga’s marks were part of an expressive art and protest project protected by the First Amendment, and that under the Rogers framework their use of the marks in expressive works could not be the basis for Lanham Act liability.

  7. Defendants argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Yuga on its ACPA cybersquatting claim because the domain names rrbayc.com and apemarket.com are not "identical or confusingly similar" to Yuga’s protected marks or domain as a matter of law, and thus do not satisfy the statutory similarity requirement.

  8. Defendants contended that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Yuga on their DMCA counterclaim under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), asserting that there was a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Yuga knowingly and materially misrepresented in its takedown notices that RR/BAYC content infringed Yuga’s copyrights, particularly because Yuga had no registered copyrights in the Bored Ape images.

  9. Defendants argued that the district court erred in dismissing their declaratory-judgment counterclaims (seeking declarations that Yuga has no copyright in the Bored Ape images) with prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, contending that a jurisdictional dismissal should have been without prejudice.

  10. Defendants further argued that the equitable remedies awarded after the bench trial—including disgorgement of profits, statutory damages for cybersquatting, attorneys’ fees, costs, and the scope of the permanent injunction—should be vacated on the grounds that they violated the First Amendment, the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, and federal equitable principles.'
