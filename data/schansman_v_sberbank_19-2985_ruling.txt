GABRIEL W. GORENSTEIN, United States Magistrate Judge:                    
   Plaintiffs (the “Schansmans”) brought this action under the Antiterrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2331 et seq. (the “ATA”), against a number of financial institutions that are alleged to have 
been involved in funding the terrorist activity that resulted in the death of Quinn Lucas 
Schansman.  In a February 27, 2025, ruling, the Court granted Schansmans’ motion to compel 
the production of documents from defendant VTB Bank PJSC (“VTB”).  See Schansman v. 
Sberbank of Russia PJSC, 2025 WL 630810 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2025).  Before the Court are 
defendant VTB’s motion for reconsideration of that ruling and plaintiffs’ motion to strike a 
declaration submitted with VTB’s motion for reconsideration.1  For the following reasons, both 
motions are denied.                                                       


   1  See VTB Bank (PJSC)’s Notice of Motion for Reconsideration, filed March 12, 2025 
(Docket # 630); VTB Bank PJSC’s Memorandum in Support of Its Motion for Reconsideration, 
filed March 12, 2025 (Docket # 631) (“Mem.”); Declaration of VTB Representative Alexey 
Vladimirovich Lozovoy, filed March 12, 2025 (Docket # 632) (“Lozovoy Decl.”); Plaintiffs’ 
Notice of Motion to Strike the Declaration of VTB Bank PJSC’s General Counsel, Alexey 
Lozovoy, filed March 26, 2025 (Docket # 633); Plaintiffs’ Opposition to VTB Bank PJSC’s 
Motion for Reconsideration and Memorandum of Law in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion to Strike, 
filed March 26, 2025 (Docket # 634) (“Opp.”); VTB Bank PJSC’s Reply Memorandum of Law 
in Further Support of Its Motion for Reconsideration and in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion to 
Strike, filed April 2, 2025 (Docket # 635) (“Reply”).                     
I.   MOTION TO STRIKE                                                     
   Plaintiffs move to strike from the record the sworn declaration of Alexey Vladimirovich 
Lozovoy submitted by VTB with its motion for reconsideration.  See Lozovoy Decl.; Opp. at 7-
8.  To the extent the motion is based on VTB’s alleged failure to comply with the requirement of 

Local Civil Rule 6.3 that advance permission be obtained before filing an affidavit in conjunction 
with a motion for reconsideration, we note that a district court “has broad discretion to determine 
whether to overlook a party’s failure to comply with local court rules.”  Commerzbank AG v. 
U.S. Bank, N.A., 100 F.4th 362, 377 (2d Cir. 2024) (citing Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., 258 F.3d 
62, 73 (2d Cir. 2001)).  We choose to exercise that discretion here as the affidavit has no effect 
on the outcome of the motion.  To the extent plaintiffs argue that the affidavit is improper 
because it relies on facts occurring after the Court’s decision, it is best to address those points in 
the context of deciding whether the motion for reconsideration standard has been met.  
Accordingly, the motion to strike is denied.2                             
II.  MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION                                           

A.   Legal Standard                                                     
   Motions for reconsideration are governed by Local Civil Rule 6.3, which provides that 
the moving party shall set forth “the matters or controlling decisions which counsel believes the 
Court has overlooked.”  Thus, a motion to reconsider is generally denied “unless the moving 
party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked — matters, in other 
words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.”  Shrader 
v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995) (citation omitted).  “The standard for 


   2  We reject plaintiffs’ argument that the declaration cannot be considered because it is not 
accompanied by a certified translation.  See Opp. at 7 n.3.  The sworn declaration is in English 
and we consider only that declaration.  We do not consider the purported Russian translation.  
granting a motion for reconsideration is strict,” RCC Ventures, LLC v. Brandtone Holdings Ltd., 
322 F.R.D. 442, 445 (S.D.N.Y. 2017), and therefore such a motion “is not a vehicle for 
relitigating old issues, presenting the case under new theories, securing a rehearing on the merits, 
or otherwise taking a second bite at the apple.”  Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., 

684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir. 2012) (citation and citation marks omitted).  The Second Circuit has 
held that “[a] motion for reconsideration should be granted only when the [moving party] 
identifies ‘an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need 
to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.’”  Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, 
Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. 
Nat’l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992)).                 
   Further, a party is “barred from making for the first time in a motion for reconsideration 
an argument it could readily have raised when the underlying issue was being briefed but chose 
not to do so.”  Navigators Ins. Co. v. Goyard, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 3d 220, 222 (S.D.N.Y. 2022) 
(citation omitted).  In other words, “‘a party may not advance new facts, issues or arguments not 

previously presented to the Court’ on a motion for reconsideration.”  Steinberg v. Elkman, 2016 
WL 1604764, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2016) (quoting Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA 
v. Stroh Cos., 265 F.3d 97, 115 (2d Cir. 2001)); accord Sigmon v. Goldman Sachs Mortg. Co., 
229 F. Supp. 3d 254, 257 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).                                 
   “Reconsideration ‘is an extraordinary remedy to be employed sparingly in the interests of 
finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.’”  Sigmon, 229 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (citation 
omitted).  The rule permitting reconsideration must be “narrowly construed and strictly applied 
so as to ‘avoid duplicative rulings on previously considered issues.’”  Merced Irrigation Dist. v. 
Barclays Bank PLC, 178 F. Supp. 3d 181, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (citation omitted).  A narrow 
application of the rule not only “helps ‘to ensure the finality of decisions,’” but also “prevent[s] 
the practice of a losing party examining a decision and then plugging the gaps of a lost motion 
with additional matters.”  Henderson v. Metro. Bank & Tr. Co., 502 F. Supp. 2d 372, 376 
(S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Naiman v. N.Y. Univ. Hosps. Ctr., 2005 WL 926904, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 

Apr. 21, 2005)).                                                          
B.   Discussion                                                         
   VTB “seeks reconsideration and modification” of the following aspects of the Court’s 
February 27, 2025, order: “(1) the portion of the Order that could be interpreted as compelling 
VTB to produce material that Plaintiffs have already received from, or could obtain from, third 
parties located in the United States; and (2) the 21-day deadline for VTB’s production of 
documents.”  Mem. at 1, 5.  We will address each of the bases for reconsideration separately. 
     1.  Other Sources for the Records                                  
            a.  Background                                              
   As the Court noted in its February 27, 2025, order, one of the factors considered by courts 

in deciding whether to issue an order directing the production of information located abroad is 
“the availability of alternative means of securing the information.”  Schansman, 2025 WL 
630810, at *13 (citing Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 706 F.3d 92, 98-99 (2d Cir. 2013)).  On this 
issue, plaintiffs in their original briefing provided an extensive explanation as to why “no 
reasonable alternative means exist to secure the information requested from VTB.”  Plaintiffs’ 
Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Renewed Motion to Compel the Production of 
Documents from VTB Bank PJSC, filed August 23, 2024 (Docket # 594), at 30-32. 
   In its opposition brief to plaintiffs’ motion to compel, VTB argued that “[t]here is no 
reason to offend foreign law here, where the documents plaintiffs are seeking to compel consist 
of internal VTB documents (e.g., emails) that have no relevance to this litigation and 
transactional records that plaintiffs already have obtained from third parties.”  VTB Bank PJSC’s 
Memoranum [sic] of Law in Opposition to Motion to Compel, filed September 20, 2024 (Docket 
# 606) (“Mot. to Compel VTB Opp.”), at 53-54.  In the following sentence, VTB recounted that 

“in response to a subpoena served by plaintiffs, Deutsche Bank has produced records of over 
127,000 transactions, none of which reflect the alleged $1,673.55 transfer through VTB’s 
account at Deutsche Bank that serves as the sole basis for personal jurisdiction.”  Id. at 54.  The 
rest of this section in VTB’s brief discusses the issue of personal jurisdiction.  See id.  No other 
“transactional records” that were “obtained from third parties,” id., are mentioned.  In its 
opposition to plaintiffs’ motion to compel, VTB also submitted copies of subpoenas served by 
plaintiffs on a number of banks and a copy of a letter accompanying plaintiffs’ transmission to 
VTB of documents produced by Deutsche Bank, which included 128,000 rows of transactions.  
Declaration of Arthur Kutoroff in Support of Defendant VTB Bank PJSC’s Memorandum of Law 
in Opposition to Motion to Compel, filed September 20, 2024 (Docket # 608).   

   In their reply brief in support of their motion to compel, plaintiffs acknowledged that 
while the “Schansmans have obtained certain discovery from third parties, such as U.S. 
correspondent banks, . . . to the extent records from the relevant time still exist, those records 
reflect only the routing of funds through U.S. correspondent banking accounts.”  Plaintiffs’ 
Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Their Renewed Motion to Compel the 
Production of Documents from VTB Bank PJSC, filed October 15, 2024 (Docket # 615), at 20. 
   In its Opinion and Order, the Court recounted the parties’ briefing on this issue as follows  
   Plaintiffs argue that they have no other source for the documents they seek from 
   VTB given that approval has not been given to release them.  VTB has no 
   response to this argument other than to suggest that plaintiffs should be satisfied 
   with the production made by VTB’s correspondent bank, Deutsche Bank.  
Schansman, 2025 WL 630810, at *16 (citations omitted).  The Court rejected VTB’s argument 
“because [VTB] does not deny the fact that the responsive materials located in Russia are not 
available from any other source.”  Id.  Accordingly, the Court concluded that “[b]ecause 
‘plaintiffs lack sufficient alternative means for obtaining their requested materials,’ this ‘factor 
weighs in favor of granting plaintiffs’ motion to compel.’”  Id. (quoting Wultz v. Bank of China 
Ltd., 910 F. Supp. 2d 548, 558 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).                           
   Today, VTB asks the Court to reconsider its conclusion on “the availability of alternative 
means of securing the information.”  Mem. at 6.                           
   In support, VTB argues that                                          

   since Plaintiffs have already received productions reflecting VTB’s correspondent 
   banking accounts in New York, any further production from VTB of similar 
   records would be unreasonably duplicative.  That alone is a basis to reject 
   Plaintiffs’ attempt to compel the production of these records.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
   26(b)(2)(C)(i) (“the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery … if … 
   the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be 
   obtained from some other source”).                                   

Id. at 6 (ellipses in original).  VTB highlights “[t]hat requiring VTB to provide cumulative or 
duplicative records would also require VTB to violate Russian law and impinge on international 
comity makes it even more unreasonably burdensome.”  Id.  Accordingly, VTB requests “that the 
Court qualify its Order by limiting the order to compel to only those documents located in 
Russia, not documents Plaintiffs have already received, or could obtain, through third party 
subpoenas (even if similar records are also available in Russia).”  Id. at 7.  In a similar vein, VTB 
“requests that the Court reconsider the portion of its Order stating that ‘the responsive materials 
located in Russia are not available from any other source’ because certain responsive materials 
located in Russia (i.e., the correspondent banking records) are available from another source (the 
correspondent banks).”  Id. (citing Schansman, 2025 WL 630810, at *16).   
   In response, plaintiffs argue that VTB has “already made this argument in its opposition 
to the Renewed Motion, and it fails to identify any clear error or manifest injustice warranting a 
different result.”  Opp. at 4.  Nor does VTB identify any “reason beyond the same arguments that 
the Court already considered and rejected.”  Id. at 5.  As to the merits, plaintiffs acknowledge 

that they have “obtained certain discovery from third parties, such as U.S. correspondent banks.”  
Id.  They argue, however, that “without the benefit of discovery from VTB, the Schansman 
family simply cannot know whether that discovery captures the full extent of VTB’s 
correspondent banking records.”  Id.                                      
            b.  Analysis                                                
   In its February 27, 2025, order, the Court rejected the gravamen of VTB’s argument.  
Specifically, the Court has already rejected VTB’s argument that plaintiffs were not entitled to 
VTB bank records on the ground that plaintiffs “have already received productions reflecting 
VTB’s correspondent banking accounts in New York,” Mem. at 6.  See Schansman, 2025 WL 
630810, at *16.  We rejected the argument “because [VTB] does not deny the fact that the 

responsive materials located in Russia are not available from any other source.”  Id.  VTB does 
not assert that the Court’s conclusion on this point was based on a misreading of VTB’s brief or 
erroneously reasoned.  See Mem. at 6-7.  In other words, VTB’s motion for reconsideration 
confirms that in the original briefing VTB never denied “the fact that the responsive materials 
located in Russia are not available from any other source.”  Schansman, 2025 WL 630810, at 
*16.  Accordingly, the Court sees no reason to reconsider its original conclusion.3 


   3  VTB acknowledges that it has “made a similar argument in its opposition to the Motion 
to Compel.”  Mem. at 6 n.3 (citing Mot. to Compel VTB Opp. at 53-54).  VTB explains that it 
“makes this argument on reconsideration to ensure the Court does not overlook that its Order 
could be read as mandating VTB violate Russian law to provide Plaintiffs with duplicative 
documents.”  Id.  In its reply brief, VTB further clarifies that it seeks reconsideration because the 
   VTB seeks a different outcome by arguing that “production from VTB of similar records 
would be unreasonably duplicative.”  Mem. at 6.  VTB invokes Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(i), 
which provides that a “court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery … if … the 
discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other 

source.”  VTB invokes this rule to argue that the allegedly duplicative nature of the requested 
production “alone is a basis to reject Plaintiffs’ attempt to compel the production of these 
records.”  Mem. at 6.  But in its opposition to the original motion to compel, VTB made no 
argument grounded in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26’s reference to “duplicative” production and it provides 
no reason now why it may properly be considered for the first time here.  See Mot. to Compel 
VTB Opp.  Indeed, VTB appeared to have specifically disclaimed such an argument in its 
opposition to the original motion, writing that “this is not a motion about the limits of Rule 26.”  
Id. at 44 (“The document requests at issue . . . are arguably subject to discovery under Rule 26 
because, after a meet-and-confer, the parties agreed on a range of material that VTB would 
search for and seek permission to produce.  But this is not a motion about the limits of Rule 

26.”).                                                                    
   VTB also suggests, for the first time, that the Court should “limit the order to compel to 
only those documents located in Russia, not documents Plaintiffs have already received, or could 
obtain, through third party subpoenas (even if similar records are also available in Russia).”  
Mem. at 7.  VTB provides no explanation as to why this suggestion was not raised in its 
opposition to plaintiffs’ motion to compel and no explanation for how such a suggestion could 


“Order did not directly address the implications of Plaintiffs’ possession of the documents they 
requested.”  Reply at 1.  However, a motion for reconsideration is not granted simply because a 
court has overlooked one potential implication of its ruling; if it were so Local Rule 6.3 could 
lead to a “practice of a losing party examining a decision and then plugging the gaps of a lost 
motion with additional matters.”  Henderson, 502 F. Supp. 2d at 376.      
feasibly be implemented.  Additionally, VTB does not allege any “clear error” or “manifest 
injustice.”  Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, Inc., 729 F.3d at 104.  Accordingly, VTB’s 
suggestion does not warrant reconsideration of the Court’s February 27, 2025, order. 
   Furthermore, VTB proffers, for the first time, that “certain responsive materials located in 

Russia (i.e., the correspondent banking records) are available from another source (the 
correspondent banks).”  Mem. at 6.  But VTB does not explain why it did not present this factual 
assertion in its opposition to plaintiffs’ motion to compel.  Accordingly, this assertion does not 
warrant reconsideration of the Court’s February 27, 2025, order.          
   In sum, in asking the Court to reconsider its conclusion on the “availability of alternative 
means of securing the information,” Schansman, 2025 WL 630810, at *13 (citing Linde, 706 
F.3d at 98-99), VTB does not allege that there has been “an intervening change of controlling 
law,” that “new evidence” has become available, that the Court made a “clear error,” or that 
reconsideration is necessary to “prevent manifest injustice.”  Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of 
Tartikov, Inc., 729 F.3d at 104.  Instead, VTB repeats an old argument previously rejected and 

makes new arguments that it could have previously advanced.  Accordingly, we reject VTB’s 
motion for reconsideration on this point.  See Associated Press v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 395 F. 
Supp. 2d 17, 19 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“It is settled law in this District that a motion for 
reconsideration is neither an occasion for repeating old arguments previously rejected nor an 
opportunity for making new arguments that could have been previously advanced.” (citing 
cases)).                                                                  
   Even on the merits, VTB’s argument is lacking: VTB provides no support for its 
conclusory factual assertions that the “productions reflecting VTB’s correspondent banking 
accounts in New York,” received by plaintiffs are “duplicative” or “similar” to the production at 
issue here.  Mem. at 6.  Nor does VTB provide the Court with any suggestions for how to 
identify which requests for production are duplicative.  Most importantly, VTB fails to explain 
how producing the (allegedly) duplicative records would require VTB to violate additional 
Russian laws or expose it to higher penalties — in other words, VTB offers no showing as to 

why compelling VTB to produce records that may be duplicative would create any new burdens 
for VTB.                                                                  
     2.  Request for an Extension                                       
            a.  Background                                              
   The February 27, 2025, order required “VTB to produce information responsive to 
plaintiffs’ discovery requests 1, 2, 5, 13, 25-27, 30, 32, 40, 50, 52-54, and 59-60 within 21 days 
of the filing of this Opinion and Order.”  Schansman, 2025 WL 630810, at *19.  That deadline 
expired on March 20, 2025, without VTB having filed any request for an extension under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 6(b).                                                             
   Instead, VTB asks the Court to “reconsider” this deadline, adding that the Court should 

“permit VTB to have 61 days after the filing of this motion (i.e., until May 12, 2025) to produce 
documents.”  Mem. at 7.  VTB gives three reasons for its request: (1) VTB is hopeful that certain 
upcoming meetings with representatives of the Ministry and the Central Bank may increase the 
likelihood of Russian regulators changing their mind on whether to approve production; (2) it is 
“possible” that the 2024 United States Presidential election may result in an increasing 
inclination to approve production; (3) because a discovery stay applicable to a co-defendant, 
Sberbank of Russia PJSC, is still in effect pending the final resolution of its appeal, “allowing for 
the modest requested additional time would provide for greater clarity as to the status of 
Sberbank in this litigation.”  Id. at 7-8.                                
            b.  Discussion                                              
   The Court rejects VTB’s motion for reconsideration on this point.    
   Most importantly, VTB does not identify “an intervening change of controlling law, the 
availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.”  

Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, Inc., 729 F.3d at 104.  This alone is ground for denial.  
See id.  Instead, VTB points to three developments that have occurred since the Court issued its 
prior decision.  See Mem. at 7-9.  These developments constitute “new facts” which “may not 
[be] advance[d] . . . on a motion for reconsideration.”  Steinberg, 2016 WL 1604764, at *1 
(citation marks omitted); Cambridge Valley Machining, Inc. v. Hudson MFG LLC, 2020 WL 
5878444, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 2, 2020) (“motion for reconsideration cannot be used to advance 
new facts, issues or arguments not previously presented to the Court” (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted)); Edible Arrangements Intern., Inc. v. JHRV Enterprises, Inc., 2011 WL 
63474, at *1 (D. Conn. Jan. 3, 2011) (“Facts that arise after a court issues a ruling can hardly 
constitute overlooked facts that would prompt reconsideration of a ruling.”).   

   Even if we were to consider the new information presented by VTB, it would not counsel 
granting the motion for reconsideration.  First, as the Court concluded in its February 27, 2025, 
order, “plaintiffs have waited more than three years for the production of these critical 
documents.  It would be unjust to require plaintiffs to wait any longer.”  Schansman, 2025 WL 
630810, at *19.  Second, while it may be “possible” that “additional time will lead to a result that 
could not have been obtained in the geopolitical environment that existed in 2024,” Mem. at 8, 
VTB has provided no evidence that would allow this Court to find that such a changed result is 
likely.  The Court is unwilling to delay production any further based on mere speculation.  
Finally, VTB’s argument that its case should track the claims against Sberbank — which are 
currently stayed — lacks force, since the stay was already in effect when plaintiffs moved to 
compel.  In any event, there is no reason to further delay discovery against VTB, given that 
plaintiffs have been seeking this material for years.‘ 
Il.    CONCLUSION 
    For the above reasons, VTB’s motion for reconsideration (Docket # 630) is denied and 
plaintiffs’ motion to strike (Docket # 633) is denied.

    *  Long after briefing on the motion for reconsideration was complete, VTB filed a letter 
suggesting that documents that are the subject of the motion to compel might be produced 
shortly.  See Letter, filed April 29, 2025 (Docket # 647).  Given VTB’s past record of inaccurate 
predictions about the timing of actions by Russian authorities, we give this letter no weight. 
Obviously, if the required documents are promptly produced, VTB will be free to argue that the 
production should affect the disposition of plaintiffs’ planned motion for sanctions.

GABRIEL W. GORENSTEIN, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE                     

The Court has considered the application of defendant VTB Bank (PJSC) (“VTB”) to 
seal or maintain redactions in a number of documents filed in connection with plaintiffs’ motion 
to compel (Docket # 593).1  VTB’s application seeks sealing of three types of information (1) 
names and account numbers of VTB account holders, (2) names of VTB employees and VTB’s 
consultant or consulting company, and (3) regulatory correspondence.      

As VTB acknowledges, see October 22, 2024, VTB Letter at 2, 3, the documents filed in 
connection with the motion to compel are “judicial documents” to which the presumption of 
public access attaches,” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006).  
The legal framework for our consideration of this application — particularly as relevant to 
discovery motions — is set forth in this Court’s decision in In re New York City Policing During 
Summer 2020 Demonstrations, 635 F. Supp. 3d 247, 251-254 (S.D.N.Y. 2022).  We incorporate 
by reference our discussion of those standards.  Having considered the parties’ arguments, we 
rule as to each category of documents as follows:                         

Regarding the names and account numbers of account holders, the Court finds that, in 
light of bank customers’ legitimate privacy interests, redacting the names and account numbers 
of non-parties does “not unduly interfere with the public's right to access judicial documents.”  
Olson v. Major League Baseball, 29 F.4th 59, 93 (2d Cir. 2022) (“a district court should consider 
its ability to use redactions that do not unduly interfere with the public's right to access judicial 
documents in order to address privacy concerns”).  However, we except from this ruling the 
names of the individuals already revealed in the Second Amended Complaint.  See, e.g., Second 
Amended Complaint filed October 5, 2020 (Docket # 156) ¶¶ 6, 7, 57, 151, 155, 158, 173, 217, 
233-34, 251-71.  These names have been public for years, there has been no application to seal 
any portions of the Second Amended Complaint, and even VTB’s own briefings contains some 

1  See VTB Bank PJSC’s Letter Request to Maintain Material Under Seal, filed October 
22, 2024 (Docket # 617) (“October 22, 2024, VTB Letter”); VTB Bank PJSC’s Letter Motion 
Regarding Sealing, filed October 28, 2024 (Docket # 620) (“October 28, 2024, VTB Letter”). 
of the account holders’ names at issue.  See VTB Bank PJSC’s Memoranum [sic] of Law in 
Opposition to Motion to Compel, filed September 20, 2024 (Docket # 606) at 15, 50.  Thus, 
redaction in any documents in the motion to compel briefing would not as a practical matter 
vindicate any privacy interests of these particular account holders.  Because these parties’ 
privacy interests are minimal, the public’s interest in understanding the parties’ arguments in the 
briefing of the motion to compel outweighs any such privacy interests. Thus any filings in 
support of the motion to compel may redact only the names of account holders not already 
named in the Second Amended Complaint.                                    

Regarding, the names of VTB employees and VTB’s consulting company and consultant, 
the Court recognizes the strong privacy interest of any individuals who did not make a choice to 
participate in this lawsuit.  However, any party that elected to represent VTB or contract with 
VTB with respect to this litigation has only the barest privacy interest, and that interest is 
outweighed by the public interest in the briefing on the motion to compel.  Thus, no redaction 
will be permitted of the name of the consultant hired by VTB to respond to plaintiffs’ document 
requests, the name of the company assisting VTB with its document review, and the names of 
VTB’s Russian attorneys.  The names of any other VTB employees in the filings, if any, may be 
redacted.                                                                 

With respect to regulatory correspondence, VTB contends that the “low presumption of 
public access is outweighed by the need to keep communications between VTB and the Ministry 
confidential.”  See October 22, 2024, VTB Letter at 2.  VTB argues that either the “bank 
examiner privilege” or “the concern underlying this privilege” applies in order to “protect[] the 
integrity of the regulatory process and ensure[] candor between VTB and the Ministry.”  Id.   

The Court rejects VTB’s argument for a number of reasons.  First, “the bank examination 
privilege belongs solely to . . . banking regulatory entities, and may not be asserted by third 
parties on behalf of the banking agencies.”  Wultz v. Bank of China Ltd., 61 F. Supp. 3d 272, 282 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citation omitted) (ellipses in original).  Second, the presumption does not apply 
to factual material but is instead meant to protect communications that further the goal of “the 
effective supervision of banks.”  Id. at 281; Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 
978 F. Supp. 2d 267, 277 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).  Here, the regulatory correspondence does not consist 
of any discussions relating to supervision of VTB but rather relates to the approval process for 
documents in this litigation.                                             

In any event, the Court finds that the concerns underlying this privilege do not outweigh 
the public right to access these documents.  VTB is asserting that it may permissibly not comply 
with valid U.S. discovery obligations because it has been blocked from doing so by Russian 
regulators.  The public’s right of access would be unduly impaired by obscuring the Russian 
regulators’ role in halting the production of documents.  Thus, there shall be no sealing or 
redaction of materials consisting of or relating to the regulatory correspondence.  
 Accordingly, the motion to seal (Docket #620) is granted in part and denied in part as set 
forth above.  Defendants are directed to refile by February 21, 2025, all memoranda of law, 
declarations, and other documents filed in connection with the motion to compel (Docket # 593) 
that currently contain redactions inconsistent with these rulings.  The name of each document 
that is refiled shall reference the original docket number of the document in its name (for 
example, “Exhibit A — former Docket 594”). 
 SO ORDERED.

ANDREW L. CARTER, JR., United States District Judge:                      
    Defendant VTB Bank (PJSC) (“VTB”) moves to certify for interlocutory appeal the 
Court’s September 30, 2021 Memorandum and Order (“Op.”) (ECF No. 185) denying 
Defendants’ motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) (ECF No. 156).  For 
the reasons that follow, VTB’s motion is DENIED.                          
                         BACKGROUND                                      
 On September 30, 2021, the Court denied Defendants’ motions to dismiss Plaintiffs’ SAC, 
finding, in part, that the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over VTB Bank and Sberbank 
for Plaintiffs’ claims. Op. at 1, 10.  On November 15, 2021, Defendants asked the Court both to 
reconsider its decision and to certify the order for interlocutory review, arguing, in relevant part, 
that the Court lacked personal jurisdiction over VTB and Sberbank of Russia.  ECF Nos. 210, 
213, 218, 220 (motions for reconsideration); ECF Nos. 215, 217, 222, 224 (pre-motion letters 
seeking certification for interlocutory appeal).                          
 On September 16, 2022, following the appearance of replacement counsel and pursuant to 
VTB’s request, the Court dismissed VTB’s motion for reconsideration and pre-motion letter for 
interlocutory appeal filed by previous counsel and granted VTB leave to submit new filings. ECF 
No. 435. Shortly thereafter, on September 30, 2022, the Court denied Sberbank of Russia’s 
motion to reconsider and request to certify the Court’s order denying Sberbank’s motion to 
dismiss for interlocutory appeal. ECF No. 439.                            
 On October 7, 2022, VTB filed a pre-motion letter seeking to renew its prior request to 
certify the September 30, 2021 order for interlocutory review. ECF No. 441. On June 21, 2023, 

the Court held a status hearing and pre-motion conference, where it permitted VTB to file a 
motion to certify that order for interlocutory appeal, but denied VTB’s (1) motion for 
reconsideration, ECF No. 442; (2) request to file a motion for summary judgment, ECF No. 498, 
without prejudice to VTB renewing that request after the close of discovery, June 2021 Tr. at 
18:1-4; and (3) request for supplemental briefing, ECF No. 513, to discuss the purported 
relevance of the Supreme Court’s decision in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 143 S. Ct. 1206 (2023). 
See ECF No. 520.  As the Court explained with respect to VTB’s motion for reconsideration, 
“[i]n evaluating defendant’s original motion to dismiss, the Court carefully evaluated the facts 
alleged in the amended complaint as to each defendant and found that plaintiffs had articulated a 
prima facie case [of personal jurisdiction] against VTB.”  June 21, 2023 Tr. 8:18-23.  The Court 

reaffirmed its ruling that the allegations in the SAC establish jurisdiction over VTB under 
Second Circuit and New York precedent, including under Daou v. BLC Bank, S.A.L., 42 F.4th 
120 (2d. Cir. 2022). Id. at 10:11- 21.                                    
 VTB filed its motion for certification on July 19, 2023.  ECF Nos. 524, 525, 526.  Plaintiffs 
filed their memorandum in opposition on August 16, 2023.  ECF No. 531.  VTB filed a reply in 
further support of its motion on August 30, 2023.  ECF No. 532.  VTB has since submitted three 
notices of supplemental authority (ECF Nos. 536, 537, 538) to which Plaintiffs replied (ECF No. 
No. 539).                                                                 
                       STANDARD OF REVIEW                                
    A district court has authority to certify an order for interlocutory appeal when “such order 
involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of 
opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate 
termination of the litigation.”  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  Given the general policy of deferring 

appellate review until after the entry of a final judgment, interlocutory review is granted only in 
“exceptional circumstances.”  In re Flor, 79 F.3d 281, 284 (2d Cir. 1996) (citation and quotation 
marks omitted).  Movants cannot invoke the appellate process as a vehicle to provide early 
review of difficult rulings in hard cases.  Only “exceptional circumstances” will justify a 
departure from the basic policy of avoiding appellate review until a final decision on the merits.  
In re Ambac Fin. Group, Inc. Sec. Litig., 693 F.Supp.2d 241, 282 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (internal 
quotations and citations omitted).                                        
 "The party seeking an interlocutory appeal has the burden of showing [these] 'exceptional 
circumstances' to 'overcome the general aversion to piecemeal litigation.'" In re Perry H. Koplik 
& Sons, Inc., 377 B.R. 69, 73 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro, 921 

F.2d 21, 24 (2d Cir. 1990)).  The determination of whether a party has carried this burden is 
"committed to the discretion of the district court."  Harriscom Svenska AB v. Harris Corp., 947 
F.2d 627, 629 (2d Cir. 1991).                                             
                           DISCUSSION                                    
 VTB has failed to establish the exceptional circumstances necessary to certify an 
interlocutory appeal.  Moreover, it has failed to establish that (1) the Court’s decision on 
personal jurisdiction involves a “controlling question of law,” (2) a “substantial ground for 
difference of opinion” exists, or (3) an immediate appeal “may materially advance the ultimate 
termination of the litigation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).                      
 I.   Controlling Question of Law                                        
 VTB has not shown the “exceptional circumstances” to change the Court’s prior ruling, or to 
move to the appellate process without further proceedings at the district court.  "To satisfy the 
first criterion of Section 1292(b), the movant must demonstrate that the question is both 

controlling and a question of law.  In re Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., No. 18-CV-8986-VEC, 
2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77887, 2019 WL 2023723, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2019).  “A 
‘controlling question’ must be a 'pure' question of law that the reviewing court 'could decide 
quickly and cleanly without having to study the record.'" Id. The mixed questions of law and fact 
concerning VTB’s conduct and its connection with New York’s financial system are not suitable 
for appellate review without a full record.  See In re Worldcom, Inc., 2003 WL 21498904, at *10 
(S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2003) (§1292(b) appeal requires “a ‘pure’ question of law that the reviewing 
court ‘could decide quickly and cleanly without having to study the record’”).  
 In fact, this Court has reviewed the factual allegations set forth in the Second Amended 
Complaint and has determined on three separate occasions that Plaintiffs have sufficiently 

pleaded a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction. Op. at 7-10; ECF No. 439 at 3-4; June 21, 
2023 Tr. at 13-14.  Plaintiffs have alleged that VTB and Sberbank operated correspondent 
accounts in New York, routed U.S. Dollar dominated transactions to or on behalf of the DPR 
through these New York based correspondent accounts, and processed transfers for fundraisers 
supporting the DPR. SAC ¶¶ 27, 56, 177-332.  See Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian 
Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161, 168 (2d Cir. 2013) (finding in ATA case that specific jurisdiction was 
proper when a bank “deliberately chose to process . . . wire transfers . . . in New York” when 
“[i]n light of the widespread acceptance and availability of U.S. currency, [the bank] could have . 
. . processed U.S.-dollar-denominated wire transfers . . . through correspondent accounts 
anywhere in the world.”).                                                 
 Despite VTB’s suggestion that the Second Circuit could “review the September 30, 2021 
Order quickly and cleanly, with no need to study a factual record,” determining whether a 

defendant transacted business in the state sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction "necessarily 
requires examination of the particular facts in each case."  Daou v. BLC Bank, S.A.L., 42 F.4th 
120, 129 (2d. Cir. 2022) (quoting Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL ("Licci I"), 20 N.Y.3d 
327, 338 (2d Cir. 2012)).  VTB fails to meet the standard for “controlling question of law” ripe 
for appellate review.                                                     
 II.  Substantial Ground for Difference of Opinion                       
    VTB fails to show that there exists a “substantial ground for difference of opinion” on the 
question of law. 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  The requirement that such a substantial ground for a 
difference of opinion exists may be met when "(1) there is conflicting authority on the issue, or 
(2) the issue is particularly difficult and of first impression for the Second Circuit."  Enron Corp. 

v. Springfield Assocs., L.L.C. (In re Enron Corp.), 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70731, *6-7 
(S.D.N.Y., Sept. 24, 2007) (citing Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione 
Motonave Achille Lauro in Amministrazione Straordinaria, 921 F.2d 21 (2d Cir. 1990)).  Neither 
of these factors is present in the instant case.                          
    VTB argues that proceeding with this case goes against the weight of authority, in part 
because the Second Circuit’s decision in Daou v. BLC Bank, S.A.L., 42 F.4th 120 (2d Cir. 2022) 
compels a finding that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over VTB because the Complaint 
does not allege a “direct” and “substantial” connection between the alleged jurisdictional 
contacts and the claims asserted by Plaintiffs.  ECF No. 525 at 2-3, 10-12.  Again, VTB’s 
arguments miss the mark.                                                  
    The Court’s decision on the motion to dismiss is entirely consistent with Daou, where the 
Second Circuit reaffirmed the principle that New York’s long arm statute is “a ‘single act 

statute,’ and ‘proof of one transaction in New York is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction, even 
though the defendant never enters New York, so long as the defendant’s activities here were 
purposeful and there is a substantial relationship between the transaction and the claim 
asserted.’”  Daou v. BLC Bank, S.A.L., 42 F.4th at 129.  Although in Daou, the Second Circuit 
affirmed the district court’s finding that the plaintiffs’ claims did not arise from the defendant 
bank’s transaction in New York, that is not the case here.                
    In Daou, the Second Circuit expressly stated that “[a] claim may arise from the use of a 
correspondent bank account for purposes of § 302(a)(1) where an alleged actual transaction 
made through such an account formed part of the alleged unlawful course of conduct underlying 
the cause of action set out in the complaint.”  Daou, 42 F.4th at 130.  These are precisely the 

allegations here, where Plaintiffs allege that VTB used its New York correspondent account to 
transfer money to the DPR to help fund their alleged terrorist activities, resulting in the tragic 
aircraft crash at issue in this litigation.  SAC ¶¶ 27, 342-361.          
    At issue in Daou was the commercial banks’ refusal to send funds through U.S. 
correspondent accounts such that there was no substantial nexus between the commercial banks’ 
use of their correspondent accounts and the Daous’ claims.  Id. at 131. The fact that the Plaintiffs 
“did not include a single allegation that any defendant used an actual, specific transaction 
through a New York correspondent account in the course of bringing about the injuries on which 
the claims are predicated” destroyed any finding of personal jurisdiction.  Id. at 132.  Instead, the 
Daous’ jurisdictional hook, that the requested wire transfers likely would have been routed 
through the New York correspondent accounts if the commercial banks had not refused those 
requests, failed because it was “not only highly speculative” but also supplied “no connection 
whatsoever, much less a substantial one, between the claims and any actual transaction.” Id.  

Unlike the Daous, Plaintiffs in this case have factually alleged actual, specific transactions routed 
through VTB’s New York based correspondent account which provided direct funding to the 
DPR.  SAC ¶¶ 61, 177-332.                                                 
    Daou and its progeny have not altered the legal landscape of personal jurisdiction 
analysis such that the issue VTB seeks to certify on appeal is one in which there is conflicting 
authority, or that this is an issue of first impression.  Courts in this District have interpreted Daou 
to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction claims in which commercial banks, similar to those in 
Daou, refused to wire funds through New York based correspondent accounts.  See, e.g., Kreit v. 
Byblos Bank S.A.L., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189468, *15-16 (S.D.N.Y., Oct. 22, 2023) (citing 
Elghossain v. Bank Audi S.A.L., 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30631 (S.D.N.Y., Feb. 23, 2023), report 

and recommendation adopted by 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175684; Moussaoui v. Bank of Beirut & 
the Arab Countries, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163283 (S.D.N.Y., Sept. 14, 2023)).  No such refusal 
exists here.                                                              
    Despite VTB’s assertion that this new authority either requires the Court to sua sponte 
revisit its previous decisions or ripens its request to certify the Court’s September 2021 Order for 
interlocutory appeal, the Court’s finding of personal jurisdiction is only affirmed by recent 
precedent.  ECF Nos. 536, 537, 538.  The plaintiffs in Kreit, Elghossain, and Moussaoui all 
failed to allege that Defendant banks “used an actual, specific transaction through a New York 
correspondent account in the course of bringing about the injuries on which the claims are 
predicated.” Kreit, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189468 at *17-18; Elghossain, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
30631 at *30-31; Moussaoui, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163283 at *14-15.  “Indeed, where 
courts have found personal jurisdiction over defendant banks . . . they have concluded that the 
defendant banks' correspondent accounts were used to transmit money to terrorist organizations 

via specific, documented, and knowing transactions.”  Moussaoui, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
163283, *15-16.  This case is much more analogous to Licci I, where the Second Circuit found in 
an Anti-Terrorism Act action that the pleadings established the “articulable nexus” or 
“substantial relationship” necessary for purposes of personal jurisdiction when they alleged that 
the defendant’s use of its New York account to transfer money provided funds to carry out 
terrorist violence. Licci I, 20 N.Y.3d at 340;                            
    Courts in this Circuit are decidedly in agreement of how to interpret Daou and its 
application to speculative, hypothetical transactions that fail to satisfy § 302(a)(1)'s arise-from 
requirement.  And the issue VTB aims to certify for interlocutory appeal has been resolved by 
the Circuit’s decision in Licci over a decade prior.  Licci I, 20 N.Y.3d at 340 (noting that 

repeated routing of a transfer for a terrorist group was not coincidental, but an articulable nexus 
or substantial relationship between the transaction and the claims asserted).  Thus, it is not an 
issue of first impression.  VTB fails to show that there exists a substantial ground for difference 
of opinion.                                                               
 III.  Materially Advance Termination of Litigation                      
 Certification would prolong rather than “materially advance the ultimate termination of th[is] 
litigation.”  28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  Material advancement occurs when an appeal "promises to 
advance the time for trial or shorten the time required therefor." In re Terrorist Attacks on 
September 11, 2001, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66886, *12 (S.D.N.Y., Apr. 17, 2023) (citation 
omitted).  This factor, in which courts place “particular weight,” focuses on the "institutional 
efficiency of both the district court and the appellate court," Tantaros v. Fox News Network, 
LLC, 465 F. Supp. 3d 385, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (citation omitted), because "efficiency of the 
federal court system is among the chief concerns underlying Section 1292(b)," SLE.C. v. Credit 
Bancorp, Ltd., 103 F.Supp.2d 223, 226 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). 
   VTB’s argument about the potential complexity of discovery does not warrant further delay 
in the adjudication of this case and is not a ground for interlocutory appeal. ECF No. 525 at 12- 
13.  Although discovery has been underway for over two years, only 239 of over 7,000 estimated 
documents have been produced to Plaintiffs.  ECF No. 560.  Such enormous delays in production 
have had “a severe and negative impact on the progress of this case.”  ECF No. 509 at 1.  This 
case has already been stalled by the restrictions that Russian law places on VTB in connection 
with discovery; it should not be thwarted any further by appellate certification. 

                                 CONCLUSION 

   Because VTB fails to establish the exceptional circumstances necessary to certify an 
interlocutory appeal, VTB’s motion to certify (ECF No. 524) is DENIED. 

   The Clerk of Court is directed to close the open motion at ECF No. 524.  The Parties are 
ordered to file a joint status report on or before April 11, 2024.

 In conjunction with the briefing of the plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel (Docket # 478), the 
Court is in receipt of applications from parties to this case to maintain under seal memoranda and 
exhibits containing information defendant VTB Bank PJSC (“VTB”) has designated confidential 
pursuant to a protective order in this case.  See Docket ## 477, 493, 496. 
 We previously delineated the governing standard in In re New York City Policing During 
Summer 2020 Demonstrations, 2022 WL 7886182 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2022).  In applying the 
applicable three-part test here, we recognize first that these documents filed with the Court to 
brief the plaintiffs’ discovery motion are necessarily “judicial documents” to which a 
presumption of access attaches.  Id. at *1 (citing Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 
110, 119-120 (2d Cir. 2006)).  However, in discovery disputes, the weight of the presumption is 
not strong.  See id. at 2.  VTB has identified the “inherently sensitive” nature of communications 
between regulators and the entities they regulate (persuasively likening its situation to domestic 
“bank examination privilege” and discussing the interest in “the integrity of the regulatory 
process”).  Docket # 496 at 1-2. 
 Because the weight of the presumption in this context is low, VTB has identified a 
substantial argument in favor of its sealing, and the applications are unopposed, we find that the 
burden has been carried in favor of sealing.  Thus, we grant the applications at Docket ## 477, 
493, and 496 to maintain under seal the redacted portions of the memoranda and exhibits 
referenced in those applications.  The documents are already sealed and thus no action by the 
Clerk is required.

GABRIEL W. GORENSTEIN, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE 
  Regarding plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel defendant VTB Bank PSJC (“VTB”) to produce 
documents (Docket # 478), the documents were first requested by plaintiffs in November 2021, 
more than 17 months ago (see Docket # 479 at 5).  The delay in production has had a severe and 
negative impact on the progress of this case.  The Court has considered the arguments of 
defendants regarding the reasons for delay and the need for additional time, and directs VTB to 
produce the requested documents to plaintiffs no later than November 30, 2023.  VTB shall 
produce any documents available before that date as soon as the documents are available. 
  If VTB fails to produce to plaintiff all documents by November 30, 2023, the Court shall 
deem such failure to constitute a refusal to produce the documents on the grounds of the 
operation of foreign law.  The Court will then decide the consequences of that refusal in 
accordance with the principles articulated in case law.  See, e.g., Societe Nationale Industrielle 
Aerospatiale v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for S. Dist. of lowa,  483 U.S. 522, 543-45 (1987);  Wultz  _v. 
Bank of China Ltd., 298 F.R.D. 91, 96 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). 
  Also, if the documents have not been produced in full by November 30, 2023, plaintiffs 
shall inform the Court within 7 days and may supplement the motion to compel with any further 
information relevant to the motion.  VTB may file its response within 7 days thereafter. 
  VTB shall file a report on the status of (1) its transmission of documents to the relevant 
government entities for review, including but not limited to the Russian Ministry of Finance; (2) 
the approval process by the relevant governmental entities; (3) any actual production it has made 
to plaintiffs; and (4) any other information VTB deems relevant to the motion to compel.  The 
first such report shall be filed on or before June 12, 2023.  Updated reports shall be filed by the 
following dates: July 12, 2023; August 14, 2023; September 12, 2023; October 12, 2023; and 
November 13, 2023. 
  VTB is to provide information to plaintiffs as requested regarding the above matters as 
well as regarding VTB’s search for responsive documents.

ANDREW L. CARTER, JR., United States District Judge:                      
    Defendant Sberbank of Russia submits a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Second Amended 
Complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject-matter 
jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) and the Anti-Terrorism Act 
(ATA). For the following reasons, Sberbank’s motion to dismiss is denied. 

                        I.  BACKGROUND                                   
    I assume the parties’ familiarity with the facts, which are set forth more fully in the 
Memorandum and Order denying Defendants’ previous motion to dismiss. ECF No. 185. In short, 
according  to  the  original  complaint  and  Second  Amended  Complaint  (“SAC”),  Defendants 
Sberbank and VTB Bank provided material support and financing to the Donetsk People’s 
Republic, a terrorist group accused of downing a Malaysia Airlines flight over Eastern Ukraine in 
2014.                                                                     

                    II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW                              
    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) allows for dismissal of a complaint for “lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction.” The Second Circuit has held that a motion to dismiss for one of the 
non-waivable defenses under Rule 12(h) (such as lack of subject matter jurisdiction, at FRCP 
12(h)(3)), is valid even after the answer is filed and should be construed as a motion for judgment 
on the pleadings under Rule 12(c). Patel v. Contemporary Classics of Beverly Hills, 259 F.3d 123, 
126 (2d Cir. 2001). Further, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (“If the court determines at any time 

that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.”) 

                        III.  DISCUSSION                                 
 A.  SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY CLAIMS                                           
    The FSIA “is the sole source for subject matter jurisdiction over any action against a 
foreign state.” Pablo Star Ltd. v. Welsh Government, 378 F. Supp. 3d 300, 306 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)  
    As Sberbank noted in the Joint Status Report of Sept 13, 2022 at ECF No. 434: a sovereign 
defendant’s waiver of immunity must “be ‘unmistakable’ and ‘unambiguous.’” Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Grp. Inc. v. Comm. of Receivers for Galadari, 12 F.3d 317, 326 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting 
Shapiro v. Republic of Bolivia, 930 F.2d 1013, 1017 (2d Cir. 1991)). Here, although Sberbank 

repeatedly disclaimed sovereign immunity defenses at earlier stages of briefing, they raised the 
defense in the first paragraph of their answer to the second amended complaint. ECF No. 226. 
Therefore, the Court does not consider the question of whether Sberbank waived sovereign 
immunity at this time, and examines the merits of Sberbank’s sovereign immunity defense. 
    The FSIA provides immunity to foreign states as well as to any “agency or instrumentality” 
of  a  foreign  state. 28  U.S.C.  §  1603(a); 28  U.S.C.  §  1604.  The  FSIA  defines  “agency  or 
instrumentality” as an entity:                                            
    (1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and    
    (2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of 
      whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political 
      subdivision thereof, and                                           
    (3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States as defined in section 1332(c) 

      and (e) of this title, nor created under the laws of any third country. 
28 U.S.C. § 1603(b).                                                      
    The FSIA provides that “a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts 
of the United States and of the States” unless one of the limited exceptions enumerated in Sections 
1605 through 1607 of the FSIA applies. 28 U.S.C. § 1604; see Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 
349, 355 (1993); Pablo Star Ltd., 378 F. Supp.3d at 306. “When [a] defendant claims immunity 
under the FSIA and ‘presents a prima facie case that it is a foreign sovereign, the plaintiff has the 
burden of going forward with evidence showing that, under exceptions to the FSIA, immunity 
should not be granted, although the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with the alleged foreign 
sovereign.’” Figueroa v. Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, 222 F. Supp. 3d 304, 307 

(S.D.N.Y. 2016) (quoting Cargill Int'l S.A. v. M/T Pavel Dybenko, 991 F.2d 1012, 1016 (2d Cir. 
1993)).                                                                   
    Determining  whether  a  plaintiff  has  satisfied  his  burden  “involves  a  review  of  the 
allegations in the complaint, the undisputed facts, if any, placed before the court by the parties, 
and—if the plaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to carry its burden of production on 
this issue—resolution of disputed issues of facts.” Anglo-Iberia Underwriting Mgmt. v. P.T. 
Jamsostek, 600 F.3d 171, 175 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting In re Terrorist Attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, 
538 F.3d 71, 80 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). At this stage, 
“when considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of 
sovereign immunity, ‘the Court generally must accept the material factual allegations in the 
complaint as true, but does not draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.’” Pablo Star 
Ltd., 378 F. Supp. 3d at 306, quoting Figueroa, 222 F. Supp. 3d at 307. “[W]here jurisdictional 
facts are disputed, the Court has the power and obligation to consider matters outside the pleadings, 

such as affidavits, documents, and testimony, to determine whether jurisdiction exists.” Figueroa, 
222 F. Supp. 3d at 307.                                                   
    Sberbank claims they have qualified as an “agency or instrumentality” of Russia since at 
least April 2020, because at that time, the Ministry of Finance of Russia became the majority 
shareholder of Sberbank. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Sberbank’s Motion to Dismiss 
for Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“Sberbank 
FSIA Memo” at ECF 258) at 4. Sberbank also claims that they were in fact an “agency or 
instrumentality” before April 30, 2020 “by virtue of [Sberbank’s] direct majority ownership by the 
Central Bank of the Russian Federation (“Bank of Russia”).” ECF 258 at 12-13. 
    However, as Chief Justice Marshall once wrote, “[w]here there is no change of party, a 

jurisdiction depending on the condition of the party, is governed by that condition as it was at the 
commencement of the suit.” Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. 556, 565 (1829) (Marshall, C.J.) 
    The Supreme Court and the Second Circuit have agreed with the venerable Chief Justice 
in this regard, and have held that the determination of “agency or instrumentality” status is made 
at the time of the filing of suit. In Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 478 (2003), the 
Supreme Court stated, “We think the plain text [of § 1603(b)(2)], because it is expressed in the 
present tense, requires that instrumentality status be determined at the time suit is filed.” The Court 
grounded its holding in “the longstanding principle that ‘the jurisdiction of the Court depends upon 
the state of things at the time of the action brought.’” Id.; see also Bartlett v. Societe Generale de 
Banque au Liban SAL, 2021 WL 3706909, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 6, 2021) The Second Circuit has 
followed the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dole, stating that it “unequivocally [holds] that an entity’s 
status as an instrumentality of a foreign state should be determined at the time of the filing of the 
complaint[.]” Abrams v. Societe Nationale Des Chemins De Fer Francais, 389 F.3d 61, 64 (2d 

Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 975.                                   
    Therefore, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation’s acquisition of direct 
majority ownership of Sberbank as of April 30, 2020 is not at issue, and the Court does not consider 
whether this would confer “agency or instrumentality” status on Sberbank.  
    In turn, the Court now must examine Sberbank’s argument that in fact, they were an 
“agency or instrumentality” of the Russian Federation before April 30, 2020 “by virtue of 
[Sberbank’s] direct majority ownership by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (“Bank of 
Russia”).” ECF 258 at 12-13.                                              

 B.  SBERBANK’S STATUS BEFORE ITS ACQUISITION BY THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE 

    Sberbank states that on April 4, 2019 (the date the original complaint was filed, ECF No. 
1), Sberbank was directly, majority-owned by the Bank of Russia. See Tsvetkov Decl. ¶¶ 3-4 (“As 
of 4 April 2019 . . . the Bank of Russia (also called the Central Bank of Russia) owned a 50% plus 
one share stake of Sberbank’s total authorized capital.”); Tsvetkov Decl. Ex. A (Certificate from 
the Register of Securities Owners about Shareholders Holding One and More % of the Charter 
Capital as at 4 April 2019); id. Ex. B (excerpt from Sberbank’s 2019 Annual Report). As such, 
Sberbank claims that they have been an “agency or instrumentality” of Russia all along, and are 
exempt from suit.                                                         
    Plaintiffs contend that Sberbank was an “entity owned by an ‘agency or instrumentality’ at 
the time of filing,” and therefore Sberbank is not entitled to a presumption of immunity. See 
Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Sberbank of Russia PJSC’s Second Motion to 
Dismiss the Second Amended Complaint (“Pls.’ Opp.” at ECF No. 312) at 10. 

    If the Bank of Russia is an agency or instrumentality, then it is unlikely that Sberbank can 
also be one, as the Supreme Court has held that the chain of sovereign immunity does not extend 
beyond a direct link to a sovereign entity. (“We hold that only direct ownership of a majority of 
shares by the foreign state satisfies the statutory requirement.” Dole Food Co. v Patrickson, 538 
US 468, 474 (2003), emphasis added). Sberbank would then be subject to suit, without any need 
for further analysis of sovereign immunity.                               
    In contrast, if Bank of Russia is a political subdivision, then Sberbank could be an agency 
or instrumentality majority owned by it, and thus covered by sovereign immunity. 
    The Court holds that 1) the Central Bank of Russia is a “political subdivision” of the 
Russian government, 2) Sberbank is an agency or instrumentality of the Russian government, 

and, crucially, 3) Sberbank is still subject to suit under the commercial-activity exception to the 
FSIA.                                                                     

 C.  APPLYING THE SECOND CIRCUIT’S CORE FUNCTIONS TEST, CENTRAL BANK OF  
    RUSSIA QUALIFIES AS A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION                          
    Courts within the Second Circuit use the “core functions test” from Garb v. Republic of 
Poland, 440 F.3d 579 (2d Cir. 2006) to decide whether an entity is a “political subdivision” or an 
“agency or instrumentality” of a state. The test examines whether the “core functions” of the 
entity “are predominantly governmental or commercial.” Garb v. Republic of Poland, 440 F.3d 
579, 594 (2d Cir. 2006). “If an entity’s core functions are predominantly governmental, then it is 
a political subdivision. If the entity’s core functions are predominantly commercial, then it is an 
agency or instrumentality.” NML Capital Ltd. v. Space Expl. Techs. Corp., No. 14-cv-2262, 2015 
WL 1334291, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 6, 2015) (citing Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 333 F.3d 

228, 234 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).                                               
    Here, Bank of Russia’s core functions are predominantly governmental. As noted in the 
Sberbank FSIA Memo, the Bank of Russia is a crucial market regulator within the Russian 
System. The Constitution of the Russian Federation states that the Bank of Russia is 
“exclusively” responsible for the issuance of rubles, and that “protecting and ensuring the 
stability of the ruble shall be the core function of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation[.]” 
Art. 75 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation; Decl. of Lyudmila G. Efimova ¶ 6. 
Further, the Bank of Russia is to exercise these duties “independently from other state power 
bodies.” Id. Along with its currency stabilization role, “[t]he Bank of Russia formulates 
economic policy in coordination with other branches of government and possesses wide 

regulatory authority, including the issuance of legal normative acts and the imposition of 
administrative fines.” Sberbank FSIA Memo at 14. Its governmental functions include acting as 
a last-resort creditor, setting the rules to conduct banking operations, managing the gold and 
currency reserves of the Russian Government, regulating the Russian banking and financial 
sectors, setting the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the ruble, and compiling various 
official statistics used in the forecasting and public communication of Russian economic policy. 
Efimova Decl. ¶ 8. These activities are all quintessentially governmental, and in line with the 
work of central banks in other countries. Therefore, the Court holds that the Bank of Russia is a 
“political subdivision” of the Russian government.                        
 D.  SBERBANK IS AN AGENCY OR INSTRUMENTALITY OF RUSSIA                  
    As discussed above, under the “core functions” test from Garb, the Bank of Russia is a 
political subdivision. Its core functions – regulating the Russian economy, maintaining the value 
of the Ruble, and overseeing Russian banks are predominantly governmental. Because Bank of 

Russia is a political subdivision of Russia, Sberbank is presumptively covered by sovereign 
immunity because it is majority owned by it. See e.g., Dole Food Co. v Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 
477 (2003) (“A corporation is an instrumentality of a foreign state under the FSIA only if the 
foreign state itself owns a majority of the corporation's shares.”)       
    Sberbank’s submissions show that Sberbank is majority owned by the Bank of Russia. 
See, e.g., Oleg Tsvetkov Decl. ¶ 3: “As of 4 April 2019 . . . the Bank of Russia (also called the 
Central Bank of Russia) owned a 50% plus one share stake of Sberbank’s total authorized 
capital.”). Under §1603(b)(2) of the FSIA, Sberbank is then an entity “a majority of whose 
shares . . . [are] owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,” and therefore qualifies 
as an agency or instrumentality of the State of Russia.                   


 E.  SBERBANK MAY STILL BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THE COMMERCIAL-ACTIVITY     
    EXCEPTION TO THE FSIA                                                
    Sberbank argues that by virtue of its status as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign 
state, it is presumptively immune from suit. Sberbank FSIA Memo at 3. Having determined that 
the 1) the Bank of Russia is a political subdivision, and 2) Sberbank is an agency or 
instrumentality of Russia, the Court next must decide whether an exception to sovereign 
immunity applies to Sberbank. The Court holds that the commercial-activity exception applies in 
this case, and Sberbank is thus subject to suit.                          
    When considering an exception to the FSIA, Plaintiff carries the burden “of going 
forward with evidence showing that, under exceptions to the FSIA, immunity should not be 
granted.” Freund v. Republic of France, 592 F. Supp. 2d 540, 552-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting 
Cabiri v. Republic of Ghana, 165 F.3d 193, 196 (2d Cir. 1999)). Once Plaintiff satisfies this 

burden of production, the burden of persuasion passes to Defendants to show that an exception to 
the FSIA does not apply. Freund, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 552-53 (providing that “the ultimate burden 
of persuasion remains with the alleged foreign sovereign”); Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. v. 
Islamic Republic of Iran, 734 F.3d 1175, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 2013).           
    Section 1605(a)(2) of FSIA, the statute's commercial activity exception, provides that “[a] 
foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the 
States in any case” in which the action is based upon (1) “a commercial activity carried on in the 
United States by the foreign state”; (2) “upon an act performed in the United States in connection 
with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere”; or (3) “upon an act outside the territory 
of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and 

that act causes a direct effect in the United States.” To fall within the commercial activity 
exception, [Defendant’s] activities need to qualify for at least one of the categories specified in the 
three clauses of §1605(a)(2). United States v. Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S., 16 F.4th 336, 348 (2d 
Cir. 2021) (hereinafter, “Halkbank”).                                     
    As the Second Circuit stated in Halkbank, the commercial activity inquiry begins with 
identifying an act that is based upon the particular conduct that constitutes the ‘gravamen’ of the 
suit.” Id.; see also Barnet as Tr. Of 2012 Saretta Barnet Revocable Trust v. Ministry of Culture 
and Sports of the Hellenic Republic, 961 F.3d at 200 (“We first must identify [the] predicate act 
that serves as the basis for plaintiff's claims.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).  
    Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleges that Sberbank provided material 
support and financing to the DPR (SAC ¶ 79), in part by operating correspondent accounts in New 
York (SAC ¶¶ 58-59), and by allowing transfers to a specific Sberbank bank card (SAC ¶¶ 317, 
318). The money raised through these transfers then allowed the DPR and its senior leadership to 

procure lethal weapons. SAC ¶¶ 293, 296-305. This conduct constitutes the “gravamen” of the 
allegations against Sberbank, and the conduct related to the correspondent banks in New York 
took place in the United States.                                          
    The FSIA provides that “the commercial character of an activity shall be determined by 
reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by 
reference to its purpose.” 28 U.S.C. § 1603(d). The Second Circuit has held that “purpose is the 
reason why the foreign state engages in the activity and nature is the outward form of the conduct 
that the foreign state performs or agrees to perform. Put another way, the issue is whether the 
particular actions that the foreign state performs . . . are the type of actions by which a private party 
engages in trade and traffic or commerce.” Halkbank, 26 F.4th at 349 (other emphases and internal 

quotation marks omitted).                                                 
    Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that Sberbank and the other defendants provided material 
support and financing to the DPR. SAC ¶ 79. The DPR used Defendants’ services to raise money 
and advertised ways to donate money to accounts or bank cards associated with Defendants 
Sberbank and VTB Bank. SAC ¶¶ 143-150. Media outlets reported that Sberbank facilitated 
payments to soldiers to assist Russian Separatists in East Ukraine. SAC ¶¶ 167-169. Further, the 
DPR  published  online  detailed  ledgers  reflecting  the  funds  that  the  DPR  received  using 
Defendants’ services, and the DPR also detailed how the funds were used to purchase equipment 
and weaponry “necessary for the DPR’s terrorist activities.” Id. at ¶¶ 179-180. A senior leader of 
the DPR indicated that transfers could be made to a specific Sberbank bank card or via Western 
Union and solicited funds through transfers utilizing Sberbank and other defendants. SAC ¶¶ 317, 
318. Plaintiffs also allege that prior to the attack on MH17, the DPR provided instructions on how 
to send transfers in U.S. Dollars to Sberbank and VTB Bank’s correspondent accounts in New 

York. Id. at ¶¶ 58-59.                                                    
    The  use  of  correspondent  accounts  and  authorization  of  money  transfers  is  classic 
commercial behavior for an international bank and does not qualify as sovereign conduct. A bank 
that is acting in a commercial manner, as Sberbank is alleged to have done, is not presumptively 
excused from suit. As the Supreme Court has held, “when a foreign government acts, not as 
regulator of a market, but in the manner of a private player within it, the foreign sovereign's actions 
are ‘commercial’ within the meaning of the FSIA.” Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 
U.S. 607, 614 (1992). Therefore, the first two clauses of §1605(a)(2) are satisfied, and the defense 
of sovereign immunity is denied.                                          


 F. ALTERNATE GROUNDS OF DISMISSAL UNDER THE ATA                         
    As stated in the Supreme Court’s decision, Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677,
691 (2004), “courts should decide claims of sovereign immunity in conformity with [FSIA’s] 
principles.” Because of this, courts have regarded “an assertion of sovereign immunity under the 
ATA as being functionally equivalent to an assertion of sovereign immunity under the FSIA.” 
Ungar v. Palestinian Liberation Org., 402 F.3d 274, 283 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal citation omitted); 
e.g., Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Org., 583 F.Supp.2d. 451, 457 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (“The ATA's
exclusion, of foreign states and governmental actors from its coverage, is consistent with, and to 
be applied in accordance with, the ordinary sovereign immunity principles codified in the FSIA.”), 
vacated on different grounds sub nom. Waldman v. Palestinian Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317 (2d 
Cir. 2016). Sberbank’s argument to read the ATA’s sovereign immunity provision more broadly 
than the FSIA are thus counter to the practice of the federal courts. For that reason, Sberbank’s 
motion to dismiss under the ATA’s sovereign immunity provision is denied. 

                            IV.    CONCLUSION 
     For the reasons set forth above, Sberbank’s second motion to dismiss is denied. The parties 
are to continue with discovery and proceedings before Judge Gorenstein’s Chambers. 

SO ORDERED.

— Plaintiffs’ Letter Motion to File Under Seal Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant VTB Bank 
PJSC’s Renewed Motion for Reconsideration 

Dear Judge Carter: 
     Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) and Your Honor’s Individual Practice 
Rule 6.D, Plaintiffs respectfully move the Court for leave to file under seal the unredacted version 
of  Plaintiffs’  Opposition  to  Defendant  VTB  Bank  PJSC’s  (*VTB”)  Renewed  Motion  for 
Reconsideration.  See ECF Nos. 442-44.  In support of this motion, Plaintiffs state as follows: 
  1.  The above-listed filing contains references to material that a non-party has designated as 
     confidential pursuant to the Protective Order in this case.  ECF No. 294.  Accordingly, 
     pursuant to the Protective Order, id., Plaintiffs have provisionally filed the above listed 
     filing under seal. 
  2.  Courts in the Second Circuit have recognized that for material produced in discovery, such 
     as the material that Plaintiffs  seek to file under seal,  “the public interest in access  to 
     discovery materials is recognized as generally of a limited order.”  Byrnes v. Empire Blue 
     Cross Blue Shield, No. 98 CIV. 8520 BSJ MHD, 2000 WL 60221, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 
     2000).  A court may keep documents or portions of documents under seal if there is “good 
     cause for preventing public access to discovery materials.”  Id. 
  3.  Here, a third-party financial institution that produced records in response to a subpoena 
     served by Plaintiffs has designated information contained in the filing as confidential, as 
     the information concerns the bank records of the third party’s customers who transferred 
     funds  through  VTB’s  New  York  correspondent  bank.   Under  the  Protective  Order, 
     Plaintiffs are required to file these materials under seal in any court filing.  ECF No. 294 
     {| 13. This presents a legitimate concern of confidentiality and gives good cause to file 
     under seal.

Dear Judge Carter: 
     Plaintiffs respectfully move the Court for leave to file under seal pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 26(c) and Your Honor’s  Individual Practice Rule 6.D the unredacted version of 
Plaintiffs’ letter response to Defendant VTB Bank PJSC’s (‘VTB”) letter motion for a pre-motion

ANDREW L. CARTER, JR., United States District Judge:                      
    Defendant Sberbank of Russia submitted a motion for reconsideration (ECF No. 220) and 
a pre-motion letter for certification of interlocutory appeal (ECF No. 222) of the Court’s Sept. 30, 
2021, Memorandum and Opinion (The “Sept. 2021 Decision” at ECF 185). Those motions are 
DENIED.                                                                   

                         BACKGROUND                                      
    I assume the parties’ familiarity with the facts, which are set forth more fully in the 
Memorandum and Order denying Defendants’ previous motion to dismiss. ECF No. 185. In short, 
according  to  the  original  complaint  and  Second  Amended  Complaint  (“SAC”),  Defendants 
Sberbank and VTB Bank provided material support and financing to the Donetsk People’s 
Republic, a terrorist group accused of downing a Malaysia Airlines flight over Eastern Ukraine in 
2014.                                                                     
                          DISCUSSION                                     
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION                                                
    Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a party can seek relief from a final judgment 
for any of the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) 
newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time 
to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or 
extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) 
the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has 

been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason 
that justifies relief. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).                         
    The Second Circuit has held that Rule 60(b) is “a mechanism for ‘extraordinary judicial 
relief’ invoked only if the moving party demonstrates ‘exceptional circumstances.’” Ren Yuan 
Deng v. New York State Off. of Mental Health, 783 F.App’x. 72, 73 (2d Cir. 2019). Rule 60(b) 
motions “should be broadly construed to do ‘substantial justice,’ yet final judgments should not 
‘be lightly reopened.’” Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 1986) (internal citation 
omitted). A motion for reconsideration “should not be granted where the moving party seeks solely 
to relitigate an issue already decided.” Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 
1995.)                                                                    

    Here, Sberbank has asked that the Court reconsider the Sept. 30, 2021 Decision, but has 
not shown sufficient material facts or law that would warrant overturning our prior ruling. The 
Court carefully considered the parties arguments on personal jurisdiction, potential liability under 
the ATA, and other relevant legal concepts. The Court weighed those arguments against the facts 
alleged in the operative complaint and found that it “contain[ed] sufficient factual matter, accepted 
as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 
(2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). As this Court has held 
before,  “[R]econsideration  of  a  previous  order  is  an  extraordinary  remedy  to  be  employed 
sparingly in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.” Canfield v. 
SS&C Techs. Holdings, Inc., 2021 WL 1026128, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2021). 
    Therefore, Sberbank’s motion for reconsideration is denied.          


INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL                                                      
    Having denied the motion for reconsideration, we will now turn to whether to certify an 
order for interlocutory review of the Sept. 30, 2021 Decision by the Second Circuit. Sberbank’s 
letter requests an interlocutory appeal of “(1) the causation standard applied by the Opinion [. . .]; 
(2) the Opinion’s finding of adequate pleading of knowledge and intent to engage in “international 
terrorism” [. . .]; and (3) the assertion of personal jurisdiction based on the SAC’s allegations [. . 
.].”                                                                      
    A district court has authority to certify an order for interlocutory appeal when “such order 
involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of 
opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate 

termination of the litigation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Given the general policy of deferring appellate 
review until after the entry of a final judgment, interlocutory review is granted only in “exceptional 
circumstances.” In re Flor, 79 F.3d 281, 284 (2d Cir. 1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted). 
Movants cannot invoke the appellate process as a vehicle to provide early review of difficult 
rulings in hard cases. Only ‘exceptional circumstances’ will justify a departure from the basic 
policy of avoiding appellate review until a final decision on the merits. In re Ambac Fin. Group, 
Inc. Sec. Litig., 693 F.Supp.2d 241, 282 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (internal quotations and citations 
omitted).                                                                 
      As we noted above in relation to Sberbank’s motion for reconsideration, the Court carefully 
weighed the parties’  arguments for causation, potential liability under the ATA, and personal 
jurisdiction. Once again, we find that Sberbank has not shown the ‘exceptional circumstances’ to 
change the Court’s prior ruling, or to move to the appellate process without further proceedings at 
the district court. Here, the mixed questions of law and fact concerning Sberbank’s conduct, its 
connection with New York’s financial system, and the subject of its knowledge and intent are not 
suitable for appellate review without a full record. See In re Worldcom, Inc., No. M—47 HB, 2003 
WL 21498904, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2003) (§1292(b) appeal requires “a ‘pure’ question of 
law that the reviewing  court  ‘could  decide  quickly  and  cleanly without having to  study the 
record’”) Jd. at 285. 

                                   CONCLUSION 
      For the reasons set forth above,  Sberbank’s motion for reconsideration and motion for 
interlocutory appeal are DENIED. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate ECF 
No. 220. 

SO ORDERED.

THOMAS SCHANSMAN, et al. 
                  Plaintiffs, 
            -against- 
 SBERBANK OF RUSSIA PJSC, et al.               No. 1:19-cv-02985-ALC-GWG 
                  Defendants. 

PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING SBERBANK OF RUSSIA’S 
        COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURT’S MARCH 9, 2022 ORDER AND 
         ADJUSTING THE JURISDICTIONAL DISCOVERY SCHEDULE 
               PENDING SBERBANK OF RUSSIA’S COMPLIANCE 
      Sberbank  of Russia has  failed to  comply with Court-ordered jurisdictional  discovery, 
producing no non-public communications, no communications from its officers, and undertaking 
no efforts to search for such communications, notwithstanding the Court’s March 9, 2022 Order 
requiring it to do so.  ECF No. 298.  Plaintiffs thus request an order requiring Sberbank of Russia 
to  comply with the  Court’s  March  9,  2022  Order and  adjusting the remaining  schedule  for 
Jurisdictional  discovery pending  Sberbank  of Russia’s  compliance.  Because the  outstanding 
documents are relevant to the deposition of Sberbank of Russia’s expert witness, Plaintiffs request 
relief in advance of Court-ordered expert depositions the week of April 4, 2022. 
   1.     Background 
      On February  18, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a proposed plan for jurisdictional discovery that 
sought documents concerning three issues, including “[t]he degree of independence the Central 
Bank of the Russian Federation . .  . enjoys vis-a-vis the Russian Federation and the Federation’s 
agencies of state power.” ECF No. 29] at 1 (designated as “Issue ’”’). Plaintiffs sought two specific 
categories of documents relevant to the instant submission: 
   A.  “Communications and statements from Sberbank officers about (1) the Central Bank’s 
      independence  from  the  Russian  Federation,  or  (2)  the  governmental  or  commercial 
      functions  of the  Central Bank,  including  in the  context of the April 2020 transfer of 
      Sberbank shares from the Central Bank to the Ministry of Finance.”; and 
   C.  “Documents sufficient to  show the independence (or lack thereof)  of the members  of 
      Sberbank’s Supervisory Board from 2019 to present who are officers or personnel of the 
      Central Bank or the Russian Federation, including the  ‘agreement on representation of 
      interests of the Government of the Russian Federation’ referred to in Federal Law No. 50- 
      FZ of March 18, 2020, which governs the Ministry of Finance’s acquisition of Sberbank 
      shares from the Central Bank.” 
Id. at 1-2 (Plaintiffs’ proposed jurisdictional discovery plan).

 Sberbank of Russia opposed Plaintiffs’ request for these documents.  ECF No. 292 (Feb. 23, 
2022 opposition to Plaintiffs’ proposed jurisdictional discovery plan).  With respect to Request 
I.A, Sberbank of Russia objected because it would require the production of “Sberbank’s internal 
and external ‘communications and statements,’” including “the production of communications of 
senior Russian executives and officials.”  Id. at 9.1  Sberbank of Russia also explicitly argued that 
such discovery should not be required because “Russian law and publicly available documents 
address these topics directly and authoritatively.”  Id.  With respect to Request I.C, Sberbank of 
Russia offered voluminous objections on relevance grounds but did not object on the basis that the 
agreement was unobtainable through Sberbank of Russia.  ECF No. 292 at 10-11. 
 Notwithstanding Sberbank of Russia’s arguments, the Court ordered Sberbank of Russia to 
produce documents responsive to Issue I.  ECF No. 298 (Mar. 9, 2022 Scheduling Order).  The 
Court denied Plaintiffs’ request for discovery as to Issues II and III, observing that jurisdictional 
discovery should be “limited to the specific facts relevant to making an immunity determination 
under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.”  Id.                         
 On March 16, 2022, Sberbank of Russia produced documents to Plaintiffs, but the production 
did not comply with the Court’s order.  Its production was limited to publicly available documents. 
With respect to Request I.A, Sberbank of Russia did not produce any “Communications . . . from 
Sberbank officers”; it made no effort to search for documents maintained by any of its officers; it 
did not search for internal or other non-public communications, such as emails; and it did not 
produce any documents that would shed light on communications from Sberbank of Russia officers 
about the key issue of the Central Bank’s independence.  See Exhibit A (correspondence with 
counsel for Sberbank of Russia about its document production).  With respect to Request I.C, 
Sberbank of Russia did not produce the required agreement and asserted for the first time that 
Plaintiffs should instead request the agreement from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian 
Federation (a non-party government agency), even though certain Sberbank officers are party to 
the agreement that the Court ordered Sberbank of Russia to produce.  Id. at 1.   
 II.  Argument                                                           
    Sberbank of Russia failed to comply with the Court’s March 9, 2022 Order.  Simply put, 
Sberbank of Russia made no efforts to search for or produce documents it was required to produce.  
Sberbank of Russia’s objections to Plaintiffs’ document requests make clear that it understood the 
scope of Plaintiffs’ requests, ECF No. 292 at 9-11, but it did not search for or produce documents 
in conformance with its understanding and the Court’s subsequent Order, ECF No. 298. 
    Any attempt by Sberbank of Russia to relitigate the scope of the Court’s narrowly tailored 
jurisdictional  discovery  order  should  be  rejected.    Plaintiffs  sought  communications  from 
Sberbank of Russia officers  after discovering public statements by officials  of the Russian 
Federation, the Central Bank of Russia, and Sberbank’s Chief Executive Officer that appeared to 
contradict  Sberbank  of  Russia’s  representations  to  this  Court  about  the  Central  Bank’s 
independence, a key aspect of Sberbank’s immunity claim.  ECF No. 270 at 7-8; ECF No. 283 at 
7-8.    Sberbank  of  Russia  disagreed  with  Plaintiffs’  characterization  of  these  statements, 
minimizing the probative value of the statement by its own Chief Executive Officer because it was 

1 Sberbank of Russia’s understanding in its opposition brief was consistent with the applicable 
uniform discovery rule, which defines a “communication” as any “transmittal of information (in 
the form of facts, ideas, inquiries or otherwise).”  S.D.N.Y. Civ. R. 26.3(c)(1). 
merely a “symbolic statement in a Sberbank press release” with “no legal or formal content.”  ECF 
No. 289 at 9-10 (Feb. 14, 2022 Sberbank of Russia reply brief).  These developments demonstrate 
a disputed issue of fact concerning the status of the Central Bank of Russia, and thus “specific 
facts relevant to making an immunity determination under the [FSIA].”  ECF No. 298.  In 
analogous circumstances, the Second Circuit has approved jurisdictional discovery for purposes 
of determining a defendant’s entitlement to immunity under the FSIA, including because the 
plaintiffs  “provided  adequate  contrary  evidence”  in  the  form  of  “admissions  attributed  to 
defendants’ own agents.”  Funk v. Belneftekhim, 861 F.3d 354, 367 (2d Cir. 2017) (evidence of 
contrary statements from defendants’ executives warranted further jurisdictional discovery).2 
    Because  of  the  imminent  requirement  for  Plaintiffs  to  complete  their  deposition  of 
Sberbank of Russia’s expert witness and promptly thereafter submit their opposition brief to 
Sberbank’s second motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs unfortunately must ask the Court to adjust the 
jurisdictional discovery schedule to account for Sberbank of Russia’s noncompliance.  The 
appropriate remedy is an order requiring Sberbank of Russia to comply with the Court’s March 9, 
2022 Order, ECF No. 298, and to adjust the remaining schedule for jurisdictional discovery and 
briefing on Sberbank’s second motion to dismiss pending Sberbank of Russia’s compliance with 
its jurisdictional discovery obligations.3  Plaintiffs request an order specifying that, upon Sberbank 
of Russia’s compliance, the period for expert depositions is to begin eight days, and conclude 
twenty-two (22) days, after Sberbank of Russia completes its document production (a period of 
time equivalent to the time allowed in the existing schedule).  This adjustment will ensure that 
Plaintiffs need only depose Sberbank of Russia’s expert once, with the benefit of the documents 
the Court has already ordered Sberbank of Russia to produce.              
 III.  Conclusion                                                        
    For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs request an order compelling Sberbank of Russia to 
comply with the Court’s March 9, 2022 order, ECF No. 298, with respect to Requests I.A and I.C, 
and to adjust the jurisdictional discovery schedule pending Sberbank of Russia’s compliance. 


2 Written communications of a defendant’s officers are an appropriate subject of jurisdictional 
discovery for an immunity determination under the FSIA.  See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Islamic 
Republic of Iran, 138 F.R.D. 1, 4, 5 (D.D.C. 1991) (approving jurisdictional discovery into 
“written communications” of the defendant’s officials for purposes of FSIA determination); Kelly 
v. Syria Shell Petrol. Dev. B.V., 213 F.3d 841, 855 (5th Cir. 2000) (noting that magistrate judge 
authorized jurisdictional discovery into defendant’s communications for purposes of FSIA and 
personal jurisdiction); cf. Intelsat Glob. Sales & Mktg., Ltd. v. Cmty. of Yugoslav Posts Telegraphs 
& Telephones, 534 F. Supp. 2d 32, 33 (D.D.C. 2008) (ordering FSIA jurisdictional discovery 
where  communications  of  defendant’s  senior  officer  “provide[d]  circumstantial  evidence  of 
[defendant’s] governmental status at the time of the filing of the complaint”). 
3 The Court may order penalties for Sberbank of Russia’s noncompliance far more significant than 
Plaintiffs request here.  For example, the Second Circuit approved monetary penalties and an 
evidentiary presumption in plaintiff’s favor after a defendant asserting immunity under the FSIA 
failed to produce jurisdictional discovery necessary to resolve the defendant’s purported status as 
an agency or instrumentality.  Funk v. Belneftekhim, 739 F. App’x 674, 679 (2d Cir. 2018); see 
also Funk v. Belneftekhim, 861 F.3d 354, 368, 371 (2d Cir. 2017).

  discovery dispute(s) and file a joint status report, not to exceed three 
  pages, indicating whether they have resolved the dispute(s) privately and, 
  if needed, highlighting any remaining issues in dispute after they meet 
  and confer, no later than April 11, 2022. The Court will extend the 
  Jurisdictional discovery schedule by seven (7) days to allow the parties to 
  attempt to resolve this dispute without further assistance from the Court.

to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint. (ECF Nos.  160, 165, 168.) For the following 
reasons, Defendants’ motions to dismiss are denied.

                         BACKGROUND                                      
    According to the second amended complaint, which the Court assumes to be true for 
purposes of Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motions, this action arises from the downing of a Malaysia 
Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) on July 17, 2014 by a terrorist group known as the Donetsk People’s 
Republic (“DPR”).1 298 passengers were killed when the DPR fired a missile at the civilian 
passenger plane traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, including Quinn Lucas Schansman, 
whose family, the Plaintiffs in this action, bring this lawsuit on his behalf. Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 
1-2, 73-75. The Defendants in this action are Russian State-owned Banks, Sberbank and VTB 
Bank. Additionally, The Western Union Company and MoneyGram International, Inc. are United 
States based company Defendants. Id. at ¶¶ 33, 40, 63-64.                 

    The DPR is a terrorist group based on an ideology of Russian supremacy by creating a 
proto-state, Novorossiya, through the control of territory in Ukraine. Second Am. Compl. ¶ 88. 
Additionally, the DPR have carried out violent acts intended to affect government policy and 
intimidate civilians around the world. Id. at ¶¶ 98, 102.                 
     The basic tenet of Plaintiffs’ claims is that Defendants provided material support and 
financing to the DPR. Second Am. Compl. ¶ 79. In providing this material support, Plaintiffs allege 
that Defendants were aware of the DPR’s terrorist activities, as the DPR has openly, publicly, and 
repeatedly carried out terrorist attacks on civilians, and these attacks were widely reported and 
discussed by nearly every government across the world, media, and human rights organizations. 

Second Am. Compl. ¶ 104. Plaintiffs’ cite articles from the New York Times, the Washington 
Post, The Independent, The Telegraph, and the Al-Jazeera America detailing the DPR, including 
attacks, their tactics, and profiling the DPR’s leadership. Id. at ¶¶ 104-106, 108, 110, 112.  


1 The DPR’s leader, Igor Ivanovich Stelkov, took credit for the attack on the plane. Am. Compl. ¶ 77.  
    In the months leading to the attack on MH17, Defendants had extensive operations in 
Ukraine, maintaining locations and providing global money transfer services. Second Am. Compl. 
¶¶ 139-143. The DPR used Defendants’ services to raise money and advertised ways to donate 
money to accounts or bank cards associated with Defendants Sberbank and VTB Bank. Id. at ¶¶ 

143-150. Additionally, the DPR detailed ways to donate using the money transfer services of 
MoneyGram and Western Union. Id. The DPR utilized a small group of fundraisers, and the DPR 
detailed how the receipt of funds were confirmed by their leader, Igor Strelkov. Id. at ¶¶ 154-155. 
As to the use of the funds, the DPR relied on Defendants’ services to access funds that were 
essential for its procurement of weapons and ammunition and to acquire control of the territory 
from which the DPR launched the missile that brought down MH17. Id. at ¶ 159.  
    Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants were aware that they were providing material 
support and financing to the DPR. Plaintiffs cite news outlets, Forbes, the New York Times, 
Reuters and the Kyiv Post as reporting the DPR’s funding scheme. Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 162-
167. For instance, Forbes discussed Defendant Sberbank facilitating payments to Ukrainian 

soldiers to assist Russian Separatists in East Ukraine; a Reuters article titled “Ukraine says 
investigating Russia’s Sberbank for financing terrorists;” and an April article by Kyiv post detailed 
the DPR’s call for funds as well as references to Sberbank and VTB Bank’s knowledge of the 
investigation initiated by Ukrainian authorities prior to the downing of MH17. Id.at ¶¶ 167-169.  
    DPR fundraisers advertised and provided an explanation on how to wire U.S. dollars from 
abroad into Russian bank accounts like Sberbank and VTB Bank. Second Am. Compl. ¶ 177. 
These fundraisers also listed account holder and email address information for money transfers 
through Western Union and MoneyGram. Id. at ¶ 178. As to the funds received, the DPR published 
online detailed ledgers reflecting the funds that the DPR received using Defendants’ services, and 
the DPR also detailed how the funds were used to purchase equipment and weaponry “necessary 
for the DPR’s terrorist activities.” Id. at ¶¶ 179-180.                   
    Plaintiffs detail several fundraisers, including Save Donbass, the Center for New Russia, 
Veche, Rospisatel, World Crisis, Icorpus, Sevastopol, Essence of Time, and People’s Militia of 

New Russia, that were used to solicit funds to provide lethal support directly to the DPR, 
specifically Igor Strelkov and Paul Gubarev (the self-declared people’s governor of the DPR). 
Additionally, the fundraisers provided reports of transfers and withdrawals from its accounts with 
Defendants Sberbank and VTB Bank and money transferred through Defendant Western Union. 
Additionally, many of the fundraisers advertised that transfers could be made through Defendants 
Western Union and Moneygram. Second Am. Compl.  ¶¶ 105, 194-209, 210-292.  
    Additionally, Plaintiffs detail Defendants’ support through Alexander Zhuchkovsky, who 
publicly boasted about raising millions of rubles for the DPR and then provided lethal weapons to 
Igor Strelkov. Second Am. Compl.  ¶¶ 293, 296-305. Additionally, Zhuchkovsky indicated that 
transfers could be made to a specific Sberbank bank card or via Western Union, and Zhuchkovsky 

solicited funds through transfers utilizing VTB Bank, Sberbank, Moneygram, and Western Union. 
Id. at ¶¶ 317, 318. Zhuchkovsky’s website indicates that he has raised approximately 89 Rubles, 
or $2.5 million U.S. dollars for the DPR during the first six months of 2014, prior to the attach on 
MH17. Id. at ¶¶ 321-326.                                                  
    Through  the  material  support  and  financing  to  the  DPR  using  Defendants’  services 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have knowingly provided this material support and financing to 
the  DPR,  and  Defendants’  knowledge  or  deliberate  indifference  in  providing  this  support 
constituted acts of international terrorism. Id. at ¶¶ 342-391.           
                        PROCEDURAL HISTORY                               
    Plaintiffs commenced this action on April 4, 2019. (ECF No. 1.) Plaintiffs filed a First 
Amended Complaint on October 8, 2019, and a Second Amended Complaint on October 5, 2020. 
(ECF Nos. 104, 156.) Defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on November 
2, 2020. (ECF Nos. 160, 165, 168.) Plaintiffs opposed the motion on November 30, 2020, and 

Defendants replied on December 14, 2020. (ECF Nos. 172, 173, 174, 175, 176.) The Court 
considers the motions fully briefed.                                      
                             DISCUSSION                                  
    I.   Standard of Review                                              
    When deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, courts may rely on 
pleadings and affidavits, in which case “the plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing that 
the court possesses personal jurisdiction over the defendant.” DiStefano v. Carozzi North America, 
Inc., 286 F.3d 81, 84 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). When deciding whether 
Plaintiffs have made such a showing, the Court must “construe the pleadings and affidavits in the 
light most favorable to [Plaintiffs], resolving all doubts in [their] favor.” Id. 

    “This prima facie showing must include an averment of facts that, if credited by the 
ultimate trier of fact, would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.” Licci ex rel. Licci 
v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 673 F.3d 50, 59 (2d Cir. 2012) (“Licci I”) (internal quotation 
marks and alterations omitted). When parties do not submit “an affidavit or other evidence on 
which the court could rely . . . the court must rely on the allegations in the complaint to determine 
if personal jurisdiction exists.” MacFarlane v. Brock, No. 3:00 CV 97, 2000 WL 1827353, at *2 
(D. Conn. Nov. 30, 2000). Here, the parties have not submitted affidavits on the issue of personal 
jurisdiction, but they have submitted declarations and exhibits.          
    To survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain 
sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 
570 (2007)).  A claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows 

the Court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  
Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  The plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show “more 
than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully,” and accordingly, where the plaintiff 
alleges facts that are “‘merely consistent with’ a defendant’s liability, it ‘stops short of the line 
between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’”  Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
557).                                                                     
    In considering a motion to dismiss, the court accepts as true all factual allegations in the 
complaint and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  See Goldstein v. Pataki, 516 
F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 2008).  However, the court need not credit “[t]hreadbare recitals of the 
elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 

(citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555); see also id. at 681.  Instead, the complaint must provide factual 
allegations sufficient “to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon 
which it rests.”  Port Dock & Stone Corp. v. Oldcastle Northeast, Inc., 507 F.3d 117, 121 (2d Cir. 
2007) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  In addition to the factual allegations in the complaint, 
the court also may consider “the documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and any 
documents incorporated in the complaint by reference.”  Peter F. Gaito Architecture, LLC v. 
Simone Dev. Corp., 602 F.3d 57, 64 (2d Cir. 2010) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
    i.   Personal Jurisdiction                                           
    VTB Bank and Sberbank argue that the Second Amended Complaint fails to establish 
personal jurisdiction as the conduct took place in Ukraine, and Plaintiffs have failed to establish 
that the two banks transacted business within New York. See VTB Bank’s Mem. of Law at 18; 

Sberbank’s Mem. of Law at 7-15. The Court disagrees.                      
    In determining personal jurisdiction, the Court must first “look to the law of the forum state 
to determine whether personal jurisdiction will lie” and, if “jurisdiction lies, [courts] consider 
whether the district court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant comports 
with due process protections established under the United States Constitution.” Licci ex rel. Licci 
v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161, 168 (2d Cir. 2013) (Licci II). New York’s long-
arm statute provides that a court “may exercise personal jurisdiction over any non-domiciliary . . . 
who in person or through an agent . . . transacts any business within the state or contracts anywhere 
to supply goods or services in the state.” N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a)(1).       
    A single transaction may be sufficient to satisfy this requirement, provided the relevant 

claims arise from that transaction. Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez, 171 
F.3d 779, 787 (2d Cir. 1999). To exercise specific jurisdiction over a defendant consistent with the 
defendant’s due process rights, “the defendant’s suit-related conduct must create a substantial 
connection with the forum State.” Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Organization, 835 F.3d 317, 
335 (2d Cir. 2016). However, “[t]here is no requirement under [New York’s long-arm statute] that 
a plaintiff’s claim must arise exclusively from New York conduct.” Strauss v. Crédit Lyonnais, 
S.A., 175 F.Supp.3d 3, 25 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (Strauss II).                   
    The Second Circuit has held that “the selection and repeated use of New York’s banking 
system, as an instrument for accomplishing the alleged wrongs” under the ATA is sufficient for a 
bank to be subject to the specific jurisdiction of a district court in New York. Licci II, 732 F.3d at 
171. In Licci II, specific jurisdiction was proper when a bank “deliberately chose to process . . . 
wire transfers . . . in New York” when “[i]n light of the widespread acceptance and availability of 
U.S. currency, [the bank] could have . . . processed U.S.-dollar-denominated wire transfers . . . 

through correspondent accounts anywhere in the world.” Id.                
    Further, to establish personal jurisdiction, ATA claims “do not necessarily [have to] 
correspond one-to-one with particular transfers, but instead [may] rest upon the millions of dollars 
[d]efendant allegedly transferred to [terrorist] front organizations in close temporal proximity to 
the . . . attacks in which Plaintiffs were injured.” Strauss II, 175 F.Supp.3d at 24; see also Weiss v. 
National Westminster Bank PLC, 176 F. Supp. 3d 264, 280 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (finding personal 
jurisdiction over a bank proper when transfers routed through a bank “overlapped with the attacks 
. . . that caused Plaintiffs’ injuries, but also occurred at a time when Defendant allegedly knew that 
funds it transferred . . . were being used to support a terrorist organization”). 
    When transfers made through New York are “part of that allegedly unlawful conduct, the 

Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to claims made in connection with all [relevant] 
attacks.” Strauss II at 24. “A foreign bank’s repeated use of a correspondent account in New York 
on behalf of a client – in effect, a course of dealing – shows purposeful availment of New York’s 
dependable and transparent banking system, the dollar as a stable and fungible currency, and the 
predictable jurisdictional and commercial law of New York and the United States.” Id. at 19 
(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).                       
    Here, the Court relies on the allegations in the complaint to determine whether it has 
personal jurisdiction over the Defendant banks. The allegations in the Second Amended Complaint 
are sufficient for Plaintiffs to make a prima facie case that the Court has personal jurisdiction over 
VTB Bank and Sberbank as the banks chose to operate correspondent accounts in New York and 
are alleged to have made transfers using New York’s banking system when the Defendant banks 
could have processed transfers anywhere in the world. According to the Second Amended 
Complaint, VTB Bank and Sberbank routed U.S. Dollar dominated transactions to or on behalf of 

the DPR. Second Am. Complaint ¶¶ 27, 56, 177-332. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that prior to 
the attack on MH17, the DPR provided instructions on how to send transfers in U.S. Dollars to 
Sberbank and VTB Bank’s correspondent accounts in New York. Id. at ¶ 58. Likewise, fundraisers 
for the DPR advertised VTB Bank’s and Sberbank’s correspondent accounts in New York, as well 
their account numbers, to process U.S. Dollar transactions, and the New York Times reported that 
U.S. Dollars had passed from an unnamed international bank to the Veche fundraiser. Id. at ¶¶ 
173, 178, 216, 220. The DPR’s Sevastopol fundraiser explained that the only way to transfer U.S. 
Dollars was to use Sberbank’s correspondent account in New York. Id.at ¶ 283. 
    Taking this conduct into consideration, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have made a prima 
facie showing that jurisdiction exists and that Defendants VTB Bank and Sberbank provided 

financial services to the DPR using New York’s banking system. Defendants’ arguments that 
Plaintiffs  have  not  provided  factual  support  that  they  knew  they  were  supporting  terrorist 
organizations and that the organizations that were provided funds are not listed as Foreign Terrorist 
Organizations are unavailing in light Plaintiffs’ allegations that VTB Bank and Sberbank were 
aware of Ukrainian investigations as early as April 2014, three months before the attack, into their 
support of Ukrainian separatists associated with the DPR. See Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 163-170. 
Additionally, Defendants’ support of the DPR through fundraisers or other intermediaries does not 
foreclose a finding of personal jurisdiction over Defendants as Plaintiffs allege facts to support 
that Defendants knew they were supporting the DPR when they completed transfers for fundraisers 
supporting the DPR. See generally Strauss II at 29-31. Moreover, Defendants’ argument that the 
two identified transfers amounting to $300 are insufficient is equally unavailing in light of the 
second amended complaint. Plaintiffs have alleged that the DPR has raised millions of dollars 
through fundraising, some of which were transferred using VTB Bank and Sberbank’s services. 

See SAC ¶ 171, 298. Construing this in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the inference is that 
some of those funds raised were transferred using VTB Bank and Sberbank’s services. Plaintiffs 
need not allege “dozens of transfers over an extended period . . . to establish a course of dealing 
and purposeful use of the New York correspondent accounts.” Averbach v. Cairo Amman Bank, 
No. 19 CV 0004, 2020 WL 486860, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2020), report and recommendation 
adopted sub nom. Averbach for Est. of Averbach v. Cairo Amman Bank, No. 19-CV 00004, 2020 
WL 1130733 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2020).  At this juncture of the case, Plaintiffs are not required to 
make the showing that Defendants suggest. Plaintiffs need only plead facts that, if credited, would 
establish jurisdiction over Defendants. Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 
567 (2d Cir. 1996).                                                       

    The Court may therefore exercise personal jurisdiction over VTB Bank and Sberbank for 
Plaintiffs’ claims.                                                       
    ii.  Liability under 18 U.S.C. § 2333(a)                             

 a.  International Terrorism                                             
    Section 2333(a) of the ATA provides that “[a]ny national of the United States injured in 
his or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism, or his or her 
estate,  survivors,  or  heirs,  may  sue”  for  damages.  Section  2331(1)  of  the  ATA  defines 
“international terrorism” as activities that:                             
    (A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the 
    criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal 
    violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; 
    (B) appear to be intended—                                           
    (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;                   
    (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or 
    (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or 
    kidnapping; and                                                      
    (C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or 
    transcend  national  boundaries  in  terms  of  the  means  by  which  they  are 
    accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the 
    locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum;           

    The Second Circuit has “conclude[d] . . . that providing routine financial services 
to members and associates of terrorist organizations is not so akin to providing a loaded 
gun to a child as to . . . compel a finding that as a matter of law, the services” met the 
definition of “international terrorism” under the ATA. Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 882 F.3d 
314, 327 (2d Cir. 2018) (“Linde II”). Whether financial services are “routine  . . . raises 
questions of fact for a jury to decide.” Id.                              
    Judge Posner of the Seventh Circuit explained that when Defendants provide 
financial support to an organization like Hamas who “knew the aims and activities of the 
organization”  would  “by  augmenting  Hamas’s  resources  .  .  .  enable  Hamas  to  kill 
or wound, or try to kill, or conspire to kill more people in Israel.” Boim v. Holy Land 
Foundation for Relief and Development, 549 F.3d 685, 694 (7th Cir. 2008) (Boim III). 
”And given such foreseeable consequences, such donations would appear to be intended to 
intimidate or coerce a civilian population or to affect the conduct of a government by 
assassination, as required by section 2331(1)” of the ATA. Id. (internal quotation marks 
and alterations omitted). Even if one does not know the organization engages in terrorism, 
liability is appropriate when one “is deliberately indifferent to whether it does or not, 
meaning that one knows there is a substantial probability that the organization engages in 
terrorism but one does not care.” Id. at 693.                             
    Thus, “[g]iving money to Hamas, like giving a loaded gun to a child (which also is 
not a violent act), is an ‘act dangerous to human life’” under the ATA. Id. at 690. Courts 
have opined that providing financial services, like the money transfers alleged in the 
present case “increases Hamas' ability to carry out attacks in the same way, and Congress 

made no distinction between these different forms of material support in criminalizing 
them.” Linde v. Arab Bank, PLC, 97 F.Supp.3d 287, 323 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (vacated on other 
grounds) (“Linde I”).                                                     
    Defendants allege that their actions were not acts of international terrorism and the 
ATA’s act of war exclusion bars Plaintiffs’ claims. Additionally, Defendants allege that 
Plaintiffs have failed to meet the ATA’s proximate causation requirement. Defendant 
Sberbank further alleges that Plaintiffs fail to plead facts showing the requisite knowledge 
or intent to commit predicate crimes of providing support for a terrorist act. See generally 
Defs’ Mem. of Law, ECF Nos. 161, 162, 166, 171, 173, 174, 175, 176.       
    Plaintiffs  have  adequately  pleaded  that  Defendants’  actions  were  acts  of 

international terrorism. The Court considers whether Defendants’ providing of financial 
support to fundraisers and individuals who in turn provided money to the DPR that assisted 
in the attack on MH17 is a “violent act[ ] or act[ ] dangerous to human life” within the 
meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 2331(1). As the Court noted supra, while the Second Circuit opined 
that  providing  routine  financial  support  to  terrorist  organizations  is  not  “so  akin  to 
providing a loaded gun to a child,” it did not preclude this Court from finding that such 
conduct is an act of “international terrorism.” Linde, 882 F.3d at 327 (“We need not here 
decide whether we would . . . conclude that a jury could find that direct monetary donations 
to a known terrorist organization satisfy § 2331(1)’s definitional requirements for an act of 
terrorism.”).                                                             
    Courts have made such a finding before, reasoning that when banks such as 
Sberbank and VTB Bank route payments and maintain accounts for terrorist organizations 

to enhance their ability to commit terrorist attacks, they are committing “acts dangerous to 
human life.” Miller v. Arab Bank, PLC, 372 F. Supp. 3d 33, 45 (E.D.N.Y. 2019). The Court 
applies the same reasoning here. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Sberbank, VTB Bank, 
Moneygram, and Western Union provided financial services to fundraisers and individuals 
who supported the DPR, and these fundraisers and individuals then provided the funds to 
the DPR before and after the attack on MH17. Plaintiffs further allege that the fundraiser 
funds were confirmed by Igor Strelkov, the leader of the DPR, and additional funds were 
raised by Alexander Zhuchkovsky, who publicly boasted about raising millions for the 
DPR. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the funds raised were used to purchase lethal 
weapons prior to the attack on MH17. Thus, based on the well pleaded allegations in the 

Second Amended Complaint, Defendants committed an act of “international terrorism” 
within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 2331(1).                                
 b.  Intent                                                              
    Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded the requisite intent or knowledge required for 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2339A and § 2339C. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants were deliberately indifferent to whether 
they were providing material support to the DPR or to whether they were providing financial 
services to the DPR that were used to carry out certain enumerated acts outlined in Sections 2339A 
and 2339C.                                                                
    Under § 2339A, liability attaches when the provider of material support or resources knew 
or intended that its financial services would be used in preparation for or carrying out violations 
of  the  various  criminal-law  provisions  referenced  in  subsection  (a). 18  U.S.C.  §  2339A(a). 
However, the provider need not have had the “specific intent to aid or encourage the particular 

attacks that injured plaintiffs.” Linde, 384 F.Supp.2d at 586 n. 9.       
    Under  §  2339C,  liability  attaches  when    Defendants  provide  or  collect  funds  with 
knowledge that such funds are to be used, in full or part, to carry out . . . any . . . act intended to 
cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian . . . when the purpose of such act, by its nature or 
context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization 
to do or to abstain from doing any act. § 2339C(a)(1). The provision includes “giving, donating, 
and transmitting” funds and collection includes “raising and receiving” funds. 18 U.S.C. § 
2339C(e)(4). Thus, providing financial services to a terrorist organization falls within the scope of 
§ 2339C, to the extent that the financial institution receives and transmits the organization's 
funds. See, e.g., Weiss, 453 F.Supp.2d at 628–30 (concluding, after reviewing legislative history, 

that “maintenance of bank accounts[ ] and processing of deposits and withdrawals” constitutes 
provision and collection under § 2339C); Linde, 384 F.Supp.2d at 588 (denying motion to dismiss 
claims against bank for provision of financial services under § 2339C where bank received funds 
as deposits and transmitted funds to terrorist organizations).            
    Regarding state of mind, like § 2339A, § 2339C does not require a showing of specific 
intent that the defendant acted to further the organization’s terrorist activities or that it intended to 
aid or encourage the particular attack giving rise to a plaintiff’s injuries. Boim v. Quranic Literacy 
Inst. & Holy Land Found. For Relief And Dev., 291 F.3d 1000, 1023 (7th Cir. 2002) (Boim I). 
Rather, mere knowledge that the funds provided and collected would be used to carry out the 
predicate act is enough. See, e.g., Linde, 384 F.Supp.2d at 588 (denying motion to dismiss where 
the  plaintiffs  alleged  that  a  financial  institution  knew  that  funds  received  as  deposits  and 
transmitted  to  various  organizations  “were  to  be  used  for  conducting  acts  of  international 
terrorism.”).                                                             

    Plaintiffs allege that Defendants were deliberately indifferent as to whether they were 
providing funds to the DPR due to the DPR’s public crowdsourcing campaign, international 
recognition of their activities, funding of the DPR’s leaders who identified their relation to the 
DPR, the DPR’s publicizing of its terrorist activities across several websites, and the investigation 
by Ukrainian authorities into VTB Bank and Sberbank.                      
    These allegations are sufficient to satisfy the intent requirement. The Court notes that 
Plaintiffs need not show that Defendants knew their providing of financial services would further 
terrorism or the attack on MH17. Rather, it is sufficient to show that it deliberately disregarded 
such facts while continuing to provide financial services to the DPR with knowledge that the 
services would in all likelihood assist the organization in accomplishing its goals. Goldberg v. UBS 

AG, 660 F. Supp. 2d 410, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2009); see also Boim II, 549 F.3d at 685 (quoting Makor 
Issues & Rights, Ltd. v. Tellabs Inc., 513 F.3d 702, 704 (7th Cir.2008)) (“To give money to an 
organization that commits terrorist acts is not intentional misconduct unless one either knows that 
the organization engages in such acts or is deliberately indifferent to whether it does or not, 
meaning that one knows there is a substantial probability that the organization engages in terrorism 
but one does not care. ‘When the facts known to a person place him on notice of a risk, he cannot 
ignore the facts and plead ignorance of the risk.’”                       
    Here, Defendants were on notice of the DPR’s activities. Plaintiffs cite news outlets, 
Forbes, the New York Times, Reuters and the Kyiv Post as reporting the DPR’s funding scheme. 
Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 162-167. For instance, Forbes discussed Defendant Sberbank facilitating 
payments to Ukrainian soldiers to assist Russian Separatists in East Ukraine; a Reuters article titled 
“Ukraine says investigating Russia’s Sberbank for financing terrorists;” and an April article by 
Kyiv post detailed the DPR’s call for funds as well as references to Sberbank and VTB Bank’s 

knowledge of the investigation initiated by Ukrainian authorities prior to the downing of the plane. 
Id.at ¶¶ 167-169. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the DPR has openly, publicly, and repeatedly 
carried out terrorist attacks on civilians, and these attacks were widely reported and discussed by 
nearly every government across the world, media, and human rights organizations. Second Am. 
Compl. ¶ 104.                                                             
    Plaintiffs’ allegations are sufficient to show that Defendants were deliberately indifferent 
as to whether they were providing financial support to the DPR. Notably, such allegations are 
especially sufficient where the DPR has not been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. 
Plaintiffs have thus adequately pleaded the intent requirement under sections 2339A and 2339C. 
 c.  Proximate Cause                                                     

 To satisfy the ordinary tort requirement of causation and foreseeability, as well as the textual 
requirement that injury be suffered “by reason of” an act of international terrorism, plaintiffs must 
plead that an alleged act of international terrorism proximately caused their injury. § 2333(a); Boim 
III, 549 F.3d at 691–98; Biton v. Palestinian Interim Self-Gov’t Auth., 310 F. Supp. 2d 172, 182 
(D.D.C. 2004) (citing Boim I, 291 F.3d at 1011–12 (interpreting “by reason of” language of § 
2333(a) as requiring showing that defendant's actions proximately caused plaintiffs' injuries)). 
“Foreseeability is the cornerstone of proximate cause, and in tort law, a defendant will be held 
liable only for those injuries that might have reasonably been anticipated as a natural consequence 
of the defendant's actions.” Biton, 310 F. Supp. 2d at 182.               
 Regarding whether events are reasonably foreseeable, the Second Circuit has opined that,  

    Assessment of what an observer could reasonably find “appear[ed] to be intended” 
    depends on whether the consequences of the defendant's activities were reasonably 
    foreseeable, see, e.g., Boim v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief & Development, 
    549 F.3d 685, 693-94 (7th Cir. 2008), and reasonable foreseeability depends largely 
    on what the defendant knew, see id. (“A knowing donor” to an FTO--“that is a 
    donor who knew” the terroristic “aims and activities” directed at a particular 
    territory--“would know ... that donations to” the entity would enable it to “kill more 
    people in” the territory. “And given such foreseeable consequences, such donations 
    would appear to be intended ... to intimidate or coerce a civilian population or to 
    affect the conduct of a government by ... assassination, as required by section 
    2331(1) in order to distinguish terrorist acts from other violent crimes.” (internal 
    quotation marks omitted) (emphases ours)).                           

Weiss v. Nat’l Westminster Bank, PLC., 993 F.3d 144, 161 (2d Cir. 2021).  

    Defendants could have reasonably anticipated Plaintiffs’ injuries, assuming Plaintiffs’ 
allegations to be true. Defendants allegedly knew or were deliberately indifferent that they were 
providing financial services to the DPR through their charities and other intermediaries, and that 
the  DPR  used  those  services  to  buy  lethal  equipment  to  carry  out  their  terroristic 
activities. See Intent discussion supra.                                  
    Moreover, the lack of direct transfers to the DPR for the specific attack on MH17 is not 
dispositive of proximate cause. See Strauss v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., 925 F. Supp. 2d 414, 433 
(E.D.N.Y. 2013) (Strauss I) (“[P]laintiffs who bring an ATA action are not required to trace 
specific dollars to specific attacks to satisfy the proximate cause standard. Such a task would be 
impossible and would make the ATA practically dead letter because ‘[m]oney is fungible.’”). 
    In light of these allegations, Plaintiffs have adequately pleaded facts alleging Defendants’ 
proximate causation of Plaintiffs’ injuries. See Weiss, 453 F. Supp. 2d at 632 (concluding that 
plaintiffs plead proximate cause where they alleged that bank provided financial services to 
terrorists before terrorist attack).                                      
 d.  Act of War exception                                                
    Congress has, however, precluded claims for injury resulting from an act of war: “No 
action shall be maintained under section 2333 of this title for injury or loss by reason of an act of 
war.” 18 U.S.C. § 2336(a). In order to state a claim for civil damages under Section 2333(a), 

plaintiffs must allege that the decedents were injured “by reason of” acts of “international 
terrorism.” Defendants argue that the DPR is a military force, engaged in armed conflict in 
Ukraine. Therefore, since MH17 was downed during this armed conflict, Plaintiffs’ claims are 
barred by the ATA’s act of war exclusion. The issue before the court, therefore, is whether this 
legal conclusion is supported by plaintiffs’ factual allegations.         
The ATA defines “act of war” to mean any act occurring in the course of-  

    (A) declared war;                                                    
    (B) armed conflict, whether or not war has been declared, between two or more 
    nations; or                                                          
    (C) armed conflict between military forces of any origin.            

18 U.S.C. § 2331(4).                                                      

    Defendants’ submissions focus on (B) and (C); therefore, the Court’s analysis shall focus 
on whether the DPR is a military force. The Complaint alleges that MH17 was downed by the 
DPR, a terrorist group based on an ideology of Russian supremacy by creating a proto-state, 
Novorossiya, through the control of territory in Ukraine. Am. Compl. ¶ 88. The DPR has not been 
designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. There is a lack of authority on whether a non-
designated terrorist organization can constitute a “military force” for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 
2331(4)(C). Courts have opined that:                                      
    “there  are  undoubtedly  differences  between  military  forces  and  terrorists.  A 
    conventional dictionary definition of “military” is “armed forces” or the persons 
    serving in them. “Armed forces,” in turn, are “the combined military, naval, and air 
    forces of a nation.” In  contrast, “terrorism” is  conventionally defined  as “the 
    systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion.” “Terror” itself is defined 
     as  “violent  or  destructive  acts  (as  bombing)  committed  by groups in  order to 
     intimidate a population or government into granting their demands.”” 
Weiss v. Arab Bank, PLC, No. 06 CV 1623, 2007 WL 4565060, at *3—-5 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 
2007) 
     The DPR, as Plaintiffs allege it to be, is a terrorist group operating in eastern Ukraine that 
acquired that territory through force and intimidation, and the DPR continues to engage in violent 
acts against civilians, which often includes torture and murder. Second Am. Compl. 4 1, 88-101. 
Thus, as alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, which the Court assumes as true for the 
purposes of this motion, the DPR is not a nation with armed forces. Rather, the DPR is a  terrorist 
group that uses intimidation and violence attacks against citizens, as it did when it downed MH17. 
Therefore, the Court finds that based on the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, the 
DPR is not a military force or nation for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 2331 (4)(B) and (4)(C). 
                                  CONCLUSION 
     For the aforementioned reasons, Plaintiffs’ have adequately pleaded claims pursuant to 18 
ULS.C.  §§  2331,  2339A,  and  2339C.  Therefore,  Defendants’  motions  to  dismiss  the  second 
amended complaint are denied. (ECF Nos. 160, 165, 168.)
