outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Association to Preserve and Protect Local Livelihoods et al. and Penobscot Bay and River Pilots Association''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the Bar Harbor Ordinance is preempted by federal law under the Supremacy Clause, including federal maritime, immigration, and environmental regulations, because it imposes additional conditions on entry into the United States and conflicts with federal regulatory schemes governing vessel operations, seafarer shore access, and anchorage rights.

  2. Appellants contended that the Ordinance is preempted by the Maine State Pilotage Act and other Maine statutes, as it exceeds the municipality''s Home Rule authority and frustrates state-level coordination of economic development and pilotage regulation.

  3. Appellants argued that the Ordinance violates the Dormant Commerce Clause by discriminating against interstate and foreign commerce, specifically by targeting cruise ships (which are predominantly out-of-state) and favoring local hotels and inns, and by imposing a substantial burden on the continuous flow of interstate commerce without sufficient justification.

  4. Appellants contended that the Ordinance imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce under Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., because its burdens on cruise ship visitation and related commerce are clearly excessive in relation to any putative local benefits.

  5. Appellants argued that the Ordinance violates the Due Process Clause by unreasonably depriving them of property interests, including U.S. Coast Guard approvals, and by lacking a rational relationship to a legitimate local purpose.

  6. Appellants objected to the district court''s refusal to enjoin the Ordinance in its entirety based on federal preemption of seafarer shore access regulations, arguing that partial relief was insufficient.

  7. Appellants asserted that the district court erred by not addressing their right-to-travel claim under the Commerce Clause.


  === Charles Sidman''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. Cross-appellant argued that the district court erred in holding that the Ordinance is preempted by federal maritime security regulations to the extent it prevents seafarers from gaining access to shore, contending that no such preemption exists and that the Ordinance should be upheld in full.'
