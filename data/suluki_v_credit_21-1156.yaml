outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Khalilah Suluki''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Suluki argued that the district court erred by concluding that Credit One would not have come to a different conclusion had it conducted a reasonable investigation into her identity theft dispute under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

  2. Suluki contended that the district court erred in holding that Credit One did not willfully violate the FCRA.

  3. Suluki argued that Credit One took a ''cookie-cutter'' approach to investigating her dispute by concluding its inquiry after finding only two ''superficial links'' between her and the account, and that a reasonable investigation would have led to a finding that the account was fraudulent or at least unverifiable.

  4. Suluki challenged the district court''s determination that she was not entitled to damages because no reasonable jury could find that Credit One willfully or negligently violated the FCRA.

  5. Suluki argued that Credit One failed to consider various pieces of information, including her affidavit, direct links to her mother in the account information, and evidence that her mother was actively using the credit card, which she claimed would have resulted in a different investigative result.

  6. Suluki asserted that Credit One willfully violated the FCRA by following a rigid ''blueprint'' for its investigations and not sufficiently changing its investigative procedures after a federal judge found its processes to be unreasonable.

  7. Suluki, joined by the CFPB and FTC as amici, argued that she could have established actual damages under 15 U.S.C. § 1681o by Credit One''s continued inclusion of unverified information on her consumer report.'
