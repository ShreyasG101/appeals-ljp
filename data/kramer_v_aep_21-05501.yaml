reason_for_appeal: '=== Derek Kramer''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Kramer argued that the district court erred by limiting the scope of discovery on his ERISA denial-of-benefits claim, specifically by denying his motion to compel production of nearly 300 documents withheld by AEP and the Plan under the attorney-client privilege, contending that the fiduciary exception applied and required disclosure.

  2. Kramer further contended that he was entitled to "full discovery" on his ERISA denial-of-benefits claim beyond the administrative record, asserting that existing Sixth Circuit precedent limiting discovery to procedural issues had been implicitly abrogated by the Supreme Court and that, in any event, broader discovery should have been allowed into his procedural allegations.

  3. Kramer claimed that the district court erred in striking his jury-trial demand, asserting that he had a Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial on his ERISA denial-of-benefits claim under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B), and that this provision provides for legal, not purely equitable, relief.

  4. Kramer argued that the district court erred in granting judgment to AEP and the Plan on his denial-of-benefits claim, asserting that the court should not have applied the arbitrary-and-capricious standard but instead should have treated the case under Rule 56 summary-judgment procedures and standards.

  5. Kramer contended that the district court violated the party-presentation principle by recharacterizing AEP and the Plan’s motion for summary judgment as a motion for judgment on the administrative record, rather than adjudicating it as a Rule 56 motion as framed by the parties.

  6. Kramer argued that the district court should not have followed the Wilkins procedures for adjudicating ERISA denial-of-benefits claims because, in his view, the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Tsarnaev implicitly abrogated Wilkins and precluded the Sixth Circuit from imposing such supervisory rules.

  7. Kramer asserted that, even under Rule 56, he had created a genuine dispute of material fact that should have precluded the entry of judgment in favor of AEP and the Plan on his denial-of-benefits claim.'
