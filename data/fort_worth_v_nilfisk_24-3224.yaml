outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Nilfisk, Inc. and Nilfisk Holding A/S''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Nilfisk argued that Fort Worth Partners’ breach of contract claim was barred by the statute of limitations because the cause of action accrued in 2016 when Nilfisk first procured and provided a deficient insurance policy and certificate of insurance.

  2. Nilfisk contended that the doctrine of avoidable consequences barred Fort Worth Partners from recovering damages because Fort Worth Partners could have reasonably avoided its harm by exercising its contractual right to purchase additional insurance on the Building and charge the cost to Nilfisk as additional rent.

  3. Nilfisk asserted that the district court’s award of damages for so‑called unrebutted costs was erroneous because its expert, Marcussen, had in fact rebutted each of the damages categories calculated by Fort Worth Partners’ expert, McMahon, so the unrebutted costs award was not supported by the record.


  === Fort Worth Partners, LLC''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. Fort Worth Partners argued that the district court misinterpreted the Lease by excluding all damages to the Building’s foundation from the full replacement cost calculation, and that under Section 10.2 only the below‑grade portions of the footings, foundations, and other structures were to be excluded, leaving above‑grade foundation components compensable.

  2. Fort Worth Partners contended that the district court further misinterpreted the Lease by treating damage to the foundation as subject only to a repair remedy rather than a full replacement remedy, thereby improperly limiting recoverable damages for foundation damage.

  3. Fort Worth Partners argued that the district court abused its discretion by reducing its attorney’s fees award based on a finding of only limited success on its claims, asserting that the degree of its success did not justify the 25 percent reduction applied to the lodestar amount.'
