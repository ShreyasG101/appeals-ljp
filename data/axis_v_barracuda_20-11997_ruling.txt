                  MEMORANDUM & ORDER                                 
GORTON, J.                                                                
This case arises out of a 2018 data breach that compromised          
the protected health information of more than 277,000 patients            
of Zoll Services LLC, a subsidiary of Zoll Medical (together,             
“Zoll”).  Pending before the Court is the motion of defendant             
Barracuda Network, Inc. (“Barracuda”) for summary judgment on             
three claims, which survived a motion to dismiss, brought by              
plaintiff Axis Insurance Co. (“Axis”), as assignee of Zoll and            
subrogee of Fusion LLC (“Fusion”).  For the reasons that follow,          
the motion will be allowed.                                               
I.   Background                                                           
This Court has recited the lengthy and complex background            
of this action in its prior memoranda and orders. See, e.g.,              
Axis Ins. Co. v. Barracuda Networks, Inc., No. CV 20-11997-NMG,           
2024 WL 3458143, at *1 (D. Mass. July 17, 2024); Axis Ins. Co.            
v. Barracuda Networks, Inc., No. CV 20-11997-NMG, 2023 WL                 
2838380, at *1-*2 (D. Mass. Apr. 7, 2023).  The following                 
addresses only the background relevant to the pending motion.             

A.  Factual Background                                               
Fusion sells hosted business communications products. In             
2012, a company that is now a subsidiary of Fusion entered into           
an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) agreement with a               
company that has since merged with Barracuda.  The OEM agreement          
provided for customer communications and email management                 

software and related services.  At approximately the same time,           
Fusion entered a Hosting Services Agreement (“HSA”) with Zoll             
that would provide Zoll with cloud-based messaging software and           
services for electronic messages and email communications.                
In 2018, a Barracuda employee allegedly left a data port in          
its system open during a standard data migration in its network.          
In the approximately seven weeks before the error was detected,           
protected health information (“PHI”) from Zoll patients was               
apparently accessed by unauthorized third parties.  In early              
2019, Barracuda advised Fusion of the breach, although Fusion             
claims Barracuda misrepresented its magnitude and the prior               
existence of “reasonable and readily available security                   
protocols and products.”                                                  
B. Procedural Background                                             

In 2020, Zoll filed an action against Barracuda in this              
Court, asserting claims for negligence, breach of implied                 
warranties, breach of contract, and equitable indemnification.            
Fusion was allowed to intervene in this case under Fed. R. Civ.           
P. 20 and proceeded to bring actions for breach of contract,              
breach of the covenant of good faith, negligent                           
misrepresentation, tortious interference and equitable                    
indemnification.  In a previous order, the Court dismissed all            

of those claims except Zoll’s claim of equitable indemnification          
and Fusion’s claims of breach of contract and breach of the               
covenant of good faith.                                                   
Pursuant to a previous arbitration settlement, any claims            
Zoll and Fusion had against Barracuda in connection with the              
data breach were assigned to Axis.  Axis, the only remaining              
party in interest, was substituted as plaintiff in 2022, at               
which time Fusion and Zoll were dismissed as parties.                     
Now, Barracuda moves for summary judgment against Axis               
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 on the three remaining claims.                   
III. Motion for Summary Judgment                                          
Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, summary judgment is warranted              
where “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact” and             

thus “the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of           
law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,               
Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986).  A fact is “material” if it “is           
one that affects the outcome of the suit,” id. at 48; see Patco           
Constr. Co. v. People’s United Bank, 683 F.3d 197, 207 (1st Cir.          
2012), and a “genuine issue” exists as to that material fact if           
“there is sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual              
dispute,” Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.           
1990).  For a claim to survive summary judgment, the plaintiff            
must provide a sufficient evidentiary basis to establish each             
essential element of the claims at issue. Katz v. Belveron Real           

Est. Partners, LLC, 28 F.4th 300, 307 (1st Cir. 2022).                    
A. Equitable Indemnification                                         
Barracuda first asserts that Zoll’s equitable                        
indemnification claim fails as a matter of law because Zoll               
lacks a “special relationship” with Barracuda and,                        
alternatively, because Zoll is a party at fault and therefore             

lacks “clean hands” to seek equitable indemnification.                    
A valid claim of indemnification can arise under                     
Massachusetts law in one of three circumstances: 1) where there           
is an express contractual agreement to indemnify, 2) where an             
agreement to indemnify can be “implied from the nature of the             
relationship between the parties,” or 3) where there is “a tort           
based right to indemnification” based on “a great disparity in            
the fault of the parties.” Araujo v. Woods Hole, Martha’s                 

Vineyard, Nantucket S.S. Auth., 693 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1982).            
The claim at issue concerns only the third circumstance, a tort-          
based, or equitable, right of indemnification.                            
Equitable indemnification allows a party “who is without             
fault, compelled by operation of law to defend himself against            
the wrongful act of another, to recover from the wrongdoer the            
entire amount of the loss.” Santos v. Chrysler Corp., 715 N.E.2d          
47, 62 (Mass. 1999).  An equitable indemnification claim does             
not require proof of a contractual relationship between the               
parties. Fireside Motors, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A.,           
479 N.E.2d 1386, 1388 (Mass. 1985).  Instead, it arises under             
equitable principals and is available where there is a                    

“derivative or vicarious relationship” between the indemnitor             
and indemnitee. Santos, 715 N.E.2d at 62; see Wade v. Touchdown           
Realty Grp., LLC, 386 F. Supp. 3d 56, 67 (D. Mass. 2019) (“[T]he          
right to indemnity is limited to those cases where the                    
person . . . is held derivatively or vicariously liable for the           
wrongful act of another.” (emphasis omitted) (quoting Ferreira            
v. Chrysler Grp. LLC, 13 N.E.3d 561, 567 (Mass. 2014)).1                  
Derivative or vicarious liability can emerge only “because of             
the relationship between the two parties.” Chapman v. Finnegan,           
950 F. Supp. 2d 285, 292 n.4 (D. Mass. 2013).                             
Here, nothing in the record suggests that Zoll and                   

Barracuda shared any relationship recognized under Massachusetts          
law as giving rise to derivative or vicarious liability.  The             
relationship at issue between Zoll and Barracuda can best be              
described as one of an independent contractor.  As Barracuda              
contends, the OEM agreement between the parties established that          
Zoll operated as an independent contractor, not as an agent.              
While not dispositive, the inclusion of a provision that a party          
is an independent contractor is significant evidence that the             
parties’ relationship is as such.  See Theos & Sons, Inc. v.              
Mack Trucks, Inc., 729 N.E.2d 1113, 1120 (Mass. 2000).  Axis              
makes no claim that Zoll was anything more than an independent            
contractor to Barracuda.                                                  

Barracuda’s status as an independent contractor with                 
respect to Zoll fails to create derivative or vicarious                   
liability to those with whom Barracuda contracts.  See Lyon v.            

1 Contrary to Barracuda’s assertion, an equitable                    
indemnification claim does not require a “special relationship”           
between the parties to be actionable.  Cf. Arujo, 693 F.2d at 3.          
(requiring “special relationship between the parties” for                 
“implied contract” indemnification claim); Decker v. Black &              
Decker Mfg. Co., 449 N.E.2d 641, 643 (Mass. 1983) (same).                 
Morphew, 678 N.E.2d 1306, 1310 (Mass. 1997) (“In general, an              
employer of an independent contractor is not liable for harm              
caused to another by the independent contractor’s negligence.”);          
see also Decker, 449 N.E.2d at 643 (holding that relationship             
between manufacturer and supplier of equipment does not give              

rise to vicarious or derivative liability necessary for                   
equitable indemnification claim).  Axis makes no claim that               
derivative liability exists here even in spite of the                     
independent contract status. Cf. Lyon, 678 N.E.2d at 1310                 
(stating independent contractor status can give rise to                   
derivative liability where there is evidence of employer control          
over independent contractor).                                             
Axis likewise does not contend that Barracuda shared with            
Zoll any other form of recognized relationship that would create          
the derivative or vicarious liability necessary for a viable              
equitable indemnification claim. See Leonard v. Lumbermens Mut.           
Cas. Co., 10 N.E.2d 469, 470 (Mass. 1937) (recognizing existence          

of derivative liability based on agency relationship); see also           
Hollywood Barbecue Co. v. Morse, 50 N.E.2d 55, 56 (Mass. 1943)            
(recognizing derivative liability arising from master-servant             
relationship); Tenedios v. Wm. Filene’s Sons Co., 20 Mass. App.           
Ct. 252, 257, 479 N.E.2d 723, 727 (1985) (recognizing derivative          
liability based on employer and employee relationship); accord            
McGuire v. Reilly, 271 F. Supp. 2d 335, 342 (D. Mass. 2003),              
aff’d, 386 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2004) (stressing that summary                
judgment is “appropriate” where “the nonmoving party fails to             
show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact” in                
record).                                                                  
Because the absence of a relationship that would legally             

give rise to vicarious or derivative liability negates Axis’s             
equitable indemnification claim, the Court need not address               
Barracuda’s argument that Axis cannot recover because Zoll                
lacked “clean hands.”2  While the Court previously determined             
that Zoll had sufficiently pled that its fault was “vicarious in          
nature” at the motion to dismiss stage, Zoll Med. Corp. v.                
Barracuda Networks, Inc., 565 F. Supp. 3d 101, 110 (D. Mass.              
2021), the absence of evidence of such a relationship that would          
give rise to vicarious or derivative liability at the summary             
judgment stage is dispositive.  See Chapman v. Bernard’s Inc.,            
198 F.R.D. 575, 579 (D. Mass. 2001) (allowing summary judgment            
on equitable indemnification claim because would-be indemnitor            


2 The Court recognizes that sources conflict as to whether           
Massachusetts law requires a party be without fault before                
claiming equitable indemnification or simply be less culpable             
than the indemnitor. Compare Stewart v. Roy Bros. Inc., 265               
N.E.2d 357, 365 (Mass. 1970) (holding that equitable                      
indemnification is available only where indemnitee “does not              
join in the negligent act”), with Rathbun v. W. Mass. Elec. Co.,          
395 Mass. 361, 364, 479 N.E.2d 1383, 1385 (1985) (finding no              
“general rule” as to whether negligent indemnitee can recover             
and noting that some prior cases have allowed negligent                   
indemnitee to prevail).                                                   
was “not an agent of [indemnitee], nor d[id] it have a                    
relationship . . . from which it could be held vicariously or             
derivatively liable for the actions of [indemnitor]” and                  
therefore [indemnitee] was “not entitled to indemnification from          
[indemnitor] under any circumstances.”); see also Walter &                

Shuffain, P.C. v. CPA Mut. Ins. Co. of Am. Risk Retention Grp.,           
660 F. Supp. 2d 116, 126 (D. Mass. 2009) (dismissing equitable            
indemnification claim because nonmoving party “ha[d] not alleged          
any facts establishing a relationship . . . that would give rise          
to vicarious or derivative liability”).                                   
B. Breach of Contract                                                

Barracuda next contends that Fusion’s breach of contract             
claim fails as a matter of law because Axis cannot prove that             
Barracuda waived the conditions precedent in the OEM agreement,           
which this Court previously determined Fusion failed to fulfill.          
One such condition required Fusion to include limitation of               
liability and indemnification provisions in its customer                  
contracts.                                                                
Under Massachusetts law, a contractual condition precedent           
is “an event [that] must occur before a contract becomes                  
effective or before an obligation to perform arises.” Sands v.            
Ridefilm Corp., 212 F.3d 657, 661-62 (1st Cir. 2000).  If a               
condition precedent is not satisfied, the contract and the                
obligations therein cannot be enforced. Mass. Mun. Wholesale              
Elec. Co. v. Town of Danvers, 577 N.E.2d 283, 288 (Mass. 1991).           
It is well settled that conditions precedent can be waived.          
See Millen Indus., Inc. v. Flexo-Accessories Co., 5 F. Supp. 2d           
72, 74 (D. Mass. 1998) (“A condition precedent in favor of one            

of the parties may be waived by that party.”).  Waiver occurs             
when a party voluntarily relinquishes a known right.  Bos.                
Helicopter Charter, Inc. v. Augusta Aviation Corp., 767 F. Supp.          
363, 372 (D. Mass. 1991).  A waiver is voluntary if the party             
either expressly or impliedly manifests intent to surrender a             
right and no other reasonable explanation exists for that                 
surrender, which requires “clear, decisive and unequivocal                
conduct.” Bachoroz v. Miller-Forslund, 703 F.3d 27, 32-33 (1st            
Cir. 2012); Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec.             
Co., 840 F.2d 985, 992 (1st Cir. 1988) (emphasis omitted).                
Silence, generally, is insufficient to support waiver. Dunkin’            
Donuts Inc. v. Panagakos, 5 F. Supp. 2d 57, 61 (D. Mass. 1998).           

Determining “[w]hether a condition precedent has been                
waived” is usually “a question of fact.”  Millen Indus., Inc., 5          
F. Supp. 2d at 74; see Wildlands Tr. of Se. Mass., Inc. v. Cedar          
Hill Retreat Ctr., Inc., 160 N.E.3d 297, 305 n.12 (Mass. App.             
Ct. 2020).  Here, the facts are clear that the subject OEM                
agreement contains an anti-waiver provision stating that                  
No failure or delay of [Barracuda] in exercising any right           
or remedy under this [OEM a]greement shall operate as a              
waiver of such right.                                                

Although this provision may serve as evidence that inaction by            
Barracuda does not constitute waiver, the existence of an anti-           
waiver provision under Massachusetts law is “not dispositive,”            
and it remains a question of fact whether waiver has in fact              
occurred.  Wildlands, 160 N.E.3d at 305 n.12.3                            
Barracuda contends that no evidence demonstrates a clear             
and unequivocal intent to waive the OEM’s condition precedent to          
overcome this operative provision.  Axis posits that Barracuda            
has failed to act on its right to audit Fusion’s customer                 
contracts, a right it claims Barracuda held under the terms of            
the OEM agreement.  Silence alone does not, however, preclude             
Barracuda from summary judgment on this claim. See Dunkin’                
Donuts Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (“[I]t is doubtful that mere             
silence could satisfy [the] burden of establishing clear,                 
decisive, and unequivocal conduct.” (internal quotations                  
omitted)); cf. KACT, Inc. v. Rubin, 819 N.E.2d 610, 616 (Mass.            

3 A previous session of this Court treated anti-waiver               
clauses as determinative to preventing waiver, see Blue Hills             
Office Park LLC v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, 477 F. Supp. 2d 366,           
374 (D. Mass. 2007), but this session disagrees with that                 
conclusion based upon controlling Massachusetts case law, see             
M.J.G. Properties, Inc. v. Hurley, 537 N.E.2d 165, 167 (Mass.             
App. Ct. 1989) (“[W]e think the proper approach, and one which            
is in accord with our cases, is to look at the question of                
waiver as a question of fact in light of all the circumstances,           
including the existence of the anti[-]waiver clause.”).                   
App. Ct. 2004) (finding waiver where party “did more than remain          
silent”).  Without more, evidence of Barracuda’s inaction and             
lack of inquiry as to its rights under the condition is                   
insufficient to raise a dispute of fact as to whether                     
Barracuda’s conduct showed a clear, unequivocal intent to waive.          

Cf. J.H. Lynch & Sons, Inc. v. Shaw’s Supermarkets, Inc., No. CV          
05-12445-JGD, 2008 WL 11388729, at *8 (D. Mass. Feb. 15, 2008)            
(finding allegations of waiver sufficient to survive summary              
judgment where evidence showed party actively approved payment            
agreements despite condition precedent to the contrary).                  
Nevertheless, Axis claims Barracuda cannot rely on waiver            
to defeat the breach of contract claim under the doctrine of              
equitable estoppel, based on Barracuda’s failure to inquire               
about whether Fusion was in compliance.  To invoke equitable              
estoppel, Axis must establish that Barracuda made a                       
representation that was intended to induce a course of conduct            
by Fusion and that Fusion did reasonably rely on that conduct to          

its detriment.  Dunkin’ Donuts Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d at 62                  
(“Although estoppel can be based on mere silence, that is true            
only where there is a duty to speak . . . .”).  Axis, however,            
has not shown that Barracuda was duty-bound to inquire whether            
Fusion was complying with the condition precedent rather than             
remain silent.  Thus, the failure to inquire is not grounds for           
equitable estoppel.                                                       
C. Breach of Covenant                                                
Finally, Barracuda claims Axis is unable to prove its claim          
of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because          

it impermissibly seeks to expand Barracuda’s obligations under            
the contract.                                                             
Every contract governed under Massachusetts law contains an          
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Ayash v. Dana-           
Farber Cancer Inst., 822 N.E.2d 667, 683 (Mass. 2005).  That              
covenant reflects an implicit condition that neither party                
“shall do anything that will have the effect of destroying or             
injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of            
the contract.” Galvin v. U.S. Bank Nat. Ass’n, No. CIV.A. 14-             
14723, 2015 WL 1014549, at *4 (D. Mass. Mar. 9, 2015) (citing             
Anthony’s Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., 583 N.E.2d 806 (Mass.           

1991)), aff’d sub nom. Galvin v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 852 F.3d 146            
(1st Cir. 2017)).  To show breach of covenant, a plaintiff must           
demonstrate that “there existed an enforceable contract between           
the two parties” and “the defendant did something that had the            
effect of destroying . . . the right of [the plaintiff] to                
receive the fruits of the contract.” Laser Labs, Inc. v. ETL              
Testing Lab’ys, Inc., 29 F. Supp. 2d 21, 24 (D. Mass. 1998)               
(internal quotations omitted).  Thus, the covenant cannot be              
used to “create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in           
the existing contractual relationship.” Ayash, 822 N.E.2d at 684          
(quotations omitted); see MacKenzie v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 738            
F.3d 486, 493 (1st Cir. 2013) (“The concept of good faith is              
shaped by the nature of the contractual relationship and the              
scope of the covenant is only as broad as the contract . . . .”           
(quotations omitted)).                                                    

Allegations that a party breached the covenant of good               
faith and fair dealing is “ordinarily a question of fact to be            
determined by the jury.”  Wilder v. Toyota Fin. Servs. Americas           
Corp., 764 F. Supp. 2d 249, 259 (D. Mass. 2011).  This case,              
however, presents an exception.  Because the covenant of good             
faith cannot be used to create rights that do not exist in the            
contractual relationship, see Ayash, 822 N.E.2d at 684, Axis              
must demonstrate some contractual right to which Fusion is                
entitled in the event of a data breach.  No evidence of such was          
produced during discovery.  As Barracuda articulates, its OEM             
agreement with Fusion contains no provision regarding any                 
actions that must be taken in response to a data breach.4  As             

such, Axis cannot rely on an implied duty of good faith to                
create a new obligation where one does not exist under the terms          
of their agreement.  See Lohnes v. Level 3 Commc’ns, Inc., 272            
F.3d 49, 62 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that defendant did not               
violate covenant of good faith by failing to provide notice of a          

4  By contrast, Fusion’s agreement with Zoll contains                
detailed language concerning such events.                                 
stock split because defendant was “not contractually bound to             
provide the appellant with individualized notice of the stock             
split”).                                                                  
That the breach of covenant claim rests mainly on                    
Barracuda’s alleged inaction further demonstrates why the claim           

cannot survive a motion for summary judgment.  Inaction                   
constitutes “a lack of good faith . . . only when the                     
contracting party had a duty to act,” and no such duty exists             
under this agreement.  Uno Rests., Inc. v. Bos. Kenmore Realty            
Corp., 805 N.E.2d 957, 965 (D. Mass. 2004).  In response, Axis            
makes no attempt to refute Barracuda’s argument, and Barracuda            
is therefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim.  See             
Boyle v. Douglas Dynamics, LLC, 292 F. Supp. 2d 198, 210 (D.              
Mass. 2003), aff’d, 99 F. App’x 243 (1st Cir. 2004) (rejecting            
breach of covenant claim where party “did not have an                     
enforceable right” in question under agreement); see also                 
Piantes v. Pepperidge Farm, Inc., 875 F. Supp. 929, 938 (D.               

Mass. 1995) (rejecting breach of covenant claim because contract          
did not provide plaintiff franchise distributor with right                
through which to assert breach of good faith and fair dealing.

For the foregoing reasons, the motion of defendant,                  
Barracuda Networks, Inc., for summary judgment is ALLOWED.                

So ordered.

GORTON, J.                                                                
    This case arises out of a data breach which compromised              
certain confidential, protected health information (“PHI”) of             
more than 277,000 patients of Zoll Services LLC, an indirect              
subsidiary of Zoll Medical (together, “Zoll”).  Pending before            
the Court is the motion of defendants Barracuda Networks, Inc.            
("Barracuda") and Sonian, Inc. (“Sonian” and together,                    
“defendants”) for judgment on the pleadings (Docket No. 128).             
For the reasons that follow, the motion will be denied.                   
I.   Background                                                           
    The Court has recited the lengthy and complex background of          
this action in its prior memoranda and orders of which the                
parties are undoubtedly well-aware. See Zoll Med. Corp. v.                
Barracuda Networks, Inc., 585 F. Supp. 3d 128, 133-34 (D. Mass.           
2022); Zoll Med. Corp. v. Barracuda Networks, Inc., 2021 U.S.             
Dist. LEXIS 180761 at *2-6 (D. Mass. Sept. 21, 2021).  The Court          
will therefore address only the factual and procedural                    
background of particular relevance to the pending motion.                 
      A. Factual Background                                              
    Rule 20 plaintiff Fusion, LLC (“Fusion” or “plaintiff”) is           

a company that provides hosted business communications products.          
In 2012, Apptix, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Fusion) contracted             
with Sonian (which has merged with Barracuda) to provide its              
customers with software and related services for the management           
of customer communications and emails (“the OEM Agreement”).1  At         
about the same time, Fusion entered into a Hosting Services               
Agreement (“the HSA”) with Zoll to provide it with hosted                 
communications services.                                                  
    In November, 2018, a Barracuda employee allegedly left a             
data port open in its system during a standard migration of data          
within its network.  In the approximately seven weeks until the           

error was detected, the PHI of Zoll patients was apparently               
accessed by unauthorized third parties.  Barracuda advised                
Fusion of the data breach in January, 2019, although Fusion               
contends that Barracuda misrepresented the extent of the breach.          
Fusion also alleges that Barracuda misrepresented that its data           


1 Although plaintiff does not define “OEM,” the Court understands that it 
generally refers to “original equipment manufacturer.”                    
management enabled customers 1) to identify and reduce risks and          
2) to provide “reasonable and readily available security                  
protocols and products.”                                                  

    B.  Procedural Background                                            
    In June, 2019, Fusion filed for bankruptcy protection under          
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in                        
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of           
New York. A reorganization plan was confirmed in January, 2020.           
    The plan allowed Zoll to seek damages from Fusion for harm           

suffered as a result of the data breach “to the extent of                 
available insurance coverage and proceeds.”                               
    Zoll initiated arbitration with Fusion in March, 2020,               
asserting claims for negligence and breach of contract.  Zoll             
also attempted to assert claims against Barracuda which were              
dismissed for lack of privity.  Zoll’s insurer, Ace American              
Insurance Co. (“Ace”), paid Zoll on its claims for damages                
incurred due to the data breach and was subrogated as the real            
party in interest in the arbitration.  Fusion’s insurer, Axis             
Insurance Co. (“Axis”), confirmed coverage of claims against              
Fusion related to the data breach and provided a defense against          
those claims.                                                             

    In November, 2020, Zoll initiated this action against                
Barracuda in the District of Massachusetts.  Fusion moved to              
intervene as a Rule 20 party shortly thereafter and its motion            
was allowed in June, 2021.                                                
     Zoll, Ace, Fusion and Axis settled the claims at issue in            
their arbitration in November, 2021.  Pursuant to their                   
settlement, any claims that Zoll/Ace had against Barracuda in             
connection with the data breach were assigned to Axis and any             

such claims that Fusion had were subrogated to Axis.  Axis, the           
remaining real party in interest in the case at bar, was                  
substituted as the plaintiff in April, 2022, at which time                
Fusion and Zoll were dismissed as parties.                                
     Now, Barracuda moves for judgment on the pleadings                   
principally contending that Fusion’s claims should be estopped.           

II.   Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings                                 
     A. Legal Standard                                                    
     A motion for judgment on the pleadings is governed by the            
same legal standard as a motion to dismiss for failure to state           

a claim except that the Court considers the pleadings as a                
whole. Aponte–Torres v. University of Puerto Rico, 445 F.3d 50,           
54-55 (1st Cir. 2006).                                                    
     To survive such a motion, the subject pleading must contain          
sufficient factual matter to state a claim for relief that is             
actionable as a matter of law and “plausible on its face.”                
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl.            
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  A claim is                  
facially plausible if, after accepting as true all non-                   
conclusory factual allegations, the court can draw the                    
reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the                 
misconduct alleged. Ocasio-Hernandez v. Fortuno-Burset, 640 F.3d          
1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011).                                                    

    In considering the merits of such a motion, the Court must           
accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw          
all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. R.G. Fin.             
Corp. v. Vergara-Nunez, 446 F.3d 178, 182 (1st Cir. 2006).  The           
Court may also consider documents if 1) the parties do not                
dispute their authenticity, 2) they are “central to the                   
plaintiffs' claim” or 3) they are “sufficiently referred to in            
the complaint.” Curran v. Cousins, 509 F.3d 36, 44 (1st Cir.              
2007) (quoting Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.                 
1993)).                                                                   
    B. Analysis                                                          

    The motion is suffused with equitable concerns.  Defendants          
move for judgment on the pleadings based on judicial estoppel.            
They contend that the failure of plaintiff to disclose the                
claims in the instant case in its 2019 bankruptcy proceeding              
constitutes an assertion that those claims do not exist and               
thus, are barred by judicial estoppel.                                    
    Plaintiff rejoins that defendants have been unscrupulous             
themselves in disclosing necessary information, namely, that              
they failed to cite estoppel among the affirmative defenses in            
their answer or raise estoppel in their motion to dismiss.  That          
oversight, according to plaintiff, constitutes a prejudicial              
surprise and contravenes the obligation under Fed. R. Civ. P.             

8(c)(1) to state all affirmative defenses, including estoppel.            
         1. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction                                  
    Before addressing the competing equities, the Court is               
obliged to respond to defendant’s assertion that judicial                 
estoppel is not waivable when it relates to subject matter                
jurisdiction.  Defendants are correct that “subject-matter                
jurisdiction cannot be waived or created by acquiescence,” see            
Sexual Minorities Uganda v. Lively, 899 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.             
2018), but that does not mean that all estoppel defenses negate           
subject-matter jurisdiction.                                              
    In Lively, for example, judicial estoppel was invoked to             

prevent plaintiff from contradicting his assertion in prior               
litigation that diversity jurisdiction was wanting. Id.  By               
contrast, the purported contradictory assertion at issue                  
concerns the existence of the claim itself, not the Court’s               
subject matter jurisdiction.  Accordingly, the Court will                 
consider whether defendants waived the judicial estoppel defense          
by failing to include it in their answer.                                 
         2. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)                                         
    Rule 8(c) is intended to provide both the Court and the              
parties fair warning that a line of defense will be pursued. See          
Williams v. Ashland Engineering Co., Inc., 45 F.3d 588, 593 (1st          
Cir. 1995).  There is no dispute that the defense of judicial             
estoppel is among the defenses that must be affirmatively pled            

under Rule 8(c)(1) or that Barracuda’s answer did not                     
specifically do so.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1) (listing                 
estoppel among affirmative defenses); see also Rivera-Puig v.             
Garcia-Rosario, 983 F.2d 311, 319 n.12 (1st Cir. 1992).                   
    Nonetheless, general pleadings may, under some                       
circumstances, preserve an affirmative defense. See Williams, 45          
F.3d at 593.  Here, defendants contend that their general                 
pleading that plaintiff failed to state a claim, in context,              
provided sufficient notice of their judicial estoppel defense.            
To determine whether that pleading suffices, the Court will               
assess whether plaintiff was unfairly surprised or prejudiced by          

the defense, under the totality of the circumstances. See id.             
    Defendants first gave notice of the judicial estoppel                
defense via email in August, 2023, two months before it filed             
the instant motion.  That notice came long after its motion to            
dismiss Fusion’s Rule 20 complaint was filed in June, 2021 and            
the complaint was answered in February, 2022.                             
    The delay carried well into discovery, which itself was              
delayed several times due to the protracted dispute over the              
archived emails and the subsequent motions to compel, quash and           
for a protective order.  Two weeks after defendant filed its              
motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court extended                  
discovery for the final time to January, 2024.  Accordingly, the          

18-month delay in staging the judicial estoppel defense came at           
the end of an already-extended discovery period.                          
    Defendants contend that their general pleading that                  
plaintiff failed to state a claim sufficed to state the judicial          
estoppel defense and that they “contextualized” that pleading             
with their August, 2023 email which gave specific notice of the           
judicial estoppel defense.  The Court disagrees.  The complaint           
itself mentioned the bankruptcy proceedings, which form the               
basis of the judicial estoppel defense, in only two paragraphs.           
Those paragraphs provided mere background and did not relate to           
the core allegations in the complaint.  There is little reason            

to believe that plaintiff would have “clearly anticipate[d]”              
that a judicial estoppel defense would be litigated. See                  
Williams, 45 F.3d at 593.  Accordingly, the delay constituted an          
unfair surprise.                                                          
    The Court also finds that the delay resulted in prejudice            
to plaintiff.  In determining the degree of prejudice for a               
delayed defense, courts often look to the underlying fact-                
intensiveness of the defense. See Collision Commc’n, Inc. v.              
Nokia Solutions & Networks OY, 2024 WL 531289, at * 4 (D.N.H.             
Feb. 9, 2024).  Where an affirmative defense is primarily fact-           
based, a “plaintiff is more likely to be prejudiced by an                 
untimely assertion of the defense.” Id.                                   
    Plaintiff contends that the delay prejudiced its ability to          

conduct discovery on the estoppel defense, including for                  
example, whether defendants were aware of plaintiff’s claim               
during the bankruptcy proceedings.  Defendants insist that the            
delay was not prejudicial because discovery of its earlier                
knowledge of the claims is irrelevant.  There is, according to            
defendants, no obligation to prove harm to the party asserting            
judicial estoppel.                                                        
    Enforcement of judicial estoppel depends upon the facts.             
There are two baseline facts that must be ascertained to stage a          
judicial estoppel defense: 1) facts concerning how a pending              
assertion “directly” contradicts a prior assertion and 2)                 

whether the earlier assertion was adopted by the tribunal. See            
Howell v. Town of Leyden, 335 F. Supp. 2d 248, 250-51 (D. Mass.           
2004).  The contours of the judicial estoppel doctrine, however,          
“are hazy, and there is no mechanical test for determining its            
applicability.” Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys,              
Inc. 374 F.3d 23, 33 (1st Cir. 2004).  Indeed, judicial estoppel          
is an equitable doctrine “invoked by a court at its discretion.”          
New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001) (citation                
omitted).  Accordingly, principles of fairness, such as whether           
a party received an unfair advantage as a result of the                   
inconsistent positions, frequently factor into the analysis. See          
Alternative Sys. Concepts, Inc., 374 F.3d at 33.                          
    Here, the delay was prejudicial to plaintiff’s ability to            

develop facts relevant to the judicial estoppel inquiry.  For             
example, the delay impeded the development of facts concerning            
plaintiff’s contention that its reservation of claims arising             
from its assumed executory contracts put defendants on notice.            
Whether defendants were aware of plaintiff’s claims during the            
bankruptcy proceedings is relevant to the oft-considered factor           
of whether the party asserting inconsistent positions would gain          
an unfair advantage and whether a litigant is “playing fast and           
loose with the courts.”  In re Buscone, 61 F.4th 10, 22 (1st              
Cir. 2023).                                                               
    Plaintiff has not, however, had a substantive opportunity            

to develop those other facts that may counsel against estoppel            
even if defendants are able to establish conclusively the two             
baseline factors.  Courts are not compelled to apply judicial             
estoppel every time a party takes seemingly contradictory                 
positions. See, e.g., In re Buscone, 61 F.4th 10, 26 (1st Cir.            
2023) (holding that the bankruptcy court’s denial of summary              
judgment where defendant “demonstrated the minimum requirements           
of judicial estoppel” was reasonable as “further factual                  
development will better inform the ultimate decision.”).  The             
substantial and unexplained delay in staging the judicial                 
estoppel defense has prejudiced plaintiff’s ability to respond            
to the defense in contravention of Rule 8(c).  The motion for             
judgment on the pleadings will be denied.                                 




                             ORDER                                       

    For the foregoing reasons, the motion of defendants,                 
Barracuda Networks, Inc. and Sonian Inc. (Docket No. 128), is             
DENIED.

              ORDER ON DISCOVERY MOTIONS                             
This matter is before the court on the “Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendants to 
Comply with Court Order” (Docket No. 151) and “Defendant Barracuda Networks, Inc.’s Motion 
for Leave to File Documents Under Seal for In Camera Review” (Docket No. 157).  After 
consideration of the parties’ written submissions and their oral arguments, it is hereby 
ORDERED as follows:                                                       
1.   The Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is ALLOWED.                    
     (a) Without making any determination as to the applicability of the common 
       interest doctrine, the court finds that, under the terms of the Common 
       Interest Agreement (Docket No. 168-2) and the Settlement Agreement 
       (Docket No. 61-1) entered into by Zoll Medical Corporation, Zoll Services, LLC 
       (together “Zoll”), and AXIS Insurance Company (“AXIS”), Zoll did not waive 
       any attorney-client privilege with respect to the documents it provided to 
       AXIS for review.  This is consistent with recognized principles of subrogation.  
       See American Auto. Ins. Co. v. J.P. Noonan Transp., Inc., No. 970325, 2000 
       WL 33171004, at *5 (Mass. Super. Ct. Nov. 16, 2000) (in dispute over 
       privileged communications, subrogee may assert whatever privileges that 
       subrogor could have asserted prior to subrogation).           

     (b) The court further finds that the parties are bound by the language of Section 
       14 of the “Stipulated Protective Order and Clawback Agreement” (Docket No. 
       69) entered into by AXIS and defendant Barracuda Networks, Inc. 
       (“Barracuda”).  The language is clear and unambiguous in that “[t]he 
       inadvertent production of privileged documents shall not be deemed a 
       waiver of the privilege.”  See Fed. R. Evid. 502(d) and (e).  

     (c) This court finds that AXIS’s disclosure of privileged documents in its 
       December 26, 2023 production to Barracuda was inadvertent.    

     (d) In light of the circumstances surrounding this inadvertent production to 
       Barracuda, including the number of documents inadvertently disclosed 
       relative to the volume of documents produced, the window of time during 
       which review and production took place, and the extensive privilege 
       screening process applied by AXIS, AXIS’s disclosure was neither grossly 
       negligent nor reckless so as to fall outside the ambit of the clawback 
       agreement.  See VLT, Inc. v. Lucent Technologies, Inc., No. 00-11049-PBS, 
       2003 WL 151399, at *4 (D. Mass. Jan. 21, 2003).               

     (e) Accordingly, and as agreed in open court, Barracuda shall destroy the

    This case arises out of a data breach which compromised              
certain confidential, protected health information (“PHI”) of             
more than 277,000 patients of Zoll Services LLC, an indirect              
subsidiary of Zoll Medical (together, “Zoll”).  Pending before            
the Court is the motion of defendant Barracuda Networks, Inc.             
("Barracuda") for leave to file a third-party complaint against           
Fusion LLC (“Fusion”).                                                    
I.   Background                                                           
    The Court has recited the lengthy and complex background of          
this action in its prior memoranda and orders and the parties             
are undoubtedly well-aware of it. See Zoll Med. Corp. v.                  
Barracuda Networks, Inc., 585 F. Supp. 3d 128, 133-34 (D. Mass.           
2022); Zoll Med. Corp. v. Barracuda Networks, Inc., 2021 U.S.             
Dist. LEXIS 180761 at *2-6 (D. Mass. Sept. 21, 2021).  The Court          
will therefore address only the factual and procedural                    
background of particular relevance to the pending motion.                 

    A.  Factual Background                                               
    Zoll develops and markets medical devices and software               
solutions, including the "LifeVest wearable cardioverter                  
defibrillator".  In the course of commercializing that product,           
Zoll received emails from physicians containing patient                   
information, such as patient names, addresses, demographics and           
health information. In 2012, Zoll entered into an agreement with          
Apptix, Inc. ("Apptix") whereby Apptix agreed to provide Zoll             
with a product that would safely store its emails and safeguard           
its PHI.  Apptix was later acquired by Fusion.                            
    For its part, Apptix had entered into an original equipment          
manufacturer agreement with Sonian Inc. (“Sonian”) according to           

which Sonian provided software and related services for the               
management of customer communications and email ("the OEM                 
Agreement").  Sonian was later acquired by Barracuda.  As a               
result, emails and patient PHI from Zoll were stored on                   
Barracuda’s network.                                                      
    The data breach at issue began in early November, 2018,              
when a Barracuda employee allegedly left a data port open in its          
system during a standard migration of data within its network.            
None of Barracuda's supervisory, security or oversight                    
mechanisms detected the error until approximately seven weeks             
later.  In the meantime, the confidential PHI of Zoll’s patients          
was apparently accessed by unauthorized third parties.                    

    B.  Procedural Background                                            
    In June, 2019, Fusion filed for bankruptcy protection under          
Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in            
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of           
New York.  Zoll filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy                  
proceeding shortly thereafter and, in January, 2020, Fusion’s             
bankruptcy reorganization plan became effective.  The plan                
permitted Zoll to seek damages from Fusion for harm suffered as           
a result of the data breach “to the extent of available                   
insurance coverage and proceeds.”                                         
    Zoll initiated arbitration with Fusion in March, 2020,               
asserting claims for negligence and breach of contract.  Zoll             

also attempted to assert claims against Barracuda which were              
dismissed for lack of privity.  Zoll’s insurer, Ace American              
Insurance Co. (“Ace”) paid Zoll on its claims for damages                 
incurred due to the data breach and was subrogated as the real            
party in interest in the arbitration.  Fusion’s insurer, Axis             
Insurance Co. (“Axis”), confirmed coverage of claims against              
Fusion related to the data breach and provided a defense.                 
    On November 6, 2020, Zoll initiated this action against              
Barracuda in the District of Massachusetts.  Fusion moved to              
intervene as a Rule 20 party shortly thereafter and its motion            
was allowed in June, 2021.                                                
     Zoll, Ace, Fusion and Axis settled the claims at issue in            

their arbitration in November, 2021.  Pursuant to that                    
settlement, any claims that Zoll/Ace had against Barracuda in             
connection with the data breach were assigned to Axis and any             
claims that Fusion had were subrogated to Axis.  Axis, the                
remaining real party in interest in the case at bar, was                  
substituted as the plaintiff in April, 2022, at which time                
Fusion and Zoll were dismissed as parties.                                
     Several months later, Barracuda brought the pending motion           
for leave to file a third-party complaint against Fusion under            
Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a)(1).                                                 
II.   Motion for Leave to File a Third-Party Complaint                     
     A.  Legal Standard                                                   

     Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a)(1) provides that                               
     [a] defending party may, as third-party plaintiff,                   
     serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or                
     may be liable to it for all or part of the claim                     
     against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by                   
     motion, obtain the court's leave if it files the                     
     third-party complaint more than 14 days after serving                
     its original answer.                                                 
     The decision of whether to permit a defendant to file a              
third-party complaint more than 14 days after the original                
answer has been filed                                                     
    is left to the informed discretion of the district                   
    court, which should allow impleader on any colorable                 
    claim of derivative liability that will not unduly                   
    delay or otherwise prejudice the ongoing proceedings.                
Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio L.L.C., 166 F.3d 389, 393 (1st             
Cir. 1999).                                                               
    B.  Application                                                      
    Barracuda seeks leave of this Court to file a third-party            
complaint against Fusion.  In Count I of the proposed complaint,          
Barracuda asserts a claim for breach of contract based upon               
Fusion’s purported failure to include certain terms in contracts          
entered into with customers, including Zoll.  According to                
Barracuda, such terms were required by the OEM Agreement between          
Barracuda and Fusion.  In Count II of the proposed complaint,             
Barracuda asserts that it is entitled to indemnification from             
Fusion under the OEM Agreement for damages it may owe to Zoll.            
    Although Axis contends that the Court should refuse to               
allow Barracuda to file its proposed third-party complaint                
because it is not derivative of the claims pending in the case            
at bar, “a contractual right of indemnification” is a proper              
basis upon which a third-party plaintiff may bring a claim                
against a third-party defendant. See Zurich Am. Ins. v. Lord              
Elec. Co., 828 F. Supp. 2d 462, 468 (D.P.R. 2011) (citation               

omitted).  Barracuda alleges that such a right of                         
indemnification exists between itself and Fusion and therefore            
advocates that the proposed third-party complaint is                      
appropriate.                                                              
    Barracuda does not, however, satisfactorily address the              

issue of whether the filing of a third-party complaint would              
result in undue delay and prejudice.  The complicated                     
relationships and legal histories between Zoll, Fusion (and its           
predecessor), Barracuda (and its predecessor) and their various           
insurers have already contributed to a protracted course of               
litigation.  The underlying data breach occurred in November,             
2018, and Barracuda was served with Zoll’s initial arbitration            
demand in March, 2020.  The case at bar against Barracuda was             
filed in the District of Massachusetts in November, 2020.                 
    Barracuda’s dilatory effort to implead Fusion as a third-            
party defendant and to assert multiple contractual claims                 
against it would, if allowed, implicate complex, tangential               

questions of bankruptcy law with respect to Fusion’s January,             
2020, reorganization plan.  Such an allowance would also lead to          
further discovery, dispositive motions and legal contentions              
which would otherwise be outside the scope of this litigation.            
The Court will, therefore, deny Barracuda’s motion to file a              
third-party complaint against Fusion because of the undue delay           
and significant prejudice that it would cause.                            
                             ORDER                                       
    For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s motion for leave to           
file a third-party complaint (Docket No. 73) is DENIED.                   

So ordered.

Mass. Sept. 21, 2021).  In 2012, Fusion entered into a contract           

with Sonian to provide its customers (which later included Zoll)          
with software and related services for the management of                  
customer communications and email (“the OEM Agreement”).1  Fusion         
alleges that although Barracuda represented that its data                 
management capabilities would enable customers to identify and            
reduce risks it in fact lacked the “reasonable and readily                
available security protocols and products” to provide such                
security.                                                                 
    The data breach began on November 8, 2018, when a Barracuda          
employee allegedly left a data port open in its system during a           
standard migration of data within its network.  None of                   

Barracuda’s supervisory, security or oversight mechanisms                 
detected the error until approximately seven weeks later, on              
December 28, 2018.  In the meantime, the confidential and                 



1 The Court will refer to Sonian and Barracuda as “the Barracuda          
parties” except where Sonian’s individual corporate identity is           
relevant.                                                                 
protected health information of Zoll patients was apparently              
accessed by unauthorized third parties.                                   
    Barracuda finally contacted Fusion with respect to the data          
breach in January, 2019, advising that it                                 
    recently discovered that a very small number of user emails          
    stored in an application known as Sonian EA were                     
    compromised as a result of unauthorized access to our                
    system by a third party.                                             
Barracuda informed neither Fusion nor the Zoll plaintiffs that            
the data port had remained open and undetected for several weeks          
and, instead, allegedly misrepresented that the data breach was           
minor.                                                                    
    After receiving notice of the breach, Zoll began an                  
investigation into the event to determine whether customer PHI            
had been accessed.  As part of that investigation, it requested           
from Barracuda additional information regarding the data breach           
but Barracuda alleging refused to cooperate.  Thereafter, Zoll            
hired an independent forensics firm, Kroll, Inc., to assist in            
the investigation.                                                        
    In June, 2019, Fusion filed for bankruptcy protection under          
Chapter 11 of Title II of the United States Bankruptcy Code in            
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of           
New York.                                                                 
      B. Procedural History                                              
    The data breach has engendered substantial litigation                
between Fusion, Zoll, their respective insurers, the individuals          
whose PHI was compromised by the breach and the Barracuda                 
parties.  Those disputes are, in relevant part, described below.          
    In April, 2019, a class action lawsuit was filed against             

Zoll in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, by            
individuals claiming that their PHI had been the subject of the           
data breach.  That action was settled, and Zoll has assumed               
liability for any injury to its patients resulting from the data          
breach.                                                                   
         i.   The Arbitration                                            
    In August, 2019, Zoll filed a proof of claim in Fusion’s             
bankruptcy proceeding in the Southern District of New York                
seeking damages allegedly arising out of the data breach.                 
Fusion’s bankruptcy plan, which became effective in January,              
2020, contained language which provided that nothing in the plan          

would preclude Zoll from subsequently seeking damages from                
Fusion for harm suffered as a result of the data breach,                  
provided that such damages were “solely to the extent of                  
available insurance coverage and proceeds.”                               
    In March, 2020, Zoll initiated arbitration proceedings with          
Fusion, asserting claims for negligence and breach of contract.2          
Fusion’s insurer, Axis, confirmed coverage of claims related to           
the data breach and assumed defense. After Zoll’s insurer, Ace            
American Insurance Company (“Ace”) paid Zoll its claims for               
damages incurred due to the data breach, Ace was subrogated as            

the real party in interest in the arbitration.                            
    In November, 2021, Fusion, Axis, Zoll and Ace settled the            
arbitration claims.  Fusion and Zoll confirm that, pursuant to            
the settlement agreement, Zoll and Ace have assigned to Axis all          
claims that they have against Barracuda in connection with the            
data breach.  They contend that Axis is therefore the real party          
in interest with respect to the claims asserted by Fusion and             
Zoll against Barracuda in this action as set forth hereafter.             
        ii.   Claims of Zoll and Fusion against Barracuda                
    In November, 2020, Zoll filed the instant action against             
the Barracuda parties, alleging claims for 1) negligence (Count           

I), 2) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability (Count           
II), 3) breach of the implied warranty of fitness (Count III),            
4) breach of contract (Count IV) and 5) equitable                         
indemnification (Count V).  The Barracuda parties moved to                


2 Zoll also asserted claims against Barracuda before the                  
arbitrator dismissed it as a party in December, 2020, for lack            
of privity.                                                               
dismiss those claims and the Court allowed their motion except            
as to Count V.                                                            
     In June, 2021, Fusion intervened in the action and filed an          
eight-count complaint against the Barracuda parties, alleging             
claims for 1) breach of contract, 2) breach of the implied                
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, 3) negligent                     

misrepresentation, 4) tortious interference with contractual              
relations, 5) indemnification on the basis of a special                   
relationship, 6) indemnification on the basis of tortious                 
conduct, 7) breach of the implied warranty of merchantability             
and 8) breach of the implied warranty of fitness.  Shortly                
thereafter, the Barracuda parties filed the pending motion to             
dismiss Fusion’s intervenor complaint for failure to state a              
claim upon which relief can be granted.                                   
     In December, 2021, after the arbitration had concluded,              
Fusion and Zoll filed the pending motion to substitute Axis as            
plaintiff with respect to the original and intervenor                     

complaints.                                                               
II.   Barracuda’s Motion to Dismiss                                        
       A. Legal Standard                                                  
     To survive a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the              
subject pleading must contain sufficient factual matter to state          
a claim for relief that is actionable as a matter of law and              
“plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678             
(2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570             
(2007)).  A claim is facially plausible if, after accepting as            
true all non-conclusory factual allegations, the court can draw           
the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the             
misconduct alleged. Ocasio-Hernandez v. Fortuno-Burset, 640 F.3d          
1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011).                                                    

    When rendering that determination, a court may not look              
beyond the facts alleged in the complaint, documents                      
incorporated by reference therein and facts susceptible to                
judicial notice. Haley v. City of Boston, 657 F.3d 39, 46 (1st            
Cir. 2011).  A court also may not disregard properly pled                 
factual allegations even if actual proof of those facts is                
improbable. Ocasio-Hernandez, 640 F.3d at 12.  Rather, the                
relevant inquiry focuses on the reasonableness of the inference           
of liability that the plaintiff is asking the court to draw. Id.          
at 13.                                                                    
      B. Application                                                     

    The Barracuda parties have moved to dismiss Fusion’s eight-          
count intervenor complaint for failure to state a claim upon              
which relief can be granted.  The Court considers the counts of           
the complaint seriatim except with respect to Counts V and VI             
and Counts VII and VIII, which it treats together.                        
           i.  Breach of Contract (Count I)                              
    A claim for breach of contract under Massachusetts law               
requires the plaintiff to show that:                                      
    [1] there was an agreement between the parties; [2] the              
    agreement was supported by consideration; [3] the plaintiff          
    was ready, willing, and able to perform his or her part of           
    the contract; [4] the defendant committed a breach of the            
    contract; and [5] the plaintiff suffered harm as a result.           
Bulwer v. Mount Auburn Hosp., 46 N.E.3d 24, 39 (Mass. 2016).              
    Fusion contends that Barracuda breached the parties’                 
agreement by failing to provide the services required by the              
contract, i.e. data hosting that adequately protected the health          
information of Zoll’s patients.  Barracuda responds that Fusion           
cannot maintain its breach of contract claim because Fusion’s             
agreement with Zoll (“the Hosting Agreement”) did not comply              
with the condition precedent imposed by paragraph 4.1(b) of the           
agreement between Barracuda and Fusion (“the OEM Agreement”).             
    A condition precedent defines an event that must occur               
before a contract becomes effective or before an obligation to            
perform arises under the contract. Petricca Development Ltd.              
Partnership v. Pioneer Development Co., 40 F. Supp. 2d 49, 54             
(D. Mass. 1999).  If the condition precedent is not satisfied,            
the contract and the obligations set forth therein cannot be              
enforced. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. v. Town of               
Danvers, 577 N.E.2d 283, 288 (Mass. 1991).                                
    Paragraph 4.1(b) of the OEM Agreement requires that                  
Fusion’s contracts with its customers, such as Zoll, include              
    terms consistent with [the OEM Agreement] and contain[]              
    terms and conditions substantially in conformity with those          
    set forth on Exhibit B [of that agreement].                          
(stylization removed).                                                    
    Barracuda contends that Fusion failed to incorporate into            
the Hosting Agreement language 1) requiring Zoll to indemnify             
Apptix, Inc. (“Apptix”), i.e. Fusion, and Sonian, i.e.                    
Barracuda, for claims arising from Zoll’s use of the product,             
and 2) limiting the liability of Barracuda to the lesser of               
actual damages or $1,000.3  Barracuda argues that because the             
Hosting Agreement did not contain such language (or                       
substantially conforming language), Fusion has failed to satisfy          
the condition precedent and cannot bring the present breach of            
contract claim.                                                           
    Fusion rejoins that the Hosting Agreement satisfied the              
condition precedent imposed by paragraph 4.1(b) because, even             
though the Hosting Agreement did not contain verbatim                     

recitations of the terms and conditions at issue, it was                  
consistent with the OEM Agreement and contained terms and                 
conditions substantially in conformance with Exhibit B.                   


3 Apptix was later acquired by Fusion and the Court will refer to         
the two entities collectively as “Fusion” except insofar as the           
individual corporate identity of Apptix is relevant.                      
    Furthermore, Fusion submits that if the Hosting Agreement            
failed to satisfy the condition precedent, such a failure would           
have excused Barracuda’s performance under the OEM Agreement but          
would not constitute a waiver of Fusion’s breach of contract              
claims.  Rather, Fusion argues that because Barracuda continued           
to perform under the OEM Agreement, notwithstanding its                   

contractual right to obtain information about the terms and               
conditions of the Hosting Agreement, Barracuda waived its right           
to interpose the condition precedent to defeat Fusion’s breach            
of contract claims or, in the alternative, is equitably estopped          
from doing so.  Barracuda denies that either doctrine precludes           
its condition precedent defense.                                          
    The Hosting Agreement does not satisfy the condition                 
precedent imposed by paragraph 4.1(b) of the OEM Agreement.               
Exhibit B to the OEM Agreement contains a limitation of                   
liability provision capping the damages of Apptix and Sonian at           
“the lesser of actual damages . . . or one thousand dollars”.             

(capitalization removed).  The Hosting Agreement, however,                
limits the liability of a “party” to not more than                        
    the amount paid to Apptix under [the Hosting Agreement]              
    during the twelve (12) month period preceding the events             
    giving rise to such liability.                                       
Here, that limitation apparently amounts to slightly less than            
One Million Dollars.  Fusion argues that the Hosting Agreement            
is in substantial conformity with the OEM Agreement because               
liability thereunder is capped far below actual damages but that          
reality is insufficient where liability may nevertheless greatly          
exceed the limits imposed by the OEM Agreement.  Moreover, the            
limitation of liability provision in the Hosting Agreement                
extends to each “party”, a defined term which does not include            
Barracuda or Sonian.                                                      

    Nor is the indemnification provision of the same agreement           
in substantial conformity with Exhibit B to the OEM Agreement.            
Exhibit B’s indemnification provision designates Sonian as an             
intended third-party beneficiary of that provision.  By                   
contrast, the Hosting Agreement fails to impose an obligation on          
Zoll to indemnify Barracuda.                                              
    Despite the failure of the condition precedent, Fusion’s             
alternate argument of waiver is sufficient to preserve its                
breach of contract claim.                                                 
    Fusion contends that Barracuda’s failure to insist earlier           
on the satisfaction of the condition precedent constitutes                

waiver of the condition.  Generally, a party may waive its                
contract rights such as a condition precedent in its favor.               
Millen Industries, Inc. v. Flexco-Accessories Co., Inc., 5 F.             
Supp. 2d 72, 74 (D. Mass. 1998).  Waiver under Massachusetts law          
requires the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. Boston            
Helicopter Charter, Inc. v. Agusta Aviation Corp., 767 F. Supp.           
363, 372 (D. Mass. 1991).  It can be either express or inferred           
from the party’s conduct and the surrounding circumstances. Id.           
Where a waiver is implied, the waiving party’s conduct must be            
indicative of an intent to relinquish voluntarily a particular            
right such that no other reasonable explanation of the conduct            
is possible. Bachorz v. Miller-Forslund, 703 F.3d 27, 32 (1st             
Cir. 2012).                                                               

    Whether a waiver has occurred is usually a question of               
fact, Millen, 5 F. Supp. 2d at 74, but here Barracuda contends            
that non-waiver language in the OEM Agreement disposes of                 
Fusion’s waiver arguments as a matter of law.  The OEM Agreement          
provides that                                                             
    [n]o failure or delay of [Barracuda] in exercising any               
    right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a              
    waiver of such right or remedy.                                      
    Massachusetts case law on the efficacy of non-waiver                 
clauses is ambivalent.  Another session of this Court has                 
previously held such a clause effective, see Blue Hills Office            
Park LLC v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, 477 F. Supp. 2d 366, 374 (D.          
Mass. 2007) (holding that non-waiver provision barred waiver of           
mortgagor’s rights thereunder), while the Massachusetts Appeals           
Court has expressed skepticism, see M.J.G. Properties, Inc. v.            
Hurley, 537 N.E.2d 165, 167 (Mass. App. Ct. 1989) (stating that           
“we think the proper approach, and one which is in accord with            
our cases, is to look at the question of waiver as a question of          
fact in light of all the circumstances, including the existence           
of the antiwaiver clause”).  Because the Court finds the Hurley           
approach more consistent with Massachusetts law, it declines to           
discount Fusion’s waiver argument as a matter of law.  Fusion             
has alleged facts sufficient to support its waiver defense,               
specifically by contending that for nine years Barracuda did not          
once inquire about Fusion’s compliance with the condition                 

precedent.                                                                
          ii.  Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair         
              Dealing (Count II)                                         
    Under Massachusetts law, a covenant of good faith and fair           
dealing is implied in every contract. Shaulis v. Nordstrom,               
Inc., 120 F. Supp. 3d 40, 54 (D. Mass. 2015) (citing Uno Rests.           
v. Boston Kenmore Realty Corp., 805 N.E.2d 957, 964 (Mass.                
2004)).  The scope of the covenant is, however, limited and it            
may not be invoked to create rights or benefits not contemplated          
by the contract. Robert & Ardis James Found. v. Meyers, 48                
N.E.3d 450 (Mass. 2016).  Moreover, a breach of contract does             
not necessarily constitute a corresponding breach of the                  
covenant, Brand Group Int’l, LLC v. Established Brands Int’l,             
No. 10-11783, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81507 (D. Mass. July 26,              
2011).  Rather, the covenant provides that in the course of the           
performance of a contract neither party will do anything to               
injure or destroy the right of the other to receive the fruits            
thereof. Anthony’s Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., 583 N.E.3d             
806, 820 (Mass. 1991). A breach of the covenant thus occurs when          
one party violates the reasonable expectations of the other,              
Chokel v. Genzyme Corp., 867 N.E.2d 325, 329 (Mass. 2007).                
    In determining whether the covenant has been breached, the           
Court looks to whether there was a lack of good faith in the              
defendant’s performance. Weiler v. PortfolioScope, 12 N.E.3d              

354, 362 (Mass. 2014).  The burden of showing a lack of good              
faith rests with the plaintiff. Id.                                       
    Fusion argues that Barracuda breached the covenant of good           
faith and fair dealing by a) failing to inform it of the breach           
for more than one week after its discovery, b) initially                  
providing Fusion with explanations that understated the scope             
and severity of the breach and c) meaningfully failing to                 
cooperate with Fusion and Zoll’s attempts to investigate the              
breach.  Barracuda retorts that Fusion’s allegations sound                
merely in “human error” and lack the requisite absence of good            
faith to support a claim of breach of the implied covenant.               

That argument is unavailing for the purpose of the present                
motion.  While further discovery may bear out Barracuda’s                 
assertion that nothing more nefarious than human error was at             
play in the weeks after the discovery of the breach, Fusion has           
pled facts sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that good          
faith was lacking. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, A.L. Prime Energy          
Consultant, Inc. v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 95 N.E.3d            
547, 560 (Mass. 2018) (holding that lack of good faith can be             
inferred from totality of the circumstances).                             
         iii.  Negligent Misrepresentation (Count III)                   
    To maintain a claim of negligent misrepresentation,                  
plaintiffs must allege facts indicating that the defendants               
    (1) in the course of [their] business, (2) supplied false            
    information for the guidance of others (3) in their                  
    business transactions, (4) causing and resulting in                  
    pecuniary loss to those others (5) by their justifiable              
    reliance on the information, and that [defendants] (6)               
    failed to exercise reasonable care or competence in                  
    obtaining or communicating that information.                         
Braunstein v. McCabe, 571 F.3d 108, 126 (1st Cir. 2009).                  
Massachusetts courts treat negligent misrepresentation claims             
“more like negligence actions than deceit actions” and focus on           
the speaker’s degree of care in making the statement. Cummings            
v. HPG Intern., Inc., 244 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).  The               
speaker need not have known that the statement was false if the           
truth could have been ascertained through “a modicum of                   
diligence”. Zimmerman v. Kent, 575 N.E.2d 70, 74 (Mass. App. Ct.          
1991).                                                                    
    Fusion has failed to state a claim for negligent                     
misrepresentation.  While it alleges that Barracuda made false            
statements regarding the data breach, it fails to allege that             
the harm it suffered was due to those allegedly false statements          
rather than the data breach itself.                                       
          iv.  Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations          
              (Count IV)                                                 
    To maintain a claim for tortious interference with a                 
contract or business relationship, the plaintiff must allege              
that                                                                      
    1) he had a contract with a third party, 2) the defendant            
    knowingly induced the third party to break that contract,            
    3) the interference, in addition to being intentional, was           
    improper in motive or means and 4) the plaintiff was harmed          
    by the defendant’s actions.                                          
Psy-Ed Corp. v. Klein, 947 N.E.2d 520, 536 (Mass. 2011).                  
    Fusion’s claim of tortious interference is incompatible              
with the facts it has alleged.  As with its claim for negligent           
misrepresentation, Fusion has failed to allege that it suffered           
any harm from Barracuda’s post-breach actions distinct from the           
harm occasioned by the data breach.  Moreover, to the extent              
Fusion alleges that the data breach constituted tortious                  
interference with contractual relations, it has not alleged that          
Barracuda acted with the requisite impropriety in its motive or           
means. See King v. Driscoll, 638 N.E.2d 488, 495 (Mass. 1994)             
(explaining that “improper motive or means” prong requires that           
defendant possess “actual malice, a spiteful malignant purpose,           
unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest”).  Consequently,          
Fusion has not stated a claim for tortious interference with              
contractual relations.                                                    
           v.  Indemnification (Counts V and VI)                         
    Under Massachusetts law, a right to indemnification may              
arise under three theories, namely 1) an express agreement, 2) a          
contractual right implied from the nature of the relationship             

between the parties and 3) a common law tort-based right. Araujo          
v. Woods Hole, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket Steamship Auth., 693          
F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1982).  Fusion alleges it is entitled to              
indemnification by Barracuda under the second and third                   
theories.                                                                 
    Implied contractual indemnification exists when there are            
“special factors” surrounding a contractual relationship which            
indicate an intention by one party to indemnify another. Fall             
River Housing Auth. v. H.V. Collins Co., 604 N.E.2d 1310, 1313            
(Mass. 1992).  Fusion contends that the OEM Agreement created a           
“special relationship” entitling it to implied contractual                

indemnification.  Barracuda rejoins that the OEM Agreement                
provided only for indemnification of Barracuda by Fusion and              
that Fusion has no implied indemnification in its favor that the          
parties declined to include expressly.                                    
    The Court agrees with Barracuda.  The parties’ relationship          
does not indicate an intention of Barracuda to indemnify Fusion.          
Rather, the OEM Agreement exclusively provides for the                    
indemnification of Barracuda.  Under such circumstances, there            
is no implied right to indemnity on the part of Fusion. See id.           
(finding no implied right to indemnification where express                
indemnity provision existed and limited indemnification only to           
the costs arising from its negligence).                                   
    Common law tort-based equitable indemnification is                   

available to a party who did not join in the negligent act of             
another but, because of that act, was nevertheless exposed to             
liability. Hernandez v. City of Boston, 277 F. Supp. 3d 176, 180          
(D. Mass. 2017).  That standard typically requires that the               
party seeking indemnity be, at most, passively or vicariously at          
fault. Araujo, 693 F.2d at 3.  Where the party seeking                    
indemnification instead was itself responsible for acts or                
omissions proximately causing plaintiff's injury, courts have             
found tort-based equitable indemnification to be inappropriate.           
Id.                                                                       
    Fusion fails to state a claim for tort-based equitable               

indemnification because it does not allege that it has been held          
liable as a tortfeasor, or will be.  Rather, its potential                
liability appears to derive from its contractual relationship             
with Zoll.  Under such circumstances tort-based equitable                 
indemnity is inappropriate. See Walter v. Shuffain, P.C. v. CPA           
Mut. Ins. Co., No. 06-10163, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25422 (D.              
Mass. Mar. 28, 2008) (explaining that liability “must spring              
from the same theory, not merely the same harms”), see also               
Stewart v. Roy Bros., 265 N.E.2d 357 (Mass. 1970).                        
          vi.  Breach of Implied Warranties of Merchantability           
              (Count VII) and Fitness (Count VIII)                       
    In its prior memorandum and order (“M&O”) allowing, in               
part, and denying, in part, Barracuda’s motion to dismiss                 
plaintiff Zoll’s claims, the Court held that the Barracuda                
parties validly waived the implied warranties of merchantability          
and fitness in the OEM Agreement and that Zoll thus could not             
maintain its claims for breach of warranty. See Zoll Med. Corp.,          
2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180761 at *10-14.  Zoll was a third party           
to the OEM Agreement and as such its implied warranty claims              
were derivative of those of Fusion, the principal.  See id.               

(citing Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 729 N.E.2d               
1113, 1118 (Mass. 2000) (holding that subsequent purchaser                
cannot possess greater warranty rights than original purchaser).          
In finding that Barracuda had waived the implied warranties as            
to Zoll, the Court concluded that Barracuda had made the same             
waiver as to Fusion. See id. at 14.  That holding controls here           
and thus for the reasons stated in the Court’s prior M&O, Fusion          
has failed to state a claim for breach of the implied warranties          
of merchantability and fitness.                                           
III.   The Motion to Substitute                                             
      Zoll and Fusion have moved to substitute Axis as plaintiff.          
 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(c) provides that if an                 
 interest in the litigation is transferred after its                       
 commencement, the action                                                  
      may be continued by . . . the original party unless the              
      court, on motion, orders the transferee to be substituted            
      in the action or joined with the original party.                     
 Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(c).                                                    
      The court has “considerable leeway” to allow the                     
 substitution of parties so as to “facilitate the conduct of the           
 litigation.” Potvin v. Speedway, LLC, 891 F.3d 410, 416 (1st              
 Cir. 2010) (internal citations omitted), see Negron-Almeda v.             
 Santiago, 579 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir. 2009) (describing Rule 25 as          
 a “discretional procedural vehicle”).                                     
      Where an insurer has compensated its insured for a loss in           
 full, the insurer is the sole real party in interest and must             
 sue in its own name. See Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst. v. ATS            
 Specialized, No. 17-12301, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 250077 at *9-10          

 (D. Mass. Dec. 22, 2020) (collecting cases).  If the insured has          
 been compensated only in part, however, both it and the insurer           
 are real parties in interest. See id.  Where an interest has              
 been otherwise assigned, Rule 25(c) allows for substitution of            
 the assignee. See Citibank v. Grupo Cupey, Inc., 382 F.3d 29,             
 30-31 (1st Cir. 2004).                                                    
    Fusion and Zoll represent that, pursuant to the November,            
2021, settlement of the arbitration proceeding, they, along with          
Axis and Zoll’s insurer, Ace, agreed to assign to Axis “all               
claims that Zoll and/or Ace may have against Barracuda in                 
connection with [the breach]”.  They consequently seek                    
substitution under Rule 25.  Barracuda opposes substitution on            

the ground that the settlement agreement has not been produced            
and its legal effect is therefore uncertain.                              
    The Court is disinclined to declare the legal effect of              
documents it has not seen. See Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst. v.          
ATS Specialized, Inc., No. 17-12301, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS                
250077 at *5-10 (D. Mass. Dec. 22, 2020) (determining party-in-           
interest status for Rule 17 purposes after examination of                 
operative documents).  The Court will, therefore, in order to             
“facilitate the conduct of the litigation”, allow the joinder of          
Axis (which apparently possesses an interest of some kind in              
this litigation) as plaintiff and intervenor but will not                 

dismiss Zoll and Fusion until it is shown that they retain no             
continuing interest in the action. Potvin, 891 F.3d at 416.               
                             ORDER                                       
    For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motions to dismiss            
(Docket No. 31) is, with respect to Counts III, IV, V, VI, VII            
and VIII, ALLOWED, but otherwise, DENIED.                                 
    The joint motion of Zoll Services LLC, Zoll Medical                  
Corporation and Fusion LLC to substitute Axis Insurance Company

seeks to introduce Axis Insurance Company into the action as              
plaintiff, ALLOWED, but otherwise, DENIED.                                
So ordered.

GORTON, J.                                                                
    This action arises out of a data breach which compromised            
the confidential, protected health information (“PHI”) of more            
than 277,000 patients of Zoll Services LLC (“Zoll Services”), an          
indirect subsidiary of Zoll Medical Corporation (“Zoll Medical”)          
(together, “Zoll” or “plaintiffs”).  Pending before the Court is          
the motion of defendants Barracuda Networks, Inc. (“Barracuda”)           
and Sonian Inc. (“Sonian”) (together, “defendants”) to dismiss            
the complaint filed by plaintiffs.  For the reasons that follow,          
that motion will be allowed in part and denied in part.                   
I.   Background                                                           
    Zoll Medical is a Massachusetts-based corporation that               
develops and markets medical devices and software solutions that          
help advance emergency health care.  It is the indirect parent            
corporation of Zoll Services, a Nevada-based limited liability            
company that commercializes the “LifeVest wearable cardioverter           
defibrillator”.                                                           
    In the course of commercializing that product, Zoll                  
Services often receives emails from physicians containing                 
patient information, such as patient names, addresses,                    

demographics and health information.  In order to manage and              
secure that data, plaintiffs rely upon a limited number of                
third-party service providers.  To that end, in 2012 Zoll                 
Medical entered into a Hosting Services Agreement (the “Hosting           
Agreement”) with Apptix, Inc. (“Apptix”) whereby Apptix agreed            
to provide plaintiffs with a product that would safely store              
their emails and other data.  Apptix has since been acquired by           
Fusion, LLC (“Fusion”), a New Jersey limited liability company            
with its principal place of business in Georgia.                          
    Separately, in 2014, Zoll Lifecor Corporation, the                   
predecessor to Zoll Services, entered into a Business Associate           

Agreement (“the BAA”) with Apptix pursuant to the Health                  
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) wherein            
Apptix allegedly agreed, inter alia, to use appropriate                   
safeguards to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI           
and to ensure that any of its subcontractors or vendors to whom           
it provides PHI agreed to do the same.                                    
    In the course of performing its obligations under the                
Hosting Agreement and the BAA, Apptix entered into a contract             
with Sonian to provide its customers with software and related            
services for the management of customer communications and email          
(“the OEM Agreement”).  Sonian is a Delaware corporation that             
has since been acquired by Barracuda, another Delaware                    

corporation with its principal place of business in California.           
Plaintiffs allege that Barracuda holds itself out to the public           
as “an expert in data security”, namely, in archiving emails in           
a secure environment with controls that ensure that only                  
authorized personnel have access to the data stored within the            
archive.  Despite that representation, plaintiffs and Fusion              
contend that, with respect to their data, Barracuda failed to             
implement adequate safeguards which ultimately led to the                 
subject data breach.                                                      
    The data breach began on November 8, 2018, when a Barracuda          
employee allegedly left a data port open in its system during a           

standard migration of data within its network.  None of                   
Barracuda’s supervisory, security or oversight mechanisms                 
detected the error until approximately seven weeks later, on              
December 28, 2018.  In the meantime, the confidential and                 
protected health information of plaintiffs’ patients was                  
apparently accessed by unauthorized third parties.                        
    Barracuda finally contacted Apptix with respect to the data          
breach in January, 2019, advising that it                                 
    recently discovered that a very small number of user emails          
    stored in an application known as Sonian EA were                     
    compromised as a result of unauthorized access to our                
    system by a third party.                                             

Barracuda informed neither Apptix nor the Zoll plaintiffs that            
the data port had remained open, undetected for several weeks             
and, instead, allegedly misrepresented that the data breach was           
minor.                                                                    
    Once Zoll Medical received notification of the breach, it            
and its subsidiaries began an investigation into the event to             
determine whether customer PHI had been accessed.  As part of             
that investigation, plaintiffs requested from Barracuda                   
additional information regarding the data breach but Barracuda            
purportedly refused to cooperate, compelling plaintiffs to hire           
an independent forensics firm, Kroll, Inc., to assist in the              
investigation.                                                            
    Thereafter, plaintiffs issued a press release advising the           
public that its data had been breached, including communications          
which contained PHI.  In April, 2019, a class action lawsuit was          
filed against Zoll Medical and Zoll Services in the Circuit               
Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia by individuals claiming            
that their PHI had been the subject of the data breach.  That             
action has since been settled, leaving Zoll Services liable to            
its patients for any injury resulting from the “data breach               
event”.  Plaintiffs contend that they have also suffered                  
investigation, mitigation and remediation costs associated with           
the incident, as well as harm to their reputation.                        
     In November, 2020, plaintiffs filed the instant action               
against Barracuda and Sonian, alleging (1) negligence (Count I);          

(2) breach of implied warranty of merchantability (Count II);             
(3) breach of implied warranty of fitness (Count III); (4)                
breach of written contract—third party beneficiary (Count IV)             
and (5) equitable indemnity (Count V).                                    
     Defendants now move to dismiss the complaint for failure to          
state a claim.                                                            
II.   Motions to Dismiss                                                   
       A. Legal Standard                                                  
     To survive a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the              
subject pleading must contain sufficient factual matter to state          
a claim for relief that is actionable as a matter of law and              

“plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678             
(2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570             
(2007)).  A claim is facially plausible if, after accepting as            
true all non-conclusory factual allegations, the court can draw           
the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the             
misconduct alleged. Ocasio-Hernandez v. Fortuno-Burset, 640 F.3d          
1, 12 (1st Cir. 2011).                                                    
    When rendering that determination, a court may not look              
beyond the facts alleged in the complaint, documents                      
incorporated by reference therein and facts susceptible to                
judicial notice. Haley v. City of Boston, 657 F.3d 39, 46 (1st            
Cir. 2011).  A court also may not disregard properly pled                 
factual allegations even if actual proof of those facts is                

improbable.  Ocasio-Hernandez, 640 F.3d at 12.  Rather, the               
relevant inquiry focuses on the reasonableness of the inference           
of liability that the plaintiff is asking the court to draw.              
Id. at 13.                                                                
      B. Application                                                     
           i.  Negligence                                                
    A plaintiff asserting a negligence claim must establish the          
basic elements of duty, breach, causation and damages.  See               
Colter v. Barber-Greene Co., 525 N.E.2d 1305, 1313 (Mass. 1988).          
To state a claim for negligence, a plaintiff typically must               
allege damages beyond pure economic loss, as “purely economic             

losses are unrecoverable . . . in the absence of personal injury          
or property damage”.  FMR Corp. v. Boston Edison Co., 613 N.E.2d          
902, 903 (Mass. 1993).  This limitation on the recovery of                
purely pecuniary harm is known as the economic loss doctrine.             
    Here, defendants contend that the economic loss doctrine             
bars plaintiffs’ claim for negligence.  Plaintiffs, on the other          
hand, maintain that their negligence claim falls within an                
exception to the economic loss doctrine.  They argue that the             
economic loss doctrine does not preclude recovery of purely               
economic loss on a negligence claim arising out of an                     
independent, noncontractual legal duty.  In particular,                   
plaintiffs claim that the duty of Barracuda to keep Zoll’s                
confidential customer information secure from unauthorized                

access arises from HIPAA and common law privacy principles                
separate from any agreement between the parties.  In the                  
alternative, plaintiffs submit that they reasonably and                   
foreseeably relied on defendants’ promise to Fusion that it               
would keep the PHI of Zoll’s customers secure, and that                   
Massachusetts law recognizes reasonable reliance on a                     
defendant’s promise to a third party as an exception to the               
economic loss doctrine.                                                   
    With respect to the alleged common law duty to maintain              
privacy, plaintiffs cite Portier v. NEO Tech. Solutions, No. 17-          
cv-30111, 2019 WL 7946103 (D. Mass. Dec. 31, 2019).  In Portier,          

the district court held that because defendant employer                   
    undertook the affirmative acts of collecting and storing             
    [plaintiff] employees’ personal and financial information            
    on its internet accessible computer system, it had a common          
    law duty to exercise reasonable care to protect the data             
    from the foreseeable risk of a data breach.                          

Id. at *20.  The district court concluded that plaintiff                  
employees could recover purely pecuniary losses notwithstanding           
the economic loss doctrine.  Id.                                          
    Plaintiffs’ reliance on Portier is misplaced.  In that               
case, the district court concluded that a “special relationship”          
existed between plaintiff employees and defendant employer, and           
that the special relationship gave rise to a duty on the                  
employer’s part to safeguard personally identifiable information          
provided to it by the employees.  Id. at *21.  Unlike the                 

Portier plaintiffs, plaintiffs here cannot identify a similar             
relationship with defendant.                                              
    Moreover, an exception to the economic loss doctrine would           
be inappropriate in this case.  While in Portier the transfer of          
private information was at most incidental to the object of the           
employment relationship, here the storage and protection of               
sensitive data was exactly what the parties contracted among              
themselves to do.  See Wyman v. Ayer Properties, LLC, 11 N.E.3d           
1074, 1080 (Mass. 2014) (explaining that the economic loss rule           
was “developed in part to prevent the progression of tort                 
concepts from undermining contract expectations”), see also 74            

Am. Jur. 2d Torts § 23 (stating that the purpose of the economic          
loss doctrine is to “maintain the distinction or boundary                 
between contract law and tort law”).                                      
    Plaintiffs’ attempts to locate an independent legal duty in          
Barracuda’s ostensible HIPAA obligations are equally unavailing.          
Plaintiffs have neither furnished any authority in support of             
their position that HIPAA creates a tort duty nor specified from          
which provisions the ostensible duty arises.  Although the Court          
is not aware of any case addressing the issue of whether HIPAA            
creates a duty under tort law, the Court finds it instructive             
that federal courts have declined to recognize the existence of           
a private statutory right of action under the statute.  See               
Miller v. Nichols, 586 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2009), see also Acara            

v. Banks, 470 F.3d 569, 571-72 (5th Cir. 2006), Sneed v. Pan              
American Hosp., 370 Fed. App’x 47, 50 (11th Cir. 2010).                   
    Finally, plaintiffs have not alleged actual reliance on any          
promise made by defendants to Fusion.  The reliance exception to          
the economic loss doctrine “applies only where the plaintiff              
reasonably and foreseeably relied on the defendant's promise to           
someone other than the plaintiff.”  Cumis Ins. Soc’y, Inc. v.             
BJ’s Wholesale Club, 2008 WL 2345865, aff’d, 918 N.E.2d 36                
(Mass. 2009).  Here, plaintiffs have not alleged that they                
reasonably relied upon, or even were aware of, the agreement              
between Barracuda and Fusion.  Consequently, plaintiffs cannot            

employ the reliance exception to circumvent the economic loss             
doctrine.                                                                 
          ii.  Breach of Implied Warranties of Merchantability           
              and Fitness                                                
    Massachusetts law provides that manufacturers impliedly              
warrant to customers that their products will be merchantable             
and “fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are               
used”.  Back v. Wickes Corp., 378 N.E.2d 964, 969 (Mass. 1978)            
(quoting M.G.L. c. 106, § 2-314(2)(C)).  To succeed on a claim            
for breach of implied warranty of merchantability, a plaintiff            
must show that 1) defendant manufactured or sold the subject              
product, 2) that product contained a defect or unreasonably               
dangerous condition rendering it unsuitable for its ordinary              

use, 3) plaintiff was using the product in a manner that                  
defendant intended or reasonably could have foreseen and 4) the           
defect or dangerous condition was a legal cause of plaintiff’s            
injury.  Lally v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 698 N.E.2d 28,           
43 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998).  Massachusetts law also provides for            
an implied warranty of fitness with respect to goods used for a           
particular purpose.  M.G.L. c. 106, § 2-315.  That warranty               
    is similar to the warranty of merchantability but applies            
    only where the seller at the time of contracting has reason          
    to know any particular purpose for which the goods are               
    required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's               
    skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods.               

Taupier v. Davol, 400 F. Supp. 3d 430 (D. Mass. 2020) (internal           
citations omitted).                                                       
    In contrast, the implied warranties of merchantability and           
fitness do not apply to contracts for the rendition of services.          
White v. Peabody Constr. Co., Inc., 434 N.E.2d 1015, 1022 (Mass.          
1982) (holding that claim for breach of implied warranties could          
not be brought because contract was not for sale of goods), see           
also Mattoon v. City of Pittsfield, 775 N.E.2d 770, 783-84                
(Mass. App. Ct. 2002) (holding that because provision of                  
services was “predominant factor” in contract for municipal               
water distribution the implied warranties of fitness and                  
merchantability did not apply).                                           
    Here, plaintiffs allege that defendants breached the                 
implied warranties of fitness and merchantability with respect            

to Sonian’s email archive and data import/export technology               
licensed to Apptix under the OEM Agreement.  They do so                   
notwithstanding their contention that the OEM Agreement is a              
contract for services.  Defendants maintain that the implied              
warranties were waived and, if the contract was for services,             
they do not apply as a matter of law.                                     
    The Court need not address the question of whether the OEM           
Agreement is a contract for goods or for services because the             
OEM Agreement waives the implied warranties of fitness and                
merchantability.  A valid waiver of the warranty of                       
merchantability “must mention merchantability and in the case of          

a writing be conspicuous”, and a valid waiver of the warranty of          
fitness must be written and conspicuous.  M.G.L. c. 106, § 2-             
316(2).  A provision is conspicuous if a reasonable person                
against whom it is to operate would have noticed it.  See M.G.L.          
c. 106, § 1-201(10).  Whether a term is conspicuous is for the            
Court to decide.  Id.  In making that determination, the Court            
takes into account                                                        
    the location of the clause, the size of the type, any                
    special highlighting, such as boldface, capitalization or            
    underlining, the clarity of the clause, and the                      
    sophistication of the contracting parties.                           

Logan Equipment Corp. v. Simon Aerials, Inc. 736 F.Supp. 1188,            
1197 (D. Mass. 1990).                                                     
    Here, the OEM Agreement expressly and conspicuously limits           
the warranty protections available for programs and services              
that defendants agreed to provide under the Agreement.  In                
particular, Section 11 of the Agreement provides in relevant              
part that                                                                 
    11.1 Sonian agrees to provide the Services to [Apptix] in            
    accordance with the Service Level Agreement attached hereto          
    . . .                                                                
    11.2 Except for the warranties provided in Section 11.1,             
    OEM acknowledges and agrees that Sonian disclaims all other          
    warranties whether express, implied or statutory, with               
    respect to the Services, and specifically disclaims the              
    implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a                 
    particular purpose, noninfringement or any warranties                
    arising from that course of dealing, usage or trade                  
    practice.  Sonian does not warrant that the services shall           
    be uninterrupted or error free.                                      

(capitalization removed and emphasis added).  The “Services”              
include one-time imports of email.                                        
    A reasonable person entering into the OEM Agreement would            
have understood that special attention was to be paid to Section          
11.2.  The text of Section 11.2 is entirely capitalized, one of           
only two sections of the OEM Agreement to receive such emphasis.          
Further, it is located in the body of the agreement and its               
language and meaning are clear.  Finally, the OEM Agreement was           
drafted by sophisticated parties.                                         
    Thus, because the waivers of the implied warranties of               
merchantability and fitness are conspicuous, in writing, and              
make mention of “merchantability”, they are valid and the                 
warranties are waived.                                                    

    Finally, plaintiffs’ awareness or lack thereof of the                
waiver provisions in the OEM Agreement is immaterial.  The                
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has held that a subsequent           
purchaser cannot possess greater warranty rights as to the                
seller than the original purchaser.  Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack           
Trucks, Inc. 729 N.E.2d 1113, 1118 (Mass. 2000).  Theos controls          
the present case.  Defendants’ disclaimer of the implied                  
warranties as to Apptix renders them waived as to plaintiffs.             
         iii.  Breach of Written Contract—Third Party                    
              Beneficiary                                                
    Under Massachusetts law, only intended beneficiaries may             

enforce a contract.  See Miller v. Mooney, 725 N.E.2d 545, 549–           
50 (2000).  Massachusetts courts apply the Restatement (Second)           
of Contracts (1981) test to determine whether a third party is            
an intended beneficiary of a promise.  Id.  That test provides            
that                                                                      
    (1) Unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee,           
    a beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if             
    recognition of a right to perform in the beneficiary is              
    appropriate to effectuate the intention of the parties and           
    either (a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an            
    obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary;          
    or (b) the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends          
    to give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised                  
    performance.                                                         

Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 302 (1981).  To ascertain             
the intention of the parties, courts “look at the language and            
circumstances of the contract”.  Anderson v. Fox Hill Village             
Homeowners Corp., 676 N.E.2d 821, 822 (Mass. 1997).  A contract           
does not confer third-party beneficiary status upon a nonparty            
unless its language and circumstances show that the parties               
“clearly and definitely” intended it to benefit that party.               
Cumis Ins. Soc’y, Inc. v. BJ’s Wholesale Club, Inc., 918 N.E.2d           
36, 44 (Mass. 2009)(internal punctuation omitted) (citing                 
Anderson, 676 N.E.2d at 822).                                             
    Here, the terms of the OEM Agreement between defendants and          
Apptix make clear that the Zoll plaintiffs were not intended              
third-party beneficiaries of the agreement.  Indeed, the intent           
of the OEM Agreement, as described in the provisions limiting             
the rights and duties thereunder to Apptix, its successors, and           
assigns and requiring Fusion to enter into separate, subsequent           
agreements with downstream customers is clear.  The intent was            
for Barracuda to provide Apptix with a product to market and              
license as its own, thereby rendering Apptix, now Fusion,                 
responsible for the relationship between Apptix and downstream            
customers, i.e. the Zoll plaintiffs.  Thus, because the OEM               
Agreement does not “clearly and definitely” demonstrate an                
intent to benefit Zoll, Zoll is not a third-party beneficiary of          
the contract.                                                             
          iv.  Equitable Indemnity                                       
    Under Massachusetts law, a right to indemnification may              

arise under three circumstances, namely, 1) an express                    
agreement, 2) a contractual right implied from the nature of the          
relationship between the parties and 3) a common law tort-based           
right.  See Araujo v. Woods Hole, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket            
Steamship Auth., 693 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1982).                           
    Plaintiffs allege that the third circumstance of common law          
tort-based equitable indemnification, applies here.  Tort-based           
equitable indemnification is available to a party who “did not            
join in the negligent act of another but was exposed to                   
liability because of that negligent act.”  Hernandez v. City of           
Boston, 277 F.Supp.3d 176, 180 (D. Mass. 2017) (quoting Rathbun           

v. Western Mass. Elec. Co., 479 N.E.2d 1383, 1385 (Mass. 1985)).          
It has usually been available only where the party seeking                
indemnity was passively or vicariously at fault.  Araujo, 693             
F.3d at 3.  Where the party seeking indemnification was itself            
responsible for acts or omissions proximately causing                     
plaintiff's injury, courts have found tort-based equitable                
indemnification to be inappropriate.  Id.                                 
    Here, Zoll has sufficiently pled a claim for equitable               
indemnity from Barracuda.  Zoll has alleged that it is liable             
for damages as a result of the West Virginia class action, that           
the damages were the result of Barracuda’s negligence and that            
any fault by Zoll was passive or vicarious in nature.                     
    Barracuda’s response that Zoll is not without fault itself           

misses the mark.  With respect to a motion to dismiss, the Court          
accepts as true all well-pled facts set forth in the complaint            
and draws all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the             
pleading party.  Haley, 657 F.3d at 46.  Whether Zoll was                 
negligent itself is not an issue suitable for resolution at this          
juncture.                                                                 
                             ORDER                                       
    For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion to dismiss             
(Docket No. 18) is ALLOWED, in part, DENIED, in part.  Counts I,          
II, III and IV of the complaint are hereby DISMISSED but Count V          
for equitable indemnity is not.                                           

    Plaintiff Zoll’s request to amend its complaint is DENIED.           
So ordered.
