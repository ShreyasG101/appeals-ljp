outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== 3M Company''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. 3M argued that the case was removable under the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), because the lawsuit ''relates to'' MilSpec AFFF that 3M manufactured at the direction of the U.S. military, as the alleged PFAS contamination of natural resources in this ''state-wide contamination case'' would encompass and overlap with claims to recover for PFAS contamination caused at least in part by MilSpec AFFF.

  2. 3M contended that it was entitled to a federal forum in which it could raise the production of MilSpec AFFF as a defense or alternative theory of causation.

  3. 3M argued that its removal was timely under 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(3) because no plaintiff''s paper predating March 30, 2022, made clear that a court would need to engage in factfinding regarding commingling of MilSpec AFFF PFAS and non-AFFF PFAS, and thus did not alert it to the case''s removability.

  4. 3M asserted that the district court erred in concluding that the removal was untimely, disputing that any prior documents or disclosures in the record triggered the thirty-day removal clock.'
