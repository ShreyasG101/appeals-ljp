outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== William Scales''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in finding that he failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

  2. Appellant contended that his complaint and several letters plausibly alleged a ''hybrid claim'' for breach of a collective bargaining agreement against the Hotel and breach of the duty of fair representation against the Union.

  3. Appellant asserted that the facts alleged in his filings raised two additional claims that the district court failed to consider: a claim for breach of the collective bargaining agreement against the Union and a claim for conversion.

  4. Appellant argued that the district court abused its discretion in failing to appoint him pro bono counsel.'
