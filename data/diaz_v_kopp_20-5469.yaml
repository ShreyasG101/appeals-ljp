reason_for_appeal: '=== Angel Diaz''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in concluding that his claim, which sought release from custody based on alleged unconstitutional conditions of confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was not cognizable under habeas corpus and instead had to be brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

  2. Appellant contended that his petition properly alleged Eighth Amendment violations that could only be remedied by his release from all available state facilities, and therefore fell within the core of habeas corpus jurisdiction.'
