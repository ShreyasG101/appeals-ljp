outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Richard Joseph Legenza''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Legenza argued that Del Rosario had complete and accurate information concerning the status of his business affairs, activities, and finances.

  2. Legenza contended that the District Court improperly rejected his justification for the loss of records and the authority of a 2001 decision by a bankruptcy court (In re Brenes) to assess justification.

  3. Legenza argued that summary judgment was not appropriate in the determination of his justification based on the rules governing summary judgment and the statutory standard of ''all the circumstances of the case.''

  4. Legenza further argued that the expenses involved in his marketing and sales of Wild Aces were reasonably reproducible based on his recollection of his activities.'
