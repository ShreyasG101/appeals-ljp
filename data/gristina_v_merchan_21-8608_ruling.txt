UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 

ANNA GRISTINA, 
                        Plaintiff,                   21-CV-8608 (PAC) 
            ~against- 
                                                  OPINION & ORDER 
NEW YORK STATE JUDGE JUAN MERCHAN, 
in an official capacity, and NEW YORK COUNTY 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY ALVIN BRAGG,! in an 
official capacity, 
                        Defendants. 

     Plaintiff Anna Gristina seeks two sealed transcripts related to her prosecution and guilty    □ 

plea in New York state court.  To do so, she brought this action against the state court judge who 
sealed those transcripts, as well as the District Attorney who opposed her motion to unseal.  Both 
Defendants have moved to dismiss. 
     Whatever the merits of Gristina’s claim, the Court lacks the power to grant her the relief 
she seeks.  Because Gristina has already sought identical unsealing relief in the state appellate 
court, and because that relief implicates an order that uniquely furthers the state court’s judicial 
function, this Court must abstain from jurisdiction under the Younger doctrine.  The Court also 
abstains under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, because Gristina invites this Court to overturn the 
state trial court’s decision.  The Court therefore GRANTS the motions and DISMISSES this case 
without prejudice. 

! This action was filed initially against Alvin Bragg’s predecessor in office, District Attorney Cyrus 
Vance.  By operation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), when a public official named in . 
his official capacity no longer holds an office, his “successor is automatically substituted as a 
party.”  The Clerk of Court is directed to amend the caption to reflect this change.

                               BACKGROUND 
     The following  factual  allegations  are taken from the Complaint,  ECF No.  1,  as  well 
documents attached to the Complaint and court filings of which judicial notice can be taken.  See 
Gamm v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., 944 F.3d 455, 462 (2d Cir. 2019).  The Court assumes these 
allegations are true for purposes of these motions to dismiss.  See id. 
     Plaintiff Anna Gristina, known as the “Soccer Mom Madam,” was the subject of tabloid 
coverage for allegedly operating a high-end brothel out of a Manhattan apartment.  See Complaint 
at A030-31.  She pled guilty in 2012 to promoting prostitution in New York state court.  The trial 
judge in the case, Justice Juan Merchan, sentenced Gristina to six months imprisonment and five 
years of probation.  Id. { 11. 
      Gristina now alleges her guilty plea was coerced and seeks to vacate her conviction.  Jd. 
{ 13.  Before she can do so, however, Gristina contends she needs transcripts from two days of 
trial  court proceedings:  August  13  and  16,  2012.   Jd.   16.   She  originally  requested  those 
transcripts from the state court reporters but only received portions of each transcript,  as the 
remainder had been sealed.  Id. { 22. 
      Gristina then went to Justice Merchan in the trial court.  She filed a motion to unseal the 
remainder of the transcripts, which the New York County District Attorney opposed.  Id. {J 22, 
23.  Justice Merchan, in a written decision, denied the request to unseal the transcripts under his 
discretionary authority.  Jd. at   25; see generally id. at AO02—07 (the “Trial Court Decision”).        

Regarding the August 13 transcript, Justice Merchan noted Gristina had not been present, as the 
matter involved Gristina’s co-defendant only.  See Trial Court Decision at A004,  Regarding the

August 16 transcript, Justice Merchan noted it involved an ex parte matter by the District Attorney. 
See id.  Neither transcript,” therefore, involved Gristina or her guilty plea.? 
     Gristina then went to the Appellate Division, First Department.  She filed a mandamus 
petition under Article 78 of New York’s Civil Practice Law and Rules seeking to compel Justice 
Merchan to unseal the transcripts.  Id. at { 27; see also generally Declaration of Patricia J. Bailey, 
Ex.  1, ECF No. 27-1  (the “Article 78 Petition”).  The First Department dismissed her petition 
without elaboration.  See Complaint at A001.  At the time she filed her Complaint in this case, 
Gristina “intend[ed] to appeal” that dismissal to the New York Court of Appeals.  See id.  J 28. 
However, her motion for leave to appeal has subsequently been denied by the First Department. 
See Bailey Decl., Ex. 3, ECF No. 27-3.                                                    

      Gristina has now come to this Court seeking the same relief: to compel the state trial court 
to unseal the transcripts from August 13 and 16, 2012.  Her Complaint asserts a single claim under 
42 U.S.C. § 1983, specifically, that Gristina’s Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process, equal 
protection, and access to the courts have been violated because of her inability to review the 
transcripts. See Complaint § 29. The lawsuit names as defendants Justice Merchan and the District 
Attorney who opposed Gristina’s motion to unseal. Gristina seeks injunctive and declaratory relief 
“directing the Defendants to allow Gristina to pay for, and obtain, the unsealed court minutes in 

2 Because the court reporters had provided Gristina’s counsel with a portion of each transcript, 
Justice Merchan ordered those portions returned or destroyed after concluding they had been 
mistakenly unsealed.  See Trial Court Decision at A005. 
3 Gristina’s motion in the trial court also requested transcripts from other appearances that are not 
at issue here.  A second transcript from August 16—involving a matter in which Gristina had been 
present—had never been sealed was available to her at any time.  Transcripts from two other 
days—November 20 and December 5, 2012—had likewise never been sealed.  And from the day 
of Gristina’s actual guilty plea—September 25, 2012—Justice Merchan ordered the transcript to 
be retrieved from storage and, assuming it was not sealed, made available to Gristina.  See Trial 
Court Decision at A006.

her criminal case so that Gristina can access the courts to make a meaningful motion to vacate the 
judgment” and conviction in her criminal case.  id. {{/31-32.  The Defendants have moved to 
dismiss. 
                                DISCUSSION 
     The Defendants assert several overlapping challenges to Gristina’s lawsuit under Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), including abstention under the Younger doctrine, 
abstention under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine,  and absolute immunity.  The Court concludes 
abstention is required. 
 I.    Abstention under Younger is Required 
         A.  Legal Standards 
      Younger abstention provides that “federal courts should generally refrain from enjoming 
or otherwise interfering in ongoing state proceedings.”  Spargo v. N.Y. State Comm'n on Judicial 
Conduct, 351 F.3d 65, 74 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1971)).* 
The Supreme Court has identified three categories of state proceedings that implicate Younger 
abstention: (1) “ongoing state criminal prosecutions;” (2) “certain civil enforcement proceedings;” 
and (3) “pending civil proceedings involving certain . .  . orders uniquely in furtherance of the state 
courts’ ability to perform their judicial functions.”  Sprint Communs., Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 
78 (2013).  These three categories are “narrow” and exclusive.  Cavanaugh v. Geballe, 28 F.4th 
428, 430, 433 (2d Cir. 2022).  When a Younger category applies, abstention is mandatory, and the 
federal district court must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  See Colorado Water Conserv. Dist. v. 
United States, 424 U.S. 800, 816 n.22 (1976). 

4 Unless otherwise indicated, in quoting cases all internal quotation marks, alterations, emphases, 
footnotes, and citations are omitted.

     Despite the delineation of clear categories, Younger continues to present “complexities and 
uncharted ground.”  Trump v. Vance, 941 F.3d 631, 639 (2d Cir. 2019).  The varied applications 
of the third Younger category—the category at issue in this case—illustrate that uncharted ground. 
“{T]wo types of orders that clearly fall within that category” are “civil contempt orders and orders 
requiring the posting of bonds pending appeal.”  Cavanaugh, 28 F.Ath at 433 (citing Sprint, 571 
U.S. at 79). But other civil proceedings also merit abstention when they uniquely further the state’s 
judicial function.  For example, the third category has applied to a state court order requiring a 
parent to pay half of the fees of an attorney appointed to represent his children in a divorce 
proceeding.  See Falco v. Justs. of the Matrimonial Parts of Supreme Ct. of Suffolk Cty., 805 F.3d 
425, 427-28 (2d Cir. 2015).  There, the Second Circuit concluded the order was “integral to the 
State court’s ability to perform its judicial function in divorce and custody proceedings,” lest those 
children go unrepresented in court.  Id.  By contrast, the third category of Younger did not apply 
in a probate context where a state court had issued an order recognizing the validity of a lien.  See 
Cavanaugh, 28 F.4th at 434. That order did not affect the processes underpinning the state court’s 

own case management; instead, it “merely affect{ed] how the executor [would] administer[] the 
estate.”  Id.  Overall, the Second Circuit has distilled “from these cases that federal courts should 
refrain from interfering with core state court civil administrative processes, powers, and functions 
that allow the state courts to adjudicate the matters before them and enforce their judgments.”  Id. 
      Although the Younger categories are exclusive, a federal court may also “appropriately 
consider three additional factors laid out in Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State 
Bar Association, 457 U.S. 423 (1982), that further counsel in favor of abstention: Whether “there 
is (1) an ongoing state judicial proceeding [that] (2) implicates important state interests and (3)

provides  an adequate  opportunity to raise  federal challenges.”  Cavanaugh,  28  F.Ath  at 432 
(quoting Sprint, 571 U.S. at 81). 
        B.  Application 
     Gristina’s Article 78 Petition in the state appellate court—which calls for review of □□□ 
trial court’s sealing decision—requires this Court to abstain under Younger.  A court’s order to 
seal or unseal its own transcripts falls within the “core state court civil administrative processes, 
powers, and functions” that make up the third category’ of Younger abstention.  Cavanaugh, 28 
F4th at 434.  There is no doubt that the power to seal a transcript is a quintessentially judicial 
function. Indeed, “courts have the inherent power to control the records of their own proceedings.” 
Crain  Comme’ns,  Inc.  v.  Hughes,  539 N.E.2d  1099  (N.Y.  1989);  see also Nixon  v.  Warner 
Comme’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978) (“[T]he right to inspect and copy judicial records is not 
absolute.  Every court has supervisory power over its own records and files, and access has been    □□ 
denied where court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes.”).  Court transcripts 
are records of the very “performance of the judicial function” itself.  United States v. Amodeo, 44 
F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995); Murphy v. Warden of Attica Corr. Facility, No. 20-CV-3076 (PAE) 
(JLC), 2020 WL 6866403, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 23, 2020).  Without the ability to maintain 
confidentiality during certain proceedings, state courts could not “adjudicate the matters before 
them” lest public disclosure chill the candor those courts depend upon.  Cavanaugh, 28 F.4th at 

5 The Attorney General also argues the first category of Younger applies.  To be sure, Justice      
Merchan’s decision regarding the sealed transcripts was part of Gristina’s criminal prosecution 
and was captioned as such. However, that prosecution was not “ongoing” at the time Gristina filed 
this federal lawsuit.  Sprint, 5571 U.S. at 78.  After the sealing order, there do not appear to be any 
ongoing criminal issues for  Justice Merchan to resolve, given that Gristina completed her sentence 
years ago.  By contrast, Gristina’s Article 78  civil proceeding is considered by this  Court as 
“ongoing,” as discussed in the Middlesex analysis below.

434: see also Hartford Courant Co. y. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2004) (observing that 
certain records “function properly only if kept secret”). 
     Moreover, the decision to seal a transcript is procedural.  The state court’s process must 
balance  multiple  competing  interests,  including  the  public’s  right  to  open  proceedings,  the 
defendant’s right to a fair trial, and the need to protect witnesses and incentivize full disclosure of 
evidence.  See In re Daily News, L.P. v. Wiley, 126 A.D.3d 511, 512 (N.Y. App. Div. ist Dep't 
2015).  Gristina thus challenges “the way that New York courts manage their own” criminal 
proceedings through deciding what judicial documents must be sealed.  Cavanaugh, 28 F.4th at 
434 (emphasis in original) (quoting Falco, 805 F.3d at 427).  To second-guess the confidentiality 
of state court transcripts—a decision which those courts must make every day—“would directly 
impede the normal course of . . . proceedings in the state courts.” Disability Rts. New York v. New 
York, 916 F.3d  129,  136-137 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting O’Shea v.  Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 500 
(1974)).  Gristina’s challenge in this Court falls squarely within the third category of Younger. 
      The additional Middlesex factors further counsel in favor of abstention.® 
      First, the state proceeding was still “pending” at the time Gristina began this case.  The 
Complaint noted Gristina’s intention to appeal her Article 78 Petition to the New York Court of 
Appeals. “[A] necessary concomitant of Younger is that a party .  .. must exhaust his state appellate 
remedies before seeking relief in the District Court.”  Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 608 
(1975).’  The fact that permission to appeal was subsequently denied is irrelevant; the Court must 

6 Gristina has not alleged bad faith, harassment, or some other extraordinary circumstance that 
would make abstention inappropriate.  See Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 429. 
7 Although it is “typically true” that Gristina could bring her § 1983 in federal court without having 
to  exhaust  her  state  remedies,  the  exhaustion  requirement  reanimates  “where  Younger’s 
requirements are met.” Astoria Gen. Contracting Corp. v. Off. of Comptroller of City of New York, 
159 F, Supp. 3d 385, 398 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).

consider abstention as of the date the federal Cormplaint was filed.  See Int’l Fidelity Ins. Co. v. 
City of New  York, 263  F.  Supp.  2d 619,  633  (E.D.N.Y.  2003).  Further, no  “proceedings of 
substance on the merits have taken place in federal court.”   McGRX, Inc. v. Vermont, 452 F. App’x 
74, 75 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 349 (1975)). 
     Second, Gristina’s lawsuit implicates important state interests.  This factor, which largely 
mirrors the rationale of the third Younger category, does not require much elaboration.  In short, 
“few interests can be considered more central than a state’s interest in regulating its own judicial 
system.”  Spargo, 351 F.3d at 75 (citing Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 
829, 848 (1978)). 
      Third, Gristina’s state case provides an adequate opportunity to raise the same federal 
claims that she raises here.  The measure of adequate opportunity asks “only whether the state’s 
procedural remedies  could provide the relief sought[,]  not whether the state will provide the 
constitutional ruling which the plaintiff seeks.”  Kaufman vy. Kaye, 466 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir. 2006) 
(emphasis in original) (quoting Sparge, 351 F.3d at 79).  The Article 78 Petition challenged the 
sealing decision using the same federal theories Gristina uses in this case: due process, equal 
protection, and access to the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Article 78 Petition at 
  26-29.  “Without question, the New York courts can consider the constitutional questions 
[Gristina] raises and order relief if they deem them to have merit,” and Gristina does not allege the 
New York courts are incapable of doing so.  Kaufman, 466 F.3d at 87; see also Reinhardt v. Mass. 
Dep’t of Social Servs.,  715  F.  Supp.  1253,  1257  (S.D.N.Y.  1989)  (“The  Second Circuit has 
repeatedly sanctioned abstention when the plaintiff's federal claims can be raised in an Article 78 
proceeding.”’) (collecting cases),  Gristina also remains free to petition the Supreme Court of the

United States to review her state case.  See Kaufman, 466 F.3d at 87-88; Strong v. New York City 
Dep’t of Educ., No. 18-CV-4663 (LLS), 2018 WL 10579836, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2018). 
     Because the third category  of Younger abstention applies,  and because the Middlesex 
factors all bolster the decision to do so, the Court must abstain from exercising jurisdiction. 
Il.    Abstention under Rooker-Feldman is also Required                                   
      The District Attorney argues (though Justice Merchan does not) that the Rooker-Feldman 
doctrine also bars this Court from adjudicating Gristina’s transcript dispute. 
         A.  Legal Standards 
      Like Younger abstention, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine applies to dismiss certain actions 
for want of jurisdiction.  See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 291 
(2005) (citing D.C. Ct, of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983), Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 
263 U.S. 413 (1923)).  Under Rooker-Feldman, federal district courts lack jurisdiction when the 
plaintiff (1) lost in state court, (2) complains of injuries caused by the state court judgment, (3) 
invites the district court to review and reject the state court judgment, and (4) commenced the 
district court proceedings after the state court judgment was rendered.  See Exxon Mobil, 544 U.S. 
at 284: Vossbrinck v. Accredited Home Lenders, Inc., 773 F.3d 423, 426 (2d Cir. 2014).  The 
doctrine “recognizes that 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is a grant of original jurisdiction, and does not authorize 
district courts to exercise appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments,” with such federal 
jurisdiction reserved exclusively for the Supreme Court of the United States.  Verizon Md., Inc. v. 
Pub. Serv. Comm’n of Md., 535 U.S. 635, 644 n.3 (2002), 
         B.  Application 
      Given the complicated procedural history in Gristina’s state court cases, the Court must 
untangle the previous Younger analysis from the subsequent Rooker-Feldman analysis.  Younger

applies to certain “ongoing” state court cases, while Rooker-Feldman applies to “final” state court 
judgments. Gristina’s lawsuit implicates both “ongoing” (the Article 78 Petition, which at the time 
this case was filed, she sought to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals) and “final” (the Trial 
Court Decision) components.  Regardless of the appeal of the Article 78 Petition, the Trial Court 
Decision remains “final.”  See Citibank, N.A. v. Swiatkowski, No. 12-CV-0196, 2012 WL 542681, 
at *4 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2012); (“The fact that [Gristina] had an appeal pending before the 
Appellate Division at the time of removal does not affect the Rooker-Feldman analysis.”).  For 
purposes of Rooker-Feldman, the Court therefore examines the Trial Court Decision. 
      There is no dispute the Trial Court Decision meets three of four the Rooker-Feldman 
requirements.  Gristina lost her motion to unseal the transcripts she now seeks.  She invites this 
Court to overturn Justice Merchan’s decision and order the transcripts to be unsealed.  And she 
filed her Complaint in this Court after  Justice Merchan had denied her motion in relevant part.  She 
thus invites a straightforward “review and rejection” of the state trial court’s decision.  Exxon 
Mobil, 544 U.S. at 284. 
      The  second  Rooker-Feldman  requirement  is  less  straightforward.   Gristina’s  alleged 
injury—her inability to review the sealed transcripts—was certainly caused by Justice Merchan’s 
decision to keep those transcripts sealed.  But it is debatable is whether that decision is considered 
a “judgment” for purposes of Rooker-Feldman.  Gristina argues the collateral decision to seal the 
transcripts is not a “judgment” under New York law.  See N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 1.20 (15) (“A 
judgment is comprised of a conviction and the sentence imposed thereon and is completed by 
imposition and entry of the sentence.”); Berman v. United States, 302 U.S. 211, 212 (1937) (“Final 
judgment in a criminal case means sentence.  The sentence is the judgment.”).  After all, Gristina 

                                      10 

seeks the transcripts so she can challenge her criminal conviction and sentence at some unknown 
point in the future. 
     Yet the operative word “judgment” appears to broader in the Rooker-Feldman context than 
the term is otherwise understood.  “[T]he form of the proceeding is not significant.  It is the nature 
and effect which is controlling.”  Feldman, 460 U.S. at 482.  Indeed, courts in this Circuit have 
applied the doctrine to post-judgment orders similar to the sealing decision at issue here.  See 
Bobrowsky v. Yonkers Courthouse, 777 F. Supp. 2d 692, 705-06 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (state judge’s 
protective  order preventing  the  federal  plaintiff from  approaching  her  mother  was  a  “final 
decision” under Rooker-Feldman, even though plaintiff had already been criminally convicted); 
Zahl vy, Kosovsky, No. 08-CV-8308 (LTS) (THK), 2011 WL 779784, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2011) 
(“The distinction between the earlier ‘judgment’  and each post-judgment ‘decision and order,’ 
which did not contemplate any further proceedings and which were no longer appealable at the 
time the instant action was filed, is purely nomenclatural and thus immaterial for Rooker-Feldman      □ 
purposes.”),  aff'd, 471  F. App’x 34 (2d Cir.  2012).  Justice Merchan’s sealing decision was 
sufficiently final to satisfy the essential objective of Rooker-Feldman’s “judgment” requirement, 
as the decision sealed the transcripts permanently and contemplated no further action by the trial    _ 
court.  Cf Green v. Mattingly, 585 F.3d 97, 102 (2d Cir. 2009). With its requirements met, Rooker- 
Feldman provides an alternative basis to abstain from exercising jurisdiction. 
III.    Remaining Arguments 
     Given that the Court has found two independent jurisdictional reasons to dismiss, it need 
not reach the Defendants’ arguments that they enjoy absolute immunity, and that Gristina fails to 
state a claim on the merits.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 323 U.S. 83, 93 
(1998). 

                                      11 

     Finally, although the District Attorney argues that amending the Complaint would be futile, 
the Court shall not dismiss with prejudice.  “[W]here a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it 
also lacks the power to dismiss with prejudice.”  Hernandez v. Conriv Realty Assocs., 182 F.3d 
121, 123 (2d Cir. 1999); Novie v. Vill. of Montebello, No. 10-CV-9436 (CS), 2012 WL 3542222, 
at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 16, 2012) (dismissing without prejudice on Younger abstention grounds). 
                               CONCLUSION 
     Gristina may continue her quest to unseal the transcripts in state court, but having chosen 
that path, she cannot simultaneously do so here in federal court.  The Defendants’ motions to 
dismiss are GRANTED and this case is DISMISSED without prejudice. 
     The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motions at ECF numbers 20 and 23 and close 
this case.
