reason_for_appeal: '=== Jack in the Box Inc.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Jack in the Box argued that the district court erred at summary judgment in finding that its Workers’ Benefit Fund (WBF) overdeductions were willful, thereby improperly exposing it to penalty wages under Oregon law.

  2. Jack in the Box contended that, even if penalty wages were potentially available, plaintiffs had waived the so‑called ''Late Final Pay 1'' penalty‑wage theory, and the district court erred by allowing plaintiffs to present that theory and seek those damages at trial.

  3. Jack in the Box asserted that, even if it were liable for penalty wages, the classwide penalty‑wage award for the WBF overdeductions was unconstitutionally excessive under the Due Process Clause because it was grossly disproportionate to the actual overdeductions and punitive in nature.

  4. Jack in the Box argued that the district court abused its discretion by including in the WBF class those members whose mailed class notices were returned as undeliverable, claiming that the notice process was not the ''best notice practicable'' and that such members should have been excluded from the class and any damages award.

  5. Jack in the Box contended that the district court erred in refusing to toll or reduce prejudgment interest on plaintiffs’ WBF recovery for periods in which plaintiffs allegedly caused unreasonable delay in prosecuting the case, and in holding that it lacked discretion under Oregon law to do so.

  6. Jack in the Box further argued, in response to the cross‑appeal, that plaintiffs’ cross‑appeal was untimely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a), and that the court therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider it.


  === Jessica Gessele; Ashley Ortiz; Nicole Gessele; Tricia Tetrault; Christina Mauldin, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to certify a class for their unpaid break claims, asserting that liability for shortened meal periods did not require individualized inquiries into the reasons each break was shortened and was suitable for classwide adjudication.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in granting Jack in the Box’s renewed Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law on the named plaintiffs’ individual unpaid break claims, arguing that they could prevail individually based on Jack in the Box’s alleged breach of its On‑Duty Meal Policy Agreements with them.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred at summary judgment in granting Jack in the Box’s affirmative defense that the shoe‑purchase wage deductions were ''for the employees’ benefit'' under Or. Rev. Stat. § 652.610(3)(b), thereby improperly removing that issue from the jury.

  4. Plaintiffs contended that the district court abused its discretion in decertifying the previously certified shoe class, asserting that common issues—particularly whether the shoe deductions were for employees’ benefit—continued to predominate and that class treatment remained appropriate.

  5. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred post‑trial by holding that written authorization for the shoe deductions was a complete defense to all of their shoe‑related claims, including minimum wage and overtime claims under Or. Rev. Stat. § 653.055, and by using that reasoning to override the jury’s penalty‑wage award on the named plaintiffs’ individual shoe claims.

  6. Plaintiffs further contended that, with respect to their minimum wage and overtime shoe claims under Or. Rev. Stat. § 653.055, the district court improperly treated written authorization under Or. Rev. Stat. § 652.610(3)(b) as a defense, even though that statute does not limit liability for paying less than the minimum wage or required overtime.'
