outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Hospital Amerimed Cancun S A de C V and Hospital Quirurgica Del Sur (the Hospitals)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. The Hospitals argued that they were not required to exhaust administrative remedies because their common-law claims for negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel do not arise under the Medicare Act.

  2. The Hospitals contended that, alternatively, they should have been exempted from the administrative exhaustion requirement because, as foreign hospitals, they cannot participate in Medicare''s administrative remedies process.

  3. The Hospitals argued that their complaints plausibly alleged common-law claims for relief and thus should not have been dismissed for failure to state a claim.'
