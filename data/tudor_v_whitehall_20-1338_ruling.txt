                  SUMMARY ORDER                                  
On April 19, 2023, defendant Whitehall Central School District filed a
bill of costs, seeking a total of $1,659.75.  (Dkt. No. 41.)  On May 10,
2023, plaintiff Angel Tudor opposed the imposition of costs, contending
that she has limited financial resources and that the case involved “difficult
issues.”  (Dkt. Nos. 43, 44.)  For the reasons explained below, costs are

disallowed.1                                                          

1  The procedural mechanisms used by the parties in bringing about
review of the bill of costs are somewhat misguided.  First, the District filed
its bill of costs as a “Motion for Bill of Costs.”  (Dkt. No. 41.)  The
applicable rule, however, contemplates the taxation of costs by the clerk
on fourteen days notice.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1).  And the Local
Rules of Practice make clear that a party entitled to costs “shall file . . . a
verified bill of costs . . . .”  N.D.N.Y. L.R. 54.1(a).  Second, Tudor filed an
affidavit in opposition and memorandum of law, (Dkt. Nos. 43, 44)  — her
confusion may have been caused by the District’s initial motion — instead
of moving for a review of the taxation of costs as set out in the Federal
This Americans with Disabilities Act2 matter was brought by Tudor in
connection with her employment at the District.  (Dkt. Nos. 1, 9.)  The

parties stipulated to the dismissal of all but a failure to accommodate
claim, (Dkt. No. 16), and summary judgment was granted to the District on
that claim because Tudor could not establish that an accommodation was
necessary for her to perform the essential functions of her job as a  

teacher, (Dkt. No. 35).  Tudor thereafter requested and was granted leave
to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP).  (Dkt. Nos. 45, 47.)               
Pursuant to Rule 54(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

and as relevant here, the prevailing party should be allowed costs other
than attorney’s fees.  Recoverable fees include                       
     (1)  Fees of the clerk and marshal;                         
     (2)  Fees  for  printed  or  electronically  recorded       
          transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the        
          case;                                                  
     (3)  Fees  and  disbursements  for  printing  and           
          witnesses;                                             
     (4)  Fees  for  exemplification  and  the  costs  of        
          making  copies  of  any  materials  where  the         
          copies are necessarily obtained for use in the         
          case;                                                  
Rules, or objecting within fourteen days as specified in Local Rule 54.1(a). 
In any event, the court overlooks the procedural irregularities and reaches
the merits.

     (5)  Docket fees under section 1923 of this title;          
     (6)  Compensation  of  court  appointed  experts,           
          compensation  of  interpreters,  and  salaries,        
          fees,  expenses,  and  costs  of  special

The non-prevailing party “bears the burden of showing that costs 
should not be awarded.”  Parks v. Blanchette, No. 3:09-CV-604 (VAB),  
2016 WL 1408075, at *1 (D. Conn. Apr. 8, 2016) (citing Whitfield v. Scully,
241 F.3d 264, 270 (2d Cir. 2001), abrogated on other grounds by Bruce v.
Samuels, 577 U.S. 82 (2016)).  “Denial of costs is appropriate where the

losing party has ‘limited financial resources’ or the case involved difficult
questions or an issue of public importance.”  Id. (quoting Whitfield, 241
F.3d at 270).                                                         
Tudor’s opposition to the bill of costs is premised on her “limited

resources” and her contention that the case involved difficult legal issues. 
(Dkt. No. 44.)  The District argues that Tudor’s financial situation could
improve by virtue of her ability to return to work, an award of disability or

Workers’ Compensation benefits, or an award of damages in a different 
action pending in this court, and that the case did not present difficult legal
issues because it identified the very shortcomings that resulted in   

                          3                                      
summary judgment being granted in a letter sent to Tudor months before 
her deposition.  (Dkt.  No. 45 at 2-4.) 
 Although this case did  not present particularly difficult issues of law, 
Tudor’s limited financial resources counsel against the imposition of costs. 
The District’s argument about potential avenues by which Tudor may, one 
day,  be able to pay costs is speculative.  As noted above, Tudor was 
granted leave to appeal  IFP based upon a declaration, which 
demonstrates indigency and meets her burden to demonstrate that she is 
of limited resources.  Accordingly, the bill of costs is disallowed. 
 Accordingly,  it is hereby 
 ORDERED that the District’s bill of costs (Dkt.  No. 41) is 
DISALLOWED: and it is further 
 ORDERED that the Clerk provide a copy of this Summary Order to 
the parties. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

                      SUMMARY ORDER                                   
    Plaintiff Angel Tudor brings this action against defendant Whitehall
Central School District alleging a failure to accommodate claim1 pursuant
to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).2  (Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 9.) 
Now pending is the District’s motion for summary judgment.  (Dkt. No. 22.) 
For the reasons that follow, the District’s motion is granted.         

    The District is a public school district located in Washington County,
New York.  (Def.’s Statement of Material Facts (SMF) ¶ 1, Dkt. No. 22, 


     1  Tudor originally alleged additional claims pursuant to New York
State Human Rights Law and New York Executive Law, however, the       
parties stipulated to their dismissal.  (Dkt. No. 16.)                
     2  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-213.                                   
Attach. 1.)3  Tudor has been an employee of the District since 2006 as a
substitute teacher, and, subsequently, as a full-time teacher.  (Id. ¶ 2.) 

Patrick Dee is the District’s Superintendent, and Brian Keller is the  
Principal of the District’s Junior-Senior High School.  (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.)  Tudor
has sought accommodations from the District for her Post-Traumatic     

Stress Disorder (PTSD).  (Id. ¶ 7.)  The District asserts that Tudor sought
“the ability to take three, uninterrupted breaks of at least fifteen minutes in
duration each day during which [Tudor] was permitted to leave” school  
grounds.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  Tudor objects to this characterization of her    

accommodation request, maintaining that she only requested two fifteen-
minute breaks, and that a third break, during lunch, “was not requested nor
provided as an accommodation but was provided as matter of law         

irrespective any accommodation request.”  (Pl.’s SMF ¶ 8, Dkt. No. 32.)  
     3  Unless noted otherwise, the facts are undisputed.  To the extent
Tudor disputes any of the facts asserted by the District, but fails to cite
record support that shows an actual dispute, the fact is deemed admitted
pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(b).  Further, to the extent Tudor asserts 
additional facts or makes arguments in her responsive paragraphs that do
not directly dispute the facts alleged in the District’s statement, these
“facts” and arguments will not be considered in connection with this  
summary judgment motion “because they have not been submitted         
through the procedure outlined by N.D.N.Y. L.R. [56].”  See Lomonoco v.
Saint Anne Inst., No. 1:15-CV-1163, 2018 WL 2324051, at *1 (N.D.N.Y.  
May 22, 2018).                                                        
                               2                                      
    During the 2019-2020 school year, the period at issue here, (id. ¶¶
70, 73, 76-78; see Am. Compl. ¶ 76), Tudor was only required to report to

work in-person for one hundred days of the 2019-2020 school year, with 
the remainder of the school year being conducted remotely as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic.  (Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 51-52, 54.)  On the one hundred 

days Tudor was required to work in person during the 2019-2020 school  
year, she was permitted to take a break every morning during her “prep 
period,” and also took a break during her lunch.  (Id. ¶¶ 44-45.)      
Additionally, the District asserts that Keller scheduled Tudor to be assigned

an unpopulated study hall every afternoon during the 2019-2020 school  
year so that she could take an afternoon break.  (Id. ¶¶ 24, 31, 39.)  Tudor
disputes the fact that the study hall was unpopulated, noting that there

were occasionally students present, and, additionally, maintains that Keller
did not express to her that she was permitted to leave during the study hall
or that it was being provided as an accommodation.  (Pl.’s SMF ¶¶ 24, 31,

39.)  However, Tudor was able to take an afternoon break on “[m]ost days,”
leaving the building in the afternoon on ninety-one days.  (Def.’s SMF ¶¶
44-47.)  After the transition to remote instruction, Tudor “was able to take
breaks when she needed them.”  (Id. ¶ 55.)                             

                               3                                      
    With respect to the 2019-2020 school year, Tudor “admit[ed] that . . .
she could perform the essential functions of her job even though she was

not granted her accommodation request,” albeit “under great duress and 
harm.”  (Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 14 at 3-4; see id., Attach. 13 at 3; see id.,
Attach. 4 at 126-28; Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 84, 86.)  “No one at the [school d]istrict

expressed any concerns to [Tudor] about her job performance during the 
2019-2020 school year,” Tudor “was not counseled or disciplined,” and she
“did not lose any compensation or benefits.”  (Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 88, 92-94.) 
    Tudor filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity        

Commission (EEOC) in March 2020, regarding the District’s alleged failure
to accommodate her during the 2019-2020 school year.  (Id. ¶¶ 69-70.)  
Tudor thereafter received a right to sue notice in connection with that

EEOC charge.  (Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 8.)                                
    The standard of review under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 is well settled and
will not be repeated here.  For a full discussion of the governing standard,

the court refers the parties to its prior decision in Wagner v. Swarts, 827 F.
Supp. 2d 85, 92 (N.D.N.Y. 2011), aff’d sub nom. Wagner v. Sprague, 489 
F. App’x 500 (2d Cir. 2012).                                           
    The District argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because

                               4                                      
Tudor has not established that she is considered disabled under the ADA. 
(Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 2 at 12-14.)  In the alternative, the District contends

that, while it did not provide Tudor with the exact accommodation she  
requested, it provided a reasonable alternative accommodation.  (Id. at 14-
21.)  Further the District maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment

because Tudor “admits that she was able to perform her essential job   
duties during the 2019-2020 school year with the accommodations that   
were provided to her by the District, albeit under ‘great duress and harm’”
and faced no “adverse employment action as a result of any alleged failure

by the District to accommodate her disability.”  (Id. at 16-19.)4      
    Tudor argues that she has adequately established that she is      
considered disabled under the ADA.  (Dkt. No. 33 at 10-20.)  Tudor further

contends that “Keller did not tell her that the afternoon study [hall] was
being provided to her as [alternative] accommodation” which “compelled 

     4  Additionally, the District maintains that, “[t]o the extent . . . [Tudor]
claims that the District violated the ADA by failing to engage in the ADA
interactive process,” there “is no independent cause of action for” such
action, (Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 2 at 19-20), which is correct.  See Kugel v.
Queens Nassau Nursing Home Inc., 568 F. Supp. 3d 253, 262 (E.D.N.Y.   
2021) (“Second Circuit case law is clear that failure to engage in a  
good-faith interactive process under ADA . . . does not state an      
independent cause of action.” (collecting cases)).                    
                               5                                      
[her] to accommodate herself by leaving the building during her study hall
under threat of discipline.”  (Id. at 19, 21.)  Finally, Tudor maintains that

such a failure to accommodate her violated the ADA because her         
proposed accommodation was reasonable and would have allowed her to    
“perform the essential functions of [her] employment position.”  (Id. at 21-

28.)                                                                   
    An employer may be liable under the ADA where it fails to make    
“reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of
an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.”  42 U.S.C.       

§ 12112(b)(5)(A); see McBride v. BIC Consumer Prod. Mfg., 583 F.3d 92, 
96 (2d Cir. 2009).  To make a prima facie showing of an employer’s failure
to accommodate, a plaintiff must establish:                            

         “(1) the plaintiff is a person with a disability under the   
         meaning of the statute in question; (2) an employer          
         covered by the statute had notice of h[er] disability;       
         (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could           
         perform the essential functions of the job at issue;         
         and  (4)  the  employer  has  refused  to  make  such        
         accommodations.”                                             
Norman v. NYU Langone Health Sys., Nos. 20-3624-cv, 20-3745-cv, 2021   
WL 598699, at *3 (2d Cir. Dec. 17, 2021) (quoting Natofsky v. City of New
York, 921 F.3d 337, 352 (2d Cir. 2019)).                               
                               6                                      
    Here, assuming, without deciding, that Tudor is disabled under the
ADA, and that the scheduling arrangement in place regarding her        

afternoon study hall constituted a denial of Tudor’s requested         
accommodation, the District’s motion for summary judgment must still be
granted.  The District points to uncontroverted evidence, including Tudor’s

own admissions, that, regardless of the alleged denial of her          
accommodation, she was able to perform the essential functions of her job,
(Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 84, 86; see Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 14 ¶ 2; see also id., Attach.
13 at 3; id., Attach. 4 at 126-28), and, therefore, no fact finder could

determine she has established the third element of her failure to      
accommodate claim, see Anderson v. Nat’l Grid, PLC, 93 F. Supp. 3d 120,
139 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (granting summary judgment, where “there [wa]s     

insufficient evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that
plaintiff needed a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential   
functions of his job,” because “plaintiff admitted that he met all of his job

performance goals”); see also Harvin v. Manhattan and Bronx Surface    
Transit. Operating Auth., No. 14-CV-5125, 2018 WL 1603872, at *5,      
(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2018) (collecting cases).  Accordingly, the District’s
motion for summary judgment must be granted.                           

                               7                                      
     Accordingly,  it is hereby 
     ORDERED that the District’s motion for summary judgment (DKt. 
No. 22) is GRANTED; and  it is further 
     ORDERED that the amended complaint (Dkt.  No. 9) is DISMISSED; 
and  it is further 
     ORDERED that the Clerk close this case; and  it is further 
     ORDERED that the Clerk provide a copy of this Summary Order to 
the parties. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
