reason_for_appeal: '=== Plaintiffs (Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Ltd., Richard Dennis, FrontPoint European Fund L.P.)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Sherman Act claims by finding that Sonterra and Dennis lacked antitrust standing.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in concluding that FrontPoint European Fund L.P. no longer had litigating capacity and had not assigned its claims to its would-be substitute, Fund Liquidation Holdings, LLC.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing Dennis''s Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) claims for failure to plead specific intent.

  4. Plaintiffs asserted that the district court improperly dismissed their federal claims based on the finding that they failed to allege actual injury under the Sherman Act or CEA.
