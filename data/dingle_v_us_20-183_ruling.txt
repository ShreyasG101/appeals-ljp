ERIC KOMITEE, United States District Judge:                               
         The Court has received Magistrate Judge Bloom’s Report          
and Recommendation (“R&R”) dated March 15, 2023.  ECF No. 73.             
Judge Bloom recommends that I grant the United States Department          
of Education’s (“DOE”) motion to dismiss plaintiff Robert                 
Dingle’s claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,                  
pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil                   
Procedure.  Plaintiff timely objected, contending that the Court          
does have subject matter jurisdiction because this case involves          
questions of federal law, and raising arguments on the merits.            
Pl. Objs. 1-2, ECF No. 76.1                                               
         A district court “may accept, reject, or modify, in             
whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the             
magistrate judge.”  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).  The district court            

    1 Plaintiff’s objection erroneously refers to Magistrate Judge Bloom’s 
R&R as “Judge Komitee’s report.”  Id. at 2.                               
reviews de novo those portions of an R&R to which a party has             
specifically objected.  Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3); see also           
Kruger v. Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd., 976 F. Supp. 2d 290, 296             

(E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“A proper objection is one that identifies the           
specific portions of the R&R that the objector asserts are                
erroneous and provides a basis for this assertion.”), aff’d,              
578 F. App’x 51 (2d Cir. 2014).                                           
         Having conducted a de novo review of the R&R, I adopt           
the R&R in its entirety, excluding the discussion of the merits           
of Dingle’s Fifth Amendment claim; because the Court lacks                
subject matter jurisdiction over Dingle’s claims for the reasons          
set forth in the R&R, I do not reach the merits.  See Makarova            
v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000) (a federal             
district court may entertain a lawsuit only when it has both the          
“statutory [and] constitutional power to adjudicate it”).                 

         Accordingly, DOE’s motion to dismiss is granted.                
Dingle’s amended complaint is dismissed without prejudice for             
lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The Clerk of Court is               
respectfully directed to enter judgment and close this case.              
         SO ORDERED.

ERIC KOMITEE, United States District Judge:                               
         The Court has received Magistrate Judge Bloom’s Report          
and Recommendation (“R&R”) dated March 15, 2023.  ECF No. 73.             
Judge Bloom recommends that I grant the United States Department          
of Education’s (“DOE”) motion to dismiss plaintiff Robert                 
Dingle’s claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction,                  
pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil                   
Procedure.  Neither party has filed objections and the time to            
do so has expired.  Accordingly, the Court reviews Judge Bloom’s          
recommendation for clear error on the face of the record.  See            
Advisory Comm. Notes to Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); accord State Farm          
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Grafman, 968 F. Supp. 2d 480, 481                  
(E.D.N.Y. 2013).  Having reviewed the record, I find no clear             
error and therefore adopt the R&R in its entirety.  Thus, DOE’s           
motion to dismiss is granted.  Dingle’s amended complaint is              
dismissed without prejudice.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully          
directed to enter judgment and close this case.                           
         SO ORDERED.
