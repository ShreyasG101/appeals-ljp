outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== 3M Company, Inc.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. 3M argued that the district court erred in remanding the case to state court because 3M satisfied all requirements for federal officer removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), including acting under federal authority, a sufficient ''nexus'' between the alleged conduct and federal authority, and the assertion of a colorable federal defense.

  2. 3M contended that the State of Maine''s disclaimer in its complaint did not eliminate federal officer removal jurisdiction because the alleged PFAS contamination plausibly overlaps and is commingled with PFAS from AFFF use at military facilities, for which 3M has a federal contractor defense.

  3. 3M asserted that the district court improperly required 3M to prove the absence of a colorable federal defense based on the State''s disclaimer, rather than crediting 3M''s theory of the case as required by Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent.

  4. 3M claimed that the State''s disclaimer was not an express waiver sufficient to defeat federal officer removal, as it would require a state court to determine the nexus between the charged conduct and federal authority, which is contrary to the purpose of the removal statute.

  5. 3M argued that it is entitled under the removal statute to have a federal court decide the validity and scope of its federal contractor defense, including factual disputes about commingling and source allocation of PFAS contamination.'
