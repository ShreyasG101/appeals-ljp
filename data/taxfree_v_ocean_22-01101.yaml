outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Tax-Free Fixed Income Fund for Puerto Rico Residents, Inc. et al. (the Funds)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. The Funds argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Section 13(d) claims as moot, contending that the Supplemental Disclosures did not cure the alleged violations because Defendants-Appellees continued to deny the existence of an undisclosed 13D group.

  2. The Funds contended that their amended complaint plausibly pleaded the existence of an undisclosed 13D group if the district court had considered their allegations cumulatively.

  3. The Funds argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Section 14(a) claims, asserting that to cure their filings, Defendants-Appellees would have had to disclose ''the truth'' to shareholders, not just the existence of the lawsuit.

  4. The Funds contended that they pleaded multiple examples of materially false and misleading omissions and representations in Defendants-Appellees'' proxy statements, including misstatements about the level of shareholder support for their nominees, their intent to liquidate the funds, and their ''aligned'' interests with shareholders.

  5. The Funds objected to the district court''s dismissal of their Section 20(a) claim, which was based on the dismissal of their underlying securities claims.

  6. The Funds requested that the appellate court vacate the judgment on Defendants-Appellees'' counterclaims, which ordered the Funds to seat CCI''s victorious nominees for the board of directors of PRRTFF I, PRRTFF VI, and TFF I.'
