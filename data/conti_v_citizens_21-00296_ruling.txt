                   MEMORANDUM AND ORDER                                  

Mary S. McElroy, United States District Judge.                            
    This matter raises the question of whether a national bank—here, defendant 
Citizens Bank, N.A. (“Citizens”)—is subject to a state statute that requires a lender’s 
payment of interest on a mortgage escrow account or whether, as to national banks, 
the state statute is preempted by the National Bank Act (“NBA”).  The plaintiff, John 
Conti, brings this putative class action against Citizens, his mortgage lender, for 
failure to pay that interest on his escrow account.  Citizens moves to dismiss the 
matter on the grounds of federal preemption.                              
    For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Citizens’ Motion (ECF No. 15). 
                        I.   BACKGROUND                                  

    In July 2011, the plaintiff, John Conti, purchased a residential property in 
Cranston, Rhode Island.  (ECF No. 1 ¶ 16.)  Mr. Conti financed the purchase with a 
loan from Citizens, which was secured by a mortgage on the property.     Mr. Conti 
makes no allegation that this mortgage was a jumbo loan or was made, guaranteed, 
or insured by a state or federal governmental lending or insuring agency.   
    As a condition of the mortgage loan, Citizens required Mr. Conti to make 

advance payments of municipal property taxes and homeowner’s insurance into an 
escrow account.1  The mortgage agreement between Citizens and Mr. Conti provided 
that, “Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to 
be paid on the [Escrow] Funds, Lender shall not be required to pay Borrower any 
interest or earnings on the Funds.”    ¶ 31.  The mortgage agreement defined 
“Applicable Law” as “all controlling federal, state and local statutes, regulations, 

ordinances and administrative rules and orders (that have the effect of law) as well 
as all applicable final, non-appealable judicial opinions.”2  (ECF No. 18-1 at 3.)  
    Rhode Island law, subject to certain exceptions not relevant here, requires 
banks to pay interest on amounts that customers deposit into mortgage escrow 
accounts.  R.I.G.L. § 19-9-2(a).  Having not received interest payments from Citizens 
on his escrow account, the plaintiff filed this action alleging breach of contract and, 
in the alternative, unjust enrichment.                                    

    Citizens, however, being a national bank chartered under the National Bank 

1 An escrow account is “[a]n account of accumulated funds held by a lender for 
payment of taxes, insurance, or other periodic debts against real property.”   , 
Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).                                   
2 Although the mortgage agreement is not a part of the pleadings, the Court may 
consider it at this motion to dismiss stage because it is referenced in the Complaint 
and because it is a public record.                       , 744 F.3d       
1, 4 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that the court may consider on a motion to dismiss 
“information found in the mortgage itself, public records, documents incorporated 
into the complaint by reference, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice”).  
Act, seeks to dismiss the action, arguing that any state statute requiring it to pay 
interest on escrow accounts is preempted by the National Bank Act.  Preemption 
issues “are ones of law, not of fact, and are amenable to resolution by a motion to 

dismiss the complaint.”           , 549 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2008).      
                II.  MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD                          

    Motions to dismiss on preemption grounds are considered under Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 12(b)(6).     , 549 F.3d at 52.   To survive a motion to dismiss, the complaint 
must state a claim plausible on its face.            , 550 U.S. 544,      
570 (2007).  The Court assesses the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s factual allegations in 
a two-step process.                           , 640 F.3d 1, 11-13 (1st    
Cir. 2011).  “Step one: isolate and ignore statements in the complaint that simply 
offer legal labels and conclusions or merely rehash cause-of-action elements.”  
                             , 669 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2012).  “Step two: 
take the complaint’s well-pled (  non-conclusory, non-speculative) facts as true, 
drawing all reasonable inferences in the pleader’s favor, and see if they plausibly 
narrate a claim for relief.”     “The relevant question … in assessing plausibility is 

not whether the complaint makes any particular factual allegations but, rather, 
whether  ‘the  complaint  warrant[s]  dismissal  because  it  failed    to  render 
plaintiffs’ entitlement to relief plausible.”                , 711        
F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting              , 550 U.S. 544, 569     
n.14 (2007)).                                                             
                        III.  DISCUSSION                                 

 A. The National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1                                 
    The National Bank Act, passed in 1864, created a national banking system and 
established the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) to charter, regulate, 
and oversee national banks.                     , 550 U.S. 1, 6 (2007).   
The NBA created a “dual banking system,” under which banks can be chartered and 
regulated under federal or state law.      , 999 F.3d 130, 135 (2d Cir.   
2021).  “While state banks are organized under state law, ‘[n]ational banks are 
instrumentalities of the Federal government, created for a public purpose, and as 

such necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States.’”  
          , ___ F.4th ___ (2d Cir. 2022), 2022 WL 4241359, at *2 (quoting 
              , 161 U.S. 275, 283 (1896)).                               
    The  NBA  grants  national  banks  the  authority  “[t]o  exercise  …  all  such 
incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking; by 
discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other 
evidences of debt; by receiving deposits; … [and] by loaning money on personal 

security.”  12 U.S.C. § 24.  An “incidental power” is one that “is convenient or useful 
in  connection  with  the  performance  of  one  of  the  bank’s  established  activities 
pursuant to its express powers under the National Bank Act.”              
   , 472 F.2d 427, 432 (1st Cir. 1972).  The NBA expressly authorizes national 
banks to engage in real estate lending.  12 U.S.C. § 371(a).  As such, a national bank’s 
“incidental powers” include the provision of mortgage escrow account services.  
     , 2022 WL 42413549 at *9;   OCC, Interpretive Letter No. 1041, 2005 
WL 3629258, at *2 (Sept. 28, 2005); OCC, Corporate Decision, 1999 WL 74103, at *2 
(Jan. 29, 1999); OCC, Conditional Approval No. 276, 1998 WL 363812, at *9 (May 8, 

1998).                                                                    
    The  NBA  includes  no  requirement  that  national  banks  pay  interest  on 
mortgage and escrow accounts.  Pursuant to OCC regulations, “[a] national bank may 
make real estate loans … without regard to state law limitations concerning: … 
Escrow accounts, impound accounts, and similar accounts.”  12 C.F.R. § 34.4(a)(6). 
    B. Rhode Island General Laws § 19-9-2(a)                             

    Rhode Island law does, however, in most cases, require the payment of interest 
on mortgage escrow accounts.  R.I.G.L. § 19-9-2(a) provides in relevant part that  
    Every  mortgagee  holding  funds  of  a  mortgagor  in  escrow  for  the 
    payment of taxes and insurance premiums with respect to mortgaged    
    property located in this state shall pay or credit interest on those funds 
    at a rate equal to the rate paid to the mortgagee on its regular savings 
    account, if offered, and otherwise at a rate not less than the prevailing 
    market rate of interest for regular savings accounts offered by local 
    financial institutions….                                             

    C. Preemption                                                        
    Under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution “the Laws of 
the United States … shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every 
State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to 
the  Contrary  notwithstanding.”    U.S.  Const.  art.  VI,  cl.  2.    State  laws  can  be 
preempted in three ways: (1) “express preemption,” when there is specific preemption 
language in a federal statute; (2) “field preemption,” when it can be discerned from 
the statutory scheme that Congress intended to leave no room for state law on the 
same subject; and (3) “conflict preemption,” when compliance with state and federal 
law is a “physical impossibility, or when compliance with the state statute would 

frustrate the purposes of the federal scheme.”       , 488 F.3d 525,      
530-31 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting                              , 517        
U.S. 25, 31 (1996)).  This matter concerns conflict preemption.           
    “The  Supreme  Court  has  consistently  recognized  [the  NBA’s]  grant  of 
incidental powers as a ‘grant[] of authority not normally limited by, but rather 
ordinarily pre-empting, contrary state law.”    at 531.  The NBA preempts state 

laws that “prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank’s exercise of its 
powers.”          , 517 U.S. at 33;         , 488 F.3d at 531 (holding    
that “a state law may be preempted by the National Bank Act when it frustrates or 
limits the ability of a national bank to exercise its statutorily granted powers”) (citing 
         , 517 U.S. at 33-34).                                           
    Through the Dodd-Frank Act, which took effect on July 21, 2011, Congress 
codified—but  did  not  change—the  NBA  preemption  standard  set  forth  by  the 

Supreme Court in         . In relevant part, the Dodd-Frank Act provides: 
    State law preemption standards for national banks and subsidiaries   
    clarified:                                                           

    …                                                                    

    (b) Preemption standard.                                             

         (1) In general.  State consumer financial laws are preempted, only 
           if –                                                          
         (A) Application of a State consumer financial law would have a  
           discriminatory effect on national banks, in comparison with   
           the effect of the law on a bank chartered by that State;      

         (B) in accordance with the legal standard for preemption in the 
           decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in         
                           , 517 U.S. 25 (1996), the State consumer      
           financial  law  prevents  or  significantly  interferes  with  the 
           exercise  by  the  national  bank  of  its  powers;  and  any 
           preemption determination under this subparagraph may be       
           made by a court, or by regulation or order of the Comptroller 
           of the Currency on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with   
           applicable law ….                                             
12 U.S.C. § 25b.                                                          

    Applying  the            preemption  principles,  the  First  Circuit,  in 
     , considered a New Hampshire law that prohibited the sale of gift cards 
valued at $100 or less that contain expiration dates or administrative fees.  488 F.3d 
at 528.  In that case, a national bank marketed and sold gift cards that contained 
expiration dates and were subject to administrative fees.    at 529.  The court 
determined that under the NBA, banks have the incidental power to sell gift cards.  
  at 531-32.  The court then considered whether the New Hampshire statute 
“frustrates or limits the ability of a national bank to exercise its statutorily granted 
powers.”    at 531.  The court concluded that because the New Hampshire law placed 
conditions  on  national  banks’  ability  to  sell  gift  cards,  the  law  “significantly 
interferes” with the national bank’s statutory powers and therefore was preempted 
by the NBA.3    at 533.                                                   

3 Another case also is instructive.  In                                   
               , 591 F.2d 417, 419 (1st Cir. 1979), the First Circuit concluded 
that the federal Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”), 12 U.S.C. § 1461, et seq., which 
    R.I.G.L. § 19-9-2(a), like the New Hampshire law in  , places “limits” on 
an incidental power; here, the power to establish escrow accounts.  These limitations 
therefore “significantly interfere” with a national banks’ incidental powers to utilize 

mortgage escrow accounts.     , 488 F.3d at 533;         , 2022 WL        
4241359,  at  *9  (holding  that  a  state  interest-on-escrow  statute  was  preempted 
because “[b]y requiring a bank to pay its customers in order to exercise a banking 
power granted by the federal government, the law would exert control over banks’ 
exercise of that power”).                                                 
    But there is an additional wrinkle.  The Dodd-Frank Act also included an 

amendment to the Truth in Lending Act, effective January 21, 2013, that provides as 
follows:                                                                  
    If prescribed by applicable State or Federal law, each creditor shall pay 
    interest to the consumer on the amount held in any impound, trust, or 
    escrow account that is subject to this section in the manner as prescribed 
    by that applicable State or Federal law.                             

15 U.S.C. § 1639d(g)(3)                                                   

    This provision, however, only governs loans where (1) state or federal law 
requires the establishment of an escrow account; (2) the loan is “made, guaranteed, 
or insured by a State or Federal governmental lending or insuring agency”; (3) the 

governs federal savings and loan associations, preempted the Massachusetts interest-
on-escrow statute.  Pursuant to the authority granted to it under the HOLA, the 
Federal  Home  Loan  Bank  Board  promulgated  a  regulation  setting  forth  the 
circumstances under which federal savings and loan associations were required to 
pay interest on escrow accounts.    at 425.  The First Circuit held that as a result of 
this regulation, HOLA preempted Massachusetts’ interest-on-escrow statute.   at 
425-26.                                                                   
loan is a “jumbo” mortgage; or (4) regulations require the establishment of an escrow 
account.  15 U.S.C. § 1639d(b)(1) – (4).  The plaintiff’s mortgage falls into none of 
these categories and, indeed, the plaintiff acknowledges that he makes no claim for 

violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1639d.                                           
    But the plaintiff argues that § 1639d evinces a congressional intent for an 
abrogation  of  NBA  preemption  of  state  interest-on-escrow  laws  generally.    The 
defendant, for its part, argues that § 1639d, which does not mention preemption, does 
nothing to eliminate NBA preemption of state interest-on-escrow laws.     
    The Court finds neither position well-grounded.  The plaintiff’s position is too 

broad.  The plain language of § 1639d does not express congressional intent to impose 
an  exception  to  NBA  preemption  for  all  mortgage  loans;  rather,  it  created  an 
exception for the select group to which it applies.     , 2022 WL 4241359 at 
*12 (“[I]t is much more harmonious to read the NBA together with Dodd-Frank as a 
decision by Congress to carve out an exception from its general rule, rather than 
expressly imposing a burden on some mortgage loans in order to impliedly impose a 
burden on all of them.”) (quotation omitted).  The defendant’s position, on the other 

hand, is too broad in the opposite fashion—it ignores the carved-out exceptions 
entirely.                                                                 
    Because the plaintiff’s mortgage loan is not of the types subject to §1639d, that 
statute is irrelevant to this case, and it serves only as an indicator of congressional 
intent with respect to the types of loans that it covers.  The general rule of NBA 
preemption instead applies, and here preempts R.I.G.L. § 19-9-2(a).       
    Finally, Citizens argues that the fact that plaintiff seeks to represent a multi-
state class asserting claims under various state interest-on-escrow laws is another 
ground for finding preemption.   ECF No. 17 at 10-11 (citing  , 550 U.S. at 

13-14  (holding  that  national  banks  should  be  independent  of  “limitations  and 
restrictions as various and as numerous as the States”)).   But here no class has been 
certified and the Court considers only the Rhode Island statute upon which the sole 
plaintiff before it claims a violation.         , 554 F. Supp. 3d 186,    
192 (D. Mass. 2021) (“It is well within a district court judge’s discretion to dispose of 
a motion to dismiss before acting on class certification.”)               

                        IV.  CONCLUSION                                  
    The plaintiff has not set forth plausible claims for breach of contract or unjust 
enrichment for Citizens’ alleged violation of R.I.G.L. § 19-9-2(a) because, except for 

loan types not at issue here, that statute is preempted by the National Bank Act.  
Accordingly, Citizens’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 15) is GRANTED.         
IT IS SO ORDERED.
