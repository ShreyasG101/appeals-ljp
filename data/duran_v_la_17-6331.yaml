outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Radames Duran, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in its interpretation of the definition of ''automatic telephone dialing system'' (ATDS) under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. § 227.

  2. Appellant contended that the device used by La Boom Disco, Inc. qualified as an ATDS because it had the capacity either to store telephone numbers, regardless of how those numbers are stored, or to produce telephone numbers using a random or sequential number generator.'
