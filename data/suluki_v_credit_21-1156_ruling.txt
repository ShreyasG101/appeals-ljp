UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
KHALILAH SULUKI,
                        Plaintiff,       |       21-cv-1156 (SHS) 
            v.
                                      |       OPINION &  ORDER 
 CREDIT ONE BANK, NA,
                        Defendant.
SIDNEY H. STEIN, U.S. District Judge. 
   Plaintiff Khalilah Suluki’s (“plaintiff” or “Suluki”) claims arise from alleged identity 
theft perpetrated by her own mother, Khadijah Suluki (“Suluki’s mother” or 
“Khadijah”), whom she claims opened and used various bank accounts in plaintiff's 
name without her knowledge or permission. (Compl. {| 15, ECF No. 1.) Plaintiff alleges 
that Credit One Bank, NA (“Credit One”) either willfully or negligently failed to 
conduct a reasonable investigation into her claims of identity theft in violation of 15 
U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and failed to properly 
report the results of its investigation to the credit reporting agencies (“CRAs”).! 
   Suluki and Credit One have now cross-moved for summary judgment, (See ECF No. 
58, “Credit One MSj”; ECF No. 65, “Suluki MSJ.”) Suluki seeks partial summary 
judgment that a) Credit One’s reporting to the CRAs that Suluki opened or authorized 
the account was inaccurate; b) Credit One failed to properly report the results of its 
investigation to the credit reporting agencies; and c) Credit One’s investigation into her 
claim of identity theft was unreasonable as a matter of law, leaving questions of 
whether the alleged violations of the FCRA were willful or negligent to a jury. (Suluki 
MSJ at 2.) Credit One does not seek summary judgment as to the accuracy of its 
reporting, but does seek summary judgment that its investigation was reasonable as a 
matter of law. (Credit One MSJ at 12.) Credit One also seeks summary judgment that 

1 Plaintiff alleged previously that Credit One “failed to accurately correct and update or delete Plaintiff's 
information for a period of time subsequent to receiving Plaintiffs dispute from [the CRAs] prior to the 
commencement of this action as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b)(1)(E),” Compl. {[ 87, but has not 
pursued that claim here.

whatever the reasonableness of its investigation, its actions were not willful as a matter 
of law and therefore do not warrant punitive damages. (Credit One MSJ at 17.) 
  1.     History 
  Plaintiff Khalilah Suluki is a Brooklyn resident and recent college graduate. (Compl. 
{ 13.) In the summer of 2019, Suluki alleges that while attempting to sign a lease after 
her graduation, she was denied an apartment, leading her to pull her credit reports 
from the three major credit reporting agencies - Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union. 
(Id. [ 13-14.) She was “dismayed to discover that while she was attending college, she 
was the victim of identity theft, as plaintiff's own mother opened various accounts in 
plaintiffs name and maxed out some of plaintiff's pre-existing accounts.” (Id. { 15.) 
According to plaintiff, while she attended college, her mother “would seize the mail 
containing the Accounts’ billing statements and make a few payments to maintain the 
appearance that the Accounts were valid when in actuality they were not.” (Id.  1 18.) 
These allegedly fraudulent accounts were held at three separate banks: Credit One 
Bank, Capital One Bank, and Comenity Capital Bank. (id. {[ 16.) Plaintiff claims that, 
because her “identity was stolen to open [these] account[s],” the information furnished 
by the banks to the reporting agencies “was at all times inaccurate.” (Id. {| 20.) 
  Plaintiff claims that upon discovering these “fraudulent debts,” she “immediately 
disputed the debts with either the actual account holders or the credit reporting 
bureaus.” (Id. { 17.) She represents that, in late 2019, she sent correspondences to 
Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union, requesting that the credit reporting agencies 
“verify and correct the inaccurate, erroneous and unverified representations made by” 
the banks. (Id. [] 21, 24, 27, 42, 45, 48, 63, 66, 69.) She claims that the agencies furnished 
her disputes to the banks, which then “failed to reasonably reinvestigate Plaintiff's 
disputes.” (Id. □□ 22-23, 43-44, 64-65.) She alleges that she contacted the credit reporting 
agencies again in April 2020, and once again requested that they verify and correct the 
inaccurate information. Ud. {{f 30, 33, 36, 51, 54, 57, 72, 75, 78.) Again, she claims that 
after the agencies furnished her disputes to the banks, the banks “failed to reasonably 
reinvestigate Plaintiff's disputes.” (Id. TJ 32, 35, 38, 53, 56, 59, 74, 77, 80.) 
   On February 9, 2021, plaintiff filed this complaint alleging violations of the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. Plaintiff initially brought one claim against 
each of the three banks — Credit One, Capital One, and Comenity Capital — under 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1681s-2(b)(1)(A) and (E), which govern the duties of furnishers of information,

including banks, to CRAs upon notice of a dispute. (Id. TJ 88, 100, 111.) Section 1681s- 
2(b)(1)(A) requires that “[a]fter receiving notice ... of a dispute with regard to the 
completeness or accuracy of any information provided by a  [furnisher] to a consumer 
reporting agency, the [furnisher] shall conduct an investigation with respect to the 
disputed information.” Plaintiff claims that “it is evident that” the banks “failed to 
conduct a reasonable investigation.” (Compl. {1 84, 96, 107.) 
  As a  result of these violations, Suluki claims she “has sustained damages including 
denial of credit, emotional distress, and mental and physical pain.” (Id. {| 88, 100, 111.) 
Suluki also claims that the violations were willful, rendering the banks liable for 
punitive damages pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681n, or at least negligent, entitling plaintiff 
to recovery of actual damages under 15 U.S.C. § 1681o. (id. {J 91, 103, 114.) She thus 
requests actual, statutory, and punitive damages, declaratory relief, and costs and fees. 
(id. TJ 92, 104, 115.) 
  Il.     Legal Standard 
  To prevail on summary judgment,  a movant must show that “there is no genuine 
dispute as to any material fact” such that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under 
the governing law,” and a dispute is “genuine” if “the evidence is such that a 
reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Gayle v. Gonyea, 313 
F.3d 677, 682 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S, 242, 248 
(1986)). 
  When both sides move for summary judgment, courts “are required to assess each 
motion on its own merits and to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
party opposing the motion, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of that 
party.” Wachovia Bank, Nat'l Ass’n v. VCG Special Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd., 661 
F.3d 164, 171 (2d Cir. 2011). “[I]f the moving party is still entitled to judgment as a 
matter of law after all the facts alleged by the nonmoving party are resolved in his favor 
as true, then any remaining factual disputes are neither genuine nor material and will 
not prevent the court from granting the motion.” Frutico S.A. de C.V. 0. Bankers Tr. Co., 
833 F, Supp. 288, 297 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (internal citation omitted). 

2 Stipulations of voluntary dismissal were entered in late 2021 against defendants Comenity Capital Bank 
and Capital One Bank. (ECF Nos. 44, 46.) Accordingly, the only defendant remaining in this action is 
Credit One Bank.

  Ill.    Relevant Facts 
  On November 2, 2017, an individual applied for and was issued a Credit One credit 
card in the name of plaintiff Khalilah Suluki. (Credit One 56.1 J 1, ECF No, 59.) 
According to Credit One, the account was in use and in good standing for nearly two 
years, receiving regular, on-time payments, and according to Suluki herself, the account 
payments were made from a bank account Suluki shared with her mother. (Credit One 
Opp’n, ECF No. 70 at 4.) On July 20, 2019,3 plaintiff called Credit One to allege that her 
mother had opened the account in her name without her permission. (Credit One 56.1    
8.) Credit One claims that it closed the account, but the outstanding balance remained 
pending. (Id.   7.) On that call, Suluki asked that she be provided with the completed 
account application and account statements in order to obtain a police report for 
identity theft. (Id. {| 8.) Credit One requested an address and was provided with an 
address with no apartment number. (Id.) Credit One alleges that it mailed the material 
Suluki requested to the address she provided, but that it was returned as undeliverable. 
(Id.  J 9.) Five days later, plaintiff's mother Khadijah called Credit One, alleging that 
Suluki’s claims were untrue. (Id. J 10.) Khadijah stated that she and Suluki opened the 
account together while Suluki was in college; and that Khadijah had agreed to be 
responsible for the payments to the card to help Suluki build credit. (Id.) 
   On August 15, 2019, Credit One sent Suluki a letter requesting that she complete the 
Affidavit of Fraud and Forgery it had enclosed and that she provide, in addition, an 
identity theft report filed with a law enforcement agency within 45 days. (id. {J 12-13.) 
Plaintiff signed and returned the affidavit affirming that she had “never applied for the 
credit card” and identified her mother as the person who did so without her consent or 
knowledge. (Id.  { 14, ECF No. 60-7.) She did not provide the identity theft report 
requested by Credit One.5 (Id.) Suluki alleges she could not obtain an identity theft 

3 Suluki alleges she called two or three times in July, (Suluki Tr. 57:11-14, ECF No. 60-1), but the parties at 
least agree on this phone call. 
4 Suluki claims that she did not provide this address as Credit One alleges. (Suluki Counter 56.1 
Statement, ECF No. 74 at 9.) She points to a transcript of a July 6, 2019 conversation with Credit One, 
which apparently was the first time she raised the issue with the bank, but which Credit One has not 
acknowledged, in which she asked if Credit One needed her address to investigate, and Credit One said 
it did not. (ECF No, 74-7 at 12:15-23.) But in the recording of the July 20, 2019 conversation provided by 
Credit One in its submission, Suluki does indeed provide an address (without an apartment number) to 
the Credit One representative. (Decl. of Kim Maragos, ECF No, 62-8.) 
5 Suluki insists that because Credit One stated at its deposition that the affidavit Suluki completed is also 
“essentially [an] identity theft report,” defendant cannot point to the lack of the requested identity theft 
report as a reason not to have investigated Suluki’s claims further. (Suluki Counter 56.1 Statement at 14.) 
However, the affidavit form Suluki completed states: “in addition to the affidavit, the following

report filed with law enforcement without the additional information — the account 
application and monthly statements ~- that Credit One allegedly refused to provide to 
her. (Suluki Counter 56.1 at 12.) During this period, someone continued to make 
minimum payments on the card. (Maragos Decl. Ex. D, ECF No. 62-4 at 23-35.) 
  On November 10, 2019, Suluki sent typed letters to the three credit reporting 
agencies stating that her mother had opened accounts with Century 21 and Capital One 
without her consent, and handwrote into the letters that her mother had also opened a 
Credit One account without her consent. (Suluki 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 66-4.) She 
disputed the unauthorized accounts twice each with Trans Union, Equifax, and 
Experian, who in turn filed Automated Credit Dispute Verifications (“ACDVs") with 
the banks, four of which contained claims of identity theft. (Id., ECF No. 66-5.) 
  Credit One received these disputes in late November and early December 2019. 
(Credit One 56.1 { 26.) Three of the disputes were investigated by contractors, and 
another was investigated by Credit One Fraud Specialist John Perry (id.), who was 
deposed in this matter and submitted an affidavit attesting to the steps he took. (Decl. of 
John Perry, ECF No. 61.) Each time, Credit One concluded that the account belonged to 
Suluki. (Id. { 19.) In April 2020, Suluki submitted another letter to the CRAs, and 
Equifax and Experian submitted additional corresponding ACDYVs to Credit One. 
(Credit One 56.1 {| 41.) Credit One received those letters in mid-May. (Id. 11 43, 46.) 
Defendant repeated its process and, given it had received no new information, came to 
the same conclusion. (Id. { 45.) 
  Credit One and Suluki largely dispute what Credit One did in its investigation. 
(Suluki Counter 56.1 at 18-36.) Ata minimum, plaintiff concedes that Credit One’s 
dispute agents wrote in Credit One’s account notes the ACDV code provided by the 
CRA, and the current address provided by the consumer in the ACDV. (id. at 20-21.) 
The dispute agent then checked for any name discrepancy, filled in the address to 
which the credit card was shipped, and verified that the address and telephone number 
used to open the account were linked to the card member in LexisNexis for a significant 
amount of time, as well as during the timeframe the application for the card was 
received. (Id.) Defendant's remaining contentions relating to its investigative process are 
outlined in its 56.1 Statement. (Credit One 56.1 {{[f 20-38.) 

information is requested: a copy of an identity theft report filed with your local police department (or other 
inw enforcement agency).” (Id, at 12.) It is undisputed that no identity theft report fitting that description 
has ever been provided by Suluki.

  The account balance was paid in full on or about August 5, 2020. (Id. { 47.) Credit 
One did not hear further from Suluki until this lawsuit was filed six months later. (Id.) 
  IV.     Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment Is Denied 
  Suluki seeks summary judgment that a) Credit One’s reporting was not accurate; b) 
Credit One failed to properly report the results of its investigation to the credit 
reporting agencies*; and c) Credit One’s investigation into Suluki’s disputes was 
unreasonable, The Court denies Suluki’s motion for summary judgment in its entirety. 
     a.  Credit One’s reporting was not inaccurate as a matter of law. 
     “A prerequisite for any FCRA claim is that the challenged credit information is 
incomplete or inaccurate.” Ostreicher v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., No. 19-CV-8175 (CS), 
2020 WL 6809059, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2020). “This order of proof makes sense: if 
there is no inaccuracy, then the reasonableness of the investigation is not in play. On the 
flip side, if there is an inaccuracy, to succeed, the plaintiff must establish that the 
investigation was unreasonable.” Gross v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 33 F.4th 1246, 1251 (9th Cir. 
2022), 
     Suluki asserts that there is no genuine dispute that Credit One’s reporting to the 
CRAs that the disputed account belongs to her was inaccurate. Credit One counters in 
its motion that “[b]ecause of the conflicting testimony and documentary evidence 
concerning accuracy, Credit One is not moving for summary judgment on that issue,” 
(Credit One MSJ at 11 n.4), and states in opposition to plaintiff's motion that this issue is 
not one of law, but is one of fact that must be determined by a jury. (Credit One Opp’n 
at 3.) 
     The Court finds that whether Credit One’s reporting was “inaccurate” — that is, 
whether Suluki’s mother opened the account without Suluki’s blessing — is a question of 
fact in genuine dispute that cannot be resolved at this stage. Almost all of the facts 
alleged by both parties are consistent with Suluki’s mother opening the account in 

6 Oddly, plaintiff seeks summary judgment on this claim pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b}(1)(C), which 
does not appear in her complaint. Section 1681s-2(b)(1)(E) does appear in the complaint, but neither party 
addresses that section in its briefing papers. Plaintiff cannot prevail on summary judgment on her section 
1681s-2(b)(1)(C) claim for this reason alone, but the Court also details below why she cannot prevail on 
the merits of this claim.

plaintiffs name.’ (See Suluki MSJ 2-3.) The dispute is whether plaintiff gave her mother 
permission to do so on her behalf. The only direct evidence to that effect are the directly 
conflicting statements from Suluki and her mother. 
     Contrary to Suluki’s assertion that “Credit One has no evidence to rebut [her] 
testimony,” (Suluki MSJ at 10-11), Credit One has produced a  call recording (ECF No. 
60-5) and deposition testimony (ECF No. 72-1) from Sultuki’s mother stating that Suluki 
authorized her to open the account on Suluki’s behalf. There is no reason for this Court 
to credit Suluki’s sworn statements over her mother’s, particularly when taking the 
facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. Moreover, Khadijah’s other 
daughter Taheerah testified that Khadijah helped her get a credit card with Credit One, 
and that her mother often supported Khalilah and Taheerah this way. (ECF No. 72-5, 
26:8-28:11.) “Because ‘the credibility of witnesses is exclusively for the determination by 
the jury,’ the Court is not able to resolve the witnesses’ conflicting accounts.” Garcia v. 
Dutchess Cnty., 43 F. Supp. 3d 281 (SHS), 292 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), aff'd in part, dismissed in 
part sub nom. Garcia v. Sistarenik, 603 F. App'x 61 (2d Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). 
     Plaintiff relies on Alabran v. Capital One Bank, No. CIV.A. 3:04CV935, 2005 WL 
3338663 (E.D. Va. Dec. 8, 2005) and Wood v. Credit One Bank, 277 F. Supp. 3d 821 (E.D. 
Va. 2017), in which the courts held as a matter of law that the furnishers’ reporting was 
inaccurate, but the facts in those cases differ from those here in critical ways. In Wood, 
the “identity thief” confessed that the card belonged to her, not the plaintiff. Wood 
“submitted an affidavit from his mother, Dyan Lollis, ‘certifying that the Credit One 
credit card was opened against the will of David Wood, but instead by Dyan Lollis,’ 
and stating that she ‘wish[ed] to have [it] transferred back to the rightful owner Dyan 
Lollis.’ (Lollis Aff. 1.)”. 277 F. Supp. 3d at 849. Even in the face of this, Credit One only 
offered testimony from its own employees saying, “there was nothing to indicate that it 
was not Mr. Wood who, in fact, opened the account”; that it was their “belief” that 
Wood applied for the card; and a police officer’s personal “belief” that Wood was trying 
to get out of his debt. fd. at 850. The court found these were “conclusory statements 

7 Credit One admitted at deposition that it is “more likely than not” that Suluki’s mother opened the 
account. (Suluki 56.1, ECF No. 66-2 at 70:10-15.) Credit One attempts to explain this by stating that at the 
time it made this admission at deposition, it had not received testimony from Suluki’s mother swearing 
to authorization by her daughter, (Credit One Opp’n at 3 n.2), but its statement at deposition is not 
inconsistent ~ it merely reflects the likelihood that Suluki’s mother opened the account, and that the only 
remaining question is whether she did so with Suluki’s permission.

including no facts on which a reasonable jury could return a verdict in Credit One's 
favor.” Id. In contrast, a jury in this case could rely on Suluki’s mother’s sworn firsthand 
testimony to return a verdict in Credit One’s favor. And in Alabran, the undisputed 
evidence showed that the plaintiff was “at most, only an authorized user of the credit 
card or cards involved and not liable for the subject  indebtedness.” Alabran, No. CIV.A. 
3:04CV935, 2005 WL 3338663, at *4. 
     “TW]hen the party against whom summary judgment is sought comes forth with 
affidavits or other material obtained through discovery that generates uncertainty as to 
the true state of any material fact, the procedural weapon of summary judgment is 
inappropriate. Indeed, it is the very purpose of the trial to establish which party's 
version of the contested circumstances best comports with reality.” Quinn v. Syracuse 
Model Neighborhood Corp., 613 F.2d 438, 445 (2d Cir. 1980). Credit One produced 
deposition testimony and call recordings creating a genuine dispute of material fact as 
to the accuracy of its reporting. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
Credit One, a reasonable jury could conclude Suluki gave her mother permission to 
open the account in Suluki’s name. This Court cannot find that Credit One’s reporting 
was inaccurate as a matter of law. 
     b.  There is no private right of action for a furnisher’s failure to report an account 
        as disputed to the credit reporting agencies. 
     15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b)(1)(C) requires a furnisher — here, Credit One — to “report 
the results of the investigation to the consumer reporting agency.” Suluki asserts that 
Credit One was obligated to report to the CRAs that, although it had done what it 
considered to be verification of the account, Suluki still disputed the account. 
     But in this circuit, the failure to note an account as disputed is a claim under 
section 1681s-2(a) rather than under section 1681s-2(b), and there is no private right of 
action to enforce violations of section 1681s-2(a). Specifically, under 15 U.S.C. § 1681s- 
2(a)(3), where a consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of information, the 
furnisher “may not furnish the information to any consumer reporting agency without 
notice that such information is disputed by the consumer.” However, the FCRA 
provides that section 1681s-2(a) “shall be enforced exclusively . . . by the Federal 
agencies and officials and the State officials identified in section 1681s of this title.” 15 
US.C. § 1681s-2(d). The Second Circuit has repeatedly affirmed that this precludes 
consumers from privately enforcing provisions of section 1681s-2(a). See Sprague v.

Salisbury Bank & Tr. Co., 969 F.3d 95, 98-99 (2d Cir. 2020) (“As the district court correctly 
concluded, the FCRA does not provide a private cause of action for violations of Section 
1681s-2(a).”); Longman v. Wachovia Bank, 702 F.3d 148, 151 (2d Cir. 2012) (per curiam). 
     Specifically addressing a claim essentially identical to Suluki’s, another court in 
the Southern District recently noted, “Were the Court to allow such a violation to 
proceed under the guise of a § 1681s-2(b) violation, it would create an end-run around 
the clear language of the statute and permit a private cause of action for conduct 
specifically enumerated under § 1681s-2(a).” Tescher v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 2022 WL. 
564048, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2022). Thus, despite the plaintiff's assertions in Tescher 
that the furnisher’s failure to mark the account as disputed was both “misleading and 
materially incomplete,” “to the extent that Plaintiff intend[ed] to proceed against 
Defendant on the theory that failing to mark his account as disputed and continuing to 
report it without that notation [we]re actionable . . . those theories [we]re dismissed as 
non-actionable duties imposed on furnishers by § 1681s-2(a).” Id. Although Suluki cites 
to out-of-circuit cases that appear to have ruled differently on this issue, the law in this 
Circuit is straightforward: there is no private right of action to enforce 15 U.S.C. § 1681s- 
2(a), and that is exactly what Suluki seeks to do here. 
     Suluki’s request for judgment that Credit One violated the FCRA by falsely 
reporting its investigation results to the CRAs is therefore denied, and since binding 
circuit precedent dictates that she cannot prevail against Credit One on this claim, this 
claim is dismissed. 
     c.  Suluki has not shown, as she must, that any alternative investigation would 
        have led Credit One to a different conclusion. 
     Finally, Suluki seeks a determination that Credit One’s investigation into her 
disputes was unreasonable as a matter of law. Credit One opposes this, and instead 
seeks a finding that no reasonable jury could conclude Credit One’s investigation was 
unreasonable. 
     Because this Court has held that Suluki cannot show that Credit One’s reporting 
was inaccurate as a matter of law, a reasonable jury could find that the information 
reported by Credit  One was accurate. In that case, Suluki would not be able to 
demonstrate that Credit One caused her harm, and the reasonableness of Credit One’s 
investigation would be moot. See Gross, 33 F.4th at 1251.

     But even assuming the information reported by Credit One was inaccurate, 
plaintiff cannot prevail as a matter of law because, even taking the facts in the light 
most favorable to her on the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, she has not 
shown that an alternative investigation would have led Credit One to a different 
conclusion. See supra Section V(a). 
     Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is thus denied in full. 
  V.     Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Is Granted 
     Credit One contends that whatever factual dispute remains as to the accuracy of 
its reporting, that fact is not material because its investigation was reasonable as a 
matter of law, and plaintiff has not shown that any reasonable investigation would have 
changed Credit One’s conclusion. (Credit One MSJ at 11-16.) The Court finds that 
whatever the reasonableness of Credit One’s investigation, no reasonable factfinder 
could find that plaintiff is entitled to damages under the FCRA, and grants Credit One's 
motion for summary judgment. 
     “Under § 1681n, a Defendant who willfully violates the FCRA is liable for ‘any 
actual damages sustained by the consumer as a  result of the failure or damages of not 
less than $100 and not more than $1,000, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees.” 
Frederick v. Cap. One Bank (USA), N.A., No. 14-CV-5460 (AJN), 2018 WL 1583289, at “10 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2018) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 168in{a)). “By contrast, pursuant to § 
16810, negligent violations of the FCRA entitle a plaintiff to collect actual damages, but 
not punitive damages.” Id. Plaintiff “bear[s] the burden of demonstrating the existence 
of a material factual dispute as to the existence of damages.” Id. (citation omitted). 
“Under a willful noncompliance theory, the plaintiff need not show actual damages and 
is entitled to statutory and punitive damages.” Severini v. Pennsylvania Higher Educ. 
Assistance Agency, No. 18-cv-2775, 2020 WL 1467396, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2020). 
        a)  Actual Damages 
     There remains a factual dispute about the adequacy of the steps taken by Credit 
One to investigate Suluki’s claims. But Credit One still prevails as a matter of law, 
because even where a defendant has violated 15 U.S.C. § 1681s—2(b) by failing to 
conduct a reasonable investigation of the disputed information, summary judgment in 
favor of the defendant is “still appropriate if no reasonable factfinder could find that 
Plaintiff is entitled to damages under the FCRA.” Ramirez v. Verizon Comme’ns, Inc., No. 

                                     10 

13-cv-6000, 2015 WL 917531, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2015); Frederick, No. 14-CV-5460, 
2018 WL 1583289, at *7. “In order to recover under a negligence theory, plaintiff must 
establish actual damages attributable to defendants’ unreasonable investigation.” Okocha 
v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., No. 08-cv-8650, 2010 WL 5122614, at *5 (5.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 
2010) (emphasis added). In other words, even if the inaccuracy of the reporting led to 
damages to the plaintiff, if there is “no genuine issue of material fact as to whether a 
reasonable investigation would have revealed that [defendant] reported inaccurate 
information,” then there is no causal connection between the unreasonableness of the 
defendant's investigation and the inaccuracy that caused the plaintiff damages, and the 
plaintiff cannot prevail against that defendant. Jackling v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A,, No. 15- 
cv-6148, 2019 WL 162743, at *5 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2019). 
     Although the Second Circuit has not explicitly agreed with this approach, other 
circuit courts have. See Chiang v. Verizon New Eng. Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 41 (1st Cir. 2010) 
(affirming the district court's finding that plaintiff was “required to present evidence of 
actual inaccuracies in his account that an alternative investigation might have 
uncovered”); Gross, 33 F.4th at 1252 (“Establishing an inaccuracy is not enough, 
however; [plaintiff] must also show that the inaccuracy was the product of an 
unreasonable investigation by [defendant].”); Felts v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 893 F.3d 
1305, 1313 (11th Cir. 2018) (“Regardless of the nature of the investigation a furnisher 
conducted, a plaintiff asserting a claim against a furnisher for failure to conduct a 
reasonable investigation cannot prevail on the claim without demonstrating that had the 
furnisher conducted a reasonable investigation, the result would have been 
different; i.e., that the furnisher would have discovered that the information it reported 
was inaccurate or incomplete, triggering the furnisher's obligation to correct the 
information. Absent that showing, a  plaintiffs claim against a farnisher necessarily 
fails, as the plaintiff would be unable to demonstrate any injury from the allegedly 
deficient investigation.”). Other circuits have also upheld a requirement in section 1681i 
cases against CRAs that plaintiffs identify information that a more extensive 
investigation would have revealed. See, e.g., Cushman v. Trans Union, 115 F.3d 220, 226 
(3d Cir. 1997) (“the decisive inquiry is whether [the CRA] could have determined that 
the accounts were opened fraudulently if it had reasonably investigated the 
matter’”); Cahlin v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 936 F.2d 1151, 1160 (11th Cir. 
1991) (“[A § 1681i(a)] claim is properly raised when a  particular credit report contains 

                                     11 

a factual deficiency or error that could have been remedied by uncovering additional 
facts that provide a more accurate representation about a particular entry.”). 
     Even taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Suluki has not 
presented any facts showing that, had Credit One taken any of the additional steps she 
urges, it would have come to a different conciusion. The evidence shows at most that 
Suluki’s mother opened the account in Suluki’s name. There is no alternative 
investigation that would have allowed Credit One to determine that Suluki did not give 
her mother permission to open the account, short of relying on a police or FIC report to 
that effect which Suluki never provided.’ For example, Suluki insists that if Credit One 
had checked the IP address from which the application was submitted, it would have 
learned that it was not Suluki who submitted it. (Suluki MSJ at 2.) But the IP address 
would have told Credit One nothing about whether Suluki gave her mother permission 
to do so. (Credit One Opp’n at 12-14,) In fact, Suluki worked with Khadijah at the school 
from which the application was submitted. (Id.) 
     No reasonable jury could find on these facts that Credit One had information 
available to it that, had Credit One taken additional steps to obtain that information, 
would have led it to conclude that Suluki did not authorize her mother to open the 
account on her behalf. This is the distinguishing factor between this case and others 
cited by plaintiff. In Wood, Credit One had evidence before it that ought to have led it to 
the correct conclusion: the identity thief submitted a written confession that Credit One 
needed only to accept. 277 F. Supp. 3d at 849. In Johnson v. MBNA Am. Bank, NA, 357 
F.3d 426, 432 (4th Cir, 2004), which plaintiff asserts is the “seminal decision” on 
reasonable investigations (Suluki MSJ at 15), the court noted that the original account 
application (which the bank no longer possessed) would have shown that the plaintiff 
was only an authorized user, and not a co-obligor, on the account. Thus, the court 
determined that the defendant could have verified that the plaintiff was not a co-obligor, 
had the defendant retained that document. Johnson, 357 F.3d at 432. 
     This case is distinguishable. Suluki has pointed to no one who can corroborate 
her testimony that her mother did not have her permission to open the account, nor has 

8 Credit One’s representative at deposition stated that he could not recall anything “other than a police 
report which would be investigated or an identity theft affidavit in the format that the FTC could make 
available .  .. that would cause Credit One to delete” an account in its report to a CRA, (Suluki Counter 
56.1, ECF No. 74-8 at 80:10-17.) 
                                     12 

she proffered any piece of evidence that would show she did not give that permission, 
if Credit One had only retained it or sought it out. Rather, this case is analogous to 
Chiang, in which the only evidence the plaintiff could identify that he alleged should 
have changed the furnisher’s conclusion was the plaintiff's “own telephone calls and 
letters complaining of the charges.” Chiang v. Verizon New England Inc., No. CIV.A.06- 
CV-12144 (DPW), 2009 WL 102707, at *11 (D. Mass. Jan. 13, 2009), aff'd, 595 F.3d 26 (1st 
Cir. 2010). This Court concludes, as the district court concluded in Chiang, that as “a 
furnisher is not required under the FCRA to rely solely on a consumer's allegations in 
the absence of other information that would cause a reasonable person to have 
substantial doubts about the accuracy of the consumer's credit report .. . [and] [a]s 
[plaintiff] cannot demonstrate that a reasonable investigation could have uncovered any 
such evidence,” plaintiff has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
the investigation satisfied section 1681s-2(b). 
     Because Suluki has not alleged any facts suggesting that any additional steps 
taken by Credit One would have yielded a  different result and prevented any damage 
she suffered, Suluki cannot prevail, and Credit One’s motion for summary judgment is 
granted. 
        b)  Willfulness 
     “Even if Plaintiff is not entitled to actual damages, he may still be entitled to 
punitive damages based on sufficient proof that [the defendant] willfully violated [] the 
FCRA.” Gorman v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., No. 07 CV 1846 (RPP), 2008 WL 4934047, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2008) (internal citation omitted). “[T]he mere failure to correct a 
plaintiff's inaccurate credit information, even after notification of the inaccuracy 
does not constitute a willful failure to comply with the FCRA.” Jenkins v. AmeriCredit 
Fin. Servs., Inc., No. 14-cv-5687, 2017 WL 1325369, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Feb, 14, 2017) (citation 
omitted). Willfulness can be found on either a knowing or reckless basis. ““[C]onscious 
disregard or deliberate and purposeful actions [are] necessary to make out a claim for 
willful noncompliance under the FCRA.”” Burns v. Bank of Am., 655 F. Supp. 2d 240, 252 
(S.D.N.Y. 2008), aff'd, 360 F. App’x 255 (2d Cir, 2010) (citing Casella v. Equifax Credit Info. 
Servs., 56 F.3d 469, 476 (2d Cir. 1995)). 
     Suluki has not sufficiently shown that Credit One was willful; she has set forth 
no evidence of “willful misrepresentations or concealments” that would satisfy this 
high burden. Burns, 655 F. Supp. 2d at 252 (quoting Pinner v. Schntidt, 805 F.2d 1258, 
                                     13 

1263 (5th Cir. 1987)). “[Bleyond Plaintiff's conclusory statements, [s]he furnishes no 
evidence that [] the Defendant] either intentionally misled [her] or acted in reckless 
disregard.” Frederick, No. 14-CV-5460 (AJN), 2018 WL 1583289, at *10. 
     Credit One’s motion for summary judgment is therefore granted in full. 
  VI.    Conclusion 
     The Court grants defendant’s motion for summary judgment and denies 
plaintiff's motion. Because plaintiff has not demonstrated a genuine dispute of material 
fact as to her entitlement to any remedy under the FCRA, this action is dismissed in its 
entirety.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
                    SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
Khalilah Suluki,                       ) 
            Plaintiff,
Credit One Bank, NA; et al.,             )              prem   nree  De awe 
            Defendants. 
eg _     ere) 
         PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL 
    AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT OF HER MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
      Plaintiff Kahlilah Suluki, by Counsel, requests the Court’s leave to file as supplemental 
authority to her Motion for Summary judgment the attached publication of the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, its Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-07 (Nov. 10, 2022). (Ex. 1.) 
For the reasons below, the Court should permit Plaintiff's filing. 
       I.     CFPB INTERPRETATIONS OF THE FCRA ARE PERSUASIVE AUTHORITY. 
      Since 2010, the CFPB has possessed the authority “to prescribe rules’ or ‘issue guidelines’ 
regarding the  FCRA.” Kidd v.  Thomson Reuters Corp.,  925 F.3d 99, 106 n.8 (2d Cir. 2019). Courts 
grant such guidance persuasive authority, id. at 106, and consider the CFPB and FTC “authoritative 
sources” in interpreting the FCRA. Henderson v. Trans Union, LLC, Civ. No. JAG-14-0679, 2017 
WL.1734036, at *2 (E.D. Va. May 2, 2017); Fernandez v. RentGrow, Inc.,  34) F.R.D.174, 193 
(D. Md. 2022) (citing Henderson with approval for this point). The Court should therefore have 
little  difficulty  concluding  that  the  CFPB  guidance  attached  is  appropriately  considered  as 
persuasive guidance in its analysis of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. 

                   Il.    THE ATTACHED, RECENT PUBLICATION 
          WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THE PARTIES BRIEFED SUMMARY 
              JUDGMENT, BUT THE COURT SHOULD CONSIDER IT ANYWAY. 
     The CFPB issued the publication Plaintiff seeks to include in the record on November 10. 
2022, more than five months after summary-judgment briefing closed. (See ECF 82, filed May 25, 
2022.) It therefore was not available at the time the Parties were briefing both sides’ summary- 
judgment motions. Since the Court has not yet issued its ruling on either motion, it should consider 
this recent interpretation by the CFPB. 
     The CFPB opinion is relevant because it discusses the reasonableness of investigations of 
disputes. (See Ex. 1.) The reasonableness of Credit One’s investigations into Plaintiffs disputes 
of its reporting of an account as belonging to her is the centerpiece of both motions for summary 
judgment,  so this recent opinion by the CFPB  is  unquestionably relevant.  The Court should 
therefore permit Plaintiff to file it and should make it part of the Court’s analysis of the pending 
motions. 
                              III.  | CONCLUSION. 
     For the foregoing reasons, the Court should permit Plaintiff to file the attached Exhibit 1 
as persuasive authority for her Motion for Summary Judgment. The opinion is relevant to the 
Court’s analysis, was unavailable at the time the Parties briefed summary judgment, and should 
therefore be part of the record here.
