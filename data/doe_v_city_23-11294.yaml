outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== John Doe, Jane Doe, and James Doe (Plaintiffs, Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Fourteenth Amendment claims against the BPD and DCF defendants because they plausibly alleged liability under the state-created danger doctrine.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court should not have dismissed all of their claims against the DCF defendants sua sponte, without giving them an opportunity to be heard.

  3. Appellants argued that their Fourteenth Amendment claims against the City of Boston should have survived because they were injured by the City''s custom of mishandling citizen complaints against police officers.

  4. Appellants claimed that the district court erred in dismissing their § 1985 claims on the basis that they are not members of a protected class, and urged the court to recognize a new protected class of ''victims of BPD''s internal cover-up of BPD misconduct in the 1990s.'''
