                         ORDER                                       
     In its November 4, 2021 Order, the Court directed the Clerk of the court to: 
“(1) enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on its breach of contract claim (to the extent that claim is 
based on Teytel’s limited use of the outputs of Defendants’ testing of ACE) and to award 
Plaintiff damages on that claim in the nominal amount of $1, (2) enter judgment in favor of 
Defendants as to the remainder of Plaintiff’s claims and as to Defendants’ counterclaim for fees 
and costs under the parties’ Non-Disclosure Agreement,[1] and (3) close the case.”  (Docket 
entry no. 464 at 6.)  Following the Second Circuit’s June 30, 2025 mandate affirming the Court’s 
entry of judgment, (docket entry no. 520), Defendants submitted a letter proposing a highly 
streamlined approach to their anticipated application for fees and costs, (docket entry no. 521).  
According to Defendants, “defense counsel’s time spans nearly 18,000 individual time entries 
(comprising more than 750 printed pages) which, if Defendants were to file an entry-by-entry fee 

1    The Non-Disclosure Agreement provides that “the prevailing party shall be entitled to 
recover all court costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys’ fees, in addition to any other 
relief to which it may be entitled.”  (Docket entry no. 520 at 7.)   
application, would require redaction for attorney-client privilege.”  (Docket entry no. 521 at 2.)  
In an effort to avoid the significant time and resources of reviewing each individual time entry, 
Defendants propose “to provide the Court with a quarter-by-quarter summary setting out the 
timekeepers, hours, and expenses incurred per quarter throughout the pendency of this litigation, 
as well as a summary of the case events that took place in that quarter (e.g., preparation of expert 

reports, filing motion for summary judgment).”  (Id.)  Plaintiff objects to Defendants’ proposal.  
(Docket entry no. 525.)  The Court has carefully considered the parties’ submissions (docket 
entry nos. 521, 525, 527) and, as explained below, Defendants’ proposal is rejected, but the 
Court will permit Defendants to streamline their application in important respects.  
     “[T]he party seeking a fee ‘bears the burden of showing the reasonableness of the 
fee by providing definite information regarding the way in which time was spent[.]’”2  Major 
League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Corporacion de Television y Microonda Rafa, S.A., No. 19-CV-
8669-MKV-GWG, 2021 WL 56904, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 7, 2021) (quoting Flemming v. 
Barnwell Nursing Home & Health Facilities, Inc., 865 N.Y.S.2d 706, 708 (App. Div., 3d Dep’t 


2    The parties appear to agree that this dispute is governed by the rule set forth in New York 
State Association for Retarded Child., Inc. v. Carey, that “[a]ll applications for attorney’s 
fees . . . should normally be disallowed unless accompanied by contemporaneous time 
records indicating, for each attorney, the date, the hours expended, and the nature of the 
work done.”  Scott v. City of New York, 626 F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting New 
York State Ass’n for Retarded Child., Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1154 (2d Cir. 
1983))); (see docket entry no. 525 at 2; docket entry no. 527 at 3-4).  The parties are not 
quite right in this regard.  Where, as here, the entitlement to attorney’s fees arises from a 
contract or state common law rather than a federal statute, New York courts do not 
invariably require contemporaneous daily time records as a foundation for the 
application.  See Marion S. Mishkin L. Off. v. Lopalo, 767 F.3d 144, 147-48 (2d Cir. 
2014) (“[I]n cases in which the right to attorneys’ fees is governed by state law, New 
York’s more liberal rule allowing reconstructed records should apply.”).  The distinction 
is of no moment in this case, however, because there appears to be no doubt that 
Defendants have contemporaneous time records.  The issue here is the extent to which 
the full content and format of those records must be disclosed in connection with the 
application.                                                         
2008)); see also UMB Bank, Nat’l Ass’n v. Bluestone Coke, LLC, 2021 WL 3292519, at *5 n.4 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2021); Crowhurst v. Szczucki, No. 16-CV-182-BAF-GWG, 2019 WL 
6122645, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2019), report and recommendation adopted, No. 16-CV-
0182-JGK, 2020 WL 133509 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 2020); PriMed Pharms. LLC v. Starr Indem. & 
Liab. Co., No. 21-CV-1025-SLC, 2024 WL 283463, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2024).  Under this 

standard, a quarter-by-quarter summary, particularly one that refers only to case events and not 
the nature of the work done, is insufficiently detailed to enable the Court to review, as well as 
enable the Plaintiff to litigate if necessary, the reasonableness of the fees Defendants seek.  See 
Major League Baseball, 2021 WL 56904 at *5 (finding “Fee Summary Charts show[ing] the 
hours expended by each attorney, with blocks generally describing the work that was done, the 
dates over which the work was done, and the total fees associated with those hours” to be 
insufficiently detailed); Crowhurst, 2019 WL 6122645, at *6 (finding, a “Fee Chart” where 
“entries cover periods of multiple days, with a single time entry and a description that lumps 
together multiple tasks” to be insufficiently detailed); Bhungalia Family, LLC v. Agarwal, 317 F. 

Supp. 3d 727, 742 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (“[C]ounsel’s extensive use of block billing . . . [hindered 
the] Court’s ability to understand how much time was devoted to particular tasks, so as to 
determine whether that time was reasonably spent.”).                      
     Defendants’ concern regarding the redaction of attorney-client privilege (and 
work product) information is, however, well taken.  A party entitled to recover attorneys’ fees is 
not required as a blanket matter to waive privilege and work product claims.  See, e.g., Alvarez 
v. Fine Craftsman Grp., LLC, 2024 WL 3730569, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 6, 2024) (permitting 
redactions related to privilege in fee application); Syntel Sterling Best Shores Mauritius Ltd. v. 
TriZetto Grp., Inc., 2024 WL 1116090, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2024) (permitting redactions 
related to trade secrets in fee application).  A balance must be struck between the transaction 
costs of line-by-line redactions of original billing records and the insights to be gained from 
seeing the precise location of the redactions.  That said, Defendants’ request to proceed solely in 
the summary fashion that they have proposed, describing only case events rather than tasks 
performed and merely totaling hours and fees for months-long periods of time, is denied.   

     Instead, Defendants are directed to produce daily summaries of the time and 
expenses for which they seek to recover.  For each day, the summary shall present, for each 
timekeeper, the total time, billing rate, name, and a description of work performed.  Days 
reflecting the billing of expenses must identify the nature and amount of expense disbursements  
for which recovery is sought.  If the work descriptions omit the description of particular tasks or 
topics to protect privilege or work product claims, a note shall be included in the daily summary 
to that effect, identifying the basis for the claim (work product or attorney-client) and the type of 
work omitted from the summary description (e.g., meeting, memo, research topic). 
     Defendants are also encouraged to provide a quarter-by-quarter summary of work, 

timekeepers, and hours to facilitate review, including, if feasible, a category-by-category 
breakdown of the fees they seek.  Such categories may include the major phases of the case (e.g., 
pleadings, fact discovery, expert discovery, summary judgment, appeal), as well as 
sub-categories within those major categories (e.g., document requests, document review, 
interrogatories within the fact discovery category).                      
     In accordance with the Court’s order at Docket Entry No. 529, Defendants’ 
application must be filed within 45 days after the date of this Order.  Docket Entry No. 521 is 
resolved.

Re. Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. et al, 04 Civ. 3531 (LTS) (SLC) 
Dear Chief Judge Swain:                                                   
   We represent Plaintiff Advanced Analytics, Inc. (Plaintiff, or “AAI”) in the above-
captioned matter. We respectfully submit this letter pursuant to the Court’s July 11, 2025 Order 
(ECF No. 522), which directed Plaintiff to respond to Defendants’ request concerning their 
anticipated application for attorneys’ fees.                              
   Defendants’ request directly contradicts the well-established requirements for attorney 
fee applications in the Second Circuit, particularly the standard articulated in N.Y. State Ass’n for 
Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1148 (2d Cir. 1983), and also conflicts with the 
Court’s prior orders.                                                     
1.Defendants’ Request Fails to Acknowledge “Reasonable” Attorneys’ Fees   
Defendants request inexplicitly omits a critical requirement that governs any application for 
attorneys’ fees in this case—namely, that only reasonable fees may be awarded. 
This critical reasonable requirement is expressly set forth in Paragraph 21 of the governing Non-
Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”): “reasonable attorneys’ fees”. That language was quoted and 
reaffirmed by the Court in its November 4, 2021 Order (ECF No. 464), where the Court 
particularily noted that [Defendants’ admitted breach of the NDA] may affect the amount of 
‘reasonable’ fees the Court ultimately awards.” Id, n.2.                  
This requirement is not only contractual, but also mandated by settled law. The Supreme Court 
has held that courts must calculate a “lodestar” figure to determine reasonable attorney’s fees. 
See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983); Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 888 
(1984).The Blum Court emphasized that “reasonable fees” are to be determined “according to the 
prevailing market rates in the relevant community”—not according to a party’s internal costs of 
legal services.                                                           
2. The Controlling Standard Requires Detailed, Contemporaneous Billing Records Without 
Exception for Administrative Convenience                                  
The Second Circuit unequivocally reaffirmed that Carey standard and requires all applications 
for attorneys’ fees to be supported by contemporaneous time records that: “specify, for each 
attorney, the date, the hours expended, and the nature of the work done.” Defendants must first 
demonstrate that the fees they seek are reasonable under the governing legal and contractual 
standards. Their request fails to do so.                                  
This standard is not discretionary. The Carey standard held that these records are essential to 
enable the court to assess the reasonableness of time claimed, the necessity of the work 
performed, and the amount of time reasonably required. The rule is one of substance, not 
form. It ensures meaningful judicial review and protects the integrity of fee awards. This 
requirement has been strictly reaffirmed by the Second Circuit in Scott v. City of New York, 626 
F.3d 130, 133 (2d Cir. 2010) (“Scott I”) and again in Scott v. City of New York, 643 F.3d 56 (2d 
Cir. 2011) (“Scott II”).                                                  
Together, Carey and its reaffirmation in Scott v. City of New York, 626 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2010) 
(“Scott I”) and 643 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2011) (“Scott II”), establish a strict, bright-line rule: fee 
applicants must submit detailed contemporaneous time records specifying, for each attorney, the 
date, the hours expended, and the nature of the work performed. No substitute format—such as 
quarterly summaries, aggregated totals, or generalized descriptions—is acceptable. Exceptions to 
this requirement are “minimal and limited in scope,” permitted only under “truly unusual 
circumstances beyond the applying attorney’s control,” not for ordinary administrative burdens 
like the volume of records or the effort to redact privileged material. Scott I expressly rejected 
those very excuses, which are identical to the ones Defendants now offer. Moreover, if a district 
court departs from this mandate, it must offer a specific, detailed justification; otherwise, the fee 
award will be vacated on appeal.                                          
Defendants’ proposal to submit “quarter-by-quarter summaries” fails entirely to meet this 
rigorous standard and would make meaningful judicial review of fee reasonableness impossible 
3. Defendants’ Misconduct and Resources Make Their Request Particularly Improper 
   Defendants’ request to bypass the Carey standard is especially improper given their 
litigation conduct over the past two decades. As this Court and the Second Circuit are aware, 
Defendants have repeatedly prolonged litigation through concealment, obstruction, and 
procedural gamesmanship. They resisted producing critical documents—such as the sequences 
used by TYB and the Sequence Record—that the Court later ruled must be disclosed, and which 
Plaintiff was forced to pursue at great cost. Then they produced spoliated and fabricated records. 
Defendants now seek attorneys’ fees for that very conduct, while attempting to conceal the 
details of the work they performed. This is contrary to both the NDA and settled precedent, 
which prohibit awarding fees for unreasonable, obstructive, or unlawful litigation conduct. 
   Defendants attempt to justify their request for a waiver of the Carey/Scott standard by 
citing the supposed “burden” of preparing and redacting billing records spanning “18,000 time 
entries” and over 750 pages. But this argument fails on both factual and legal grounds. 
Defendants are among the largest and most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, 
represented throughout this litigation by highly resourced, top-tier law firms. It is not credible for 
them to claim that assembling a standard fee application imposes an undue burden. The Carey 
standard applies equally to small nonprofit litigants and to billion-dollar entities—indeed, that is 
its purpose. If compliance were excused based on administrative inconvenience, the entire 
framework for assessing “reasonable” fees would collapse.                 
   If Defendants now find it administratively burdensome to provide a full accounting of 
their billing, that burden is of their own making. Moreover, their claim of redaction burden is 
both overblown and suspicious. Defendants have not explained why attorney-client privileged 
content must be interwoven throughout their billing narratives, nor why summaries would avoid 
that concern but detailed time entries would not. Their argument raises further concern that they 
may seek to conceal improper entries—such as possible undisclosed payments to conflicted 
individuals—or time billed for misconduct, including resisting discovery of “apparently 
relevant” evidence. No redaction is appropriate where the law requires transparency, and Carey 
mandates precisely that.                                                  
   In light of this history, Plaintiff expressly reserves all rights under the laws and the NDA 
to seek affirmative relief, including reimbursement for fees caused by Defendants’ misconduct. 
However, Plaintiff does not presently request any such relief or a hearing at this time. This letter 
responds only to the Court’s request for position on Defendants’ fee proposal.1  
   Plaintiff therefore requests that the Court deny Defendants' request for a waiver of 
the Carey standard and direct Defendants to provide a fee application supported by full, 
unredacted, contemporaneous time records specifying the date, hours expended, and the nature 
 1 Moreover, the determination of "reasonable" fees is further complicated by Defendants' misconduct in this
litigation. The 2009 R&R (2009 WL 7133660 (S.D.N.Y.)), confirmed “a cause of action for a breach of contract
occurs at the time of the breach” and Defendants' admitted breach, which triggered Paragraph 19 of the parties'
NDA, which provides: "In any event of actual or potential breach involving Confidential Software Information,
the compensation from the Receiving Party shall be no less than the actual or potential damage caused to the
Disclosing Party." This provision reinforces Plaintiff's entitlement to compensation for Defendants' breach,
including potentially attorney fees incurred to bring this action.      
 The subsequent 2019 R&R and related orders were procured through conspiracy and fraud. This sequence of
events severely impact the fairness of awarding Defendants fees as "prevailing parties" and necessitates strict
scrutiny of their fee application. It makes the need for a precise determination of "reasonable" fees, based on
strict adherence to Carey, even more imperative.                        
 Defendants’ legal work was not merely excessive or unreasonable—it was rooted in a 3-Level Fraud that has
obstructed this litigation from ever being resolved on the merits. As part of their 3-Pronged Scheme (Level 2
Fraud), Defendants persistently resisted the production of sequences and the sequence record—information this
Court later found to be “apparently relevant” and ordered to be produced. See Chief  Judge Swain’s Order of
Nov. 22, 2010 (2010 WL 4780772 (S.D.N.Y.). Awarding attorneys’ fees for work that was not only
unreasonable but unlawful from their victim would constitute manifest injustice.
    of the work done by each attorney, in accordance with Second Circuit precedent and the Court's 
    own rulings.                                                              

                                  Respectfully submitted,                     
                                  /s/ Kevin K. Tung

    cc: All counsel of record (via ECF)                                       











The parties are directed to meet and confer to see if they are able to reach a resolution without the Court’s 
intervention.  If the parties are not able to reach a resolution, Defendants are directed to submit a reply by August 1, 
2025.  The Court also notes that caselaw suggests that “[a] prevailing party has the right to recover reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in preparing a successful motion for attorneys’ fees.”  Ognibene v. Parkes, No. 
08-CV-1335-LTS-FM, 2014 WL 3610947, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 22, 2014) (citing cases).  The Court merely notes the 
existence of such authority for the benefit of the parties’ meet and confer; the Court does not decide whether this 
authority applies here.  DE # 525 is resolved.

                    MEMORANDUM ORDER                                 
     Before the Court are Plaintiff’s objections (docket entry no. 515 (“Pl. Objs.”)), 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72, to Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave’s October 31, 
2023, Order (docket entry no. 514 (“October 31 Order”)).  The October 31 Order denied 
reconsideration of an earlier order issued by Judge Cave that denied Plaintiff’s two motions 
concerning the state of the record underlying its pending appeal to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit.  (Docket entry no. 512 (“October 19 Order”).)  The Court has 
also received a letter from Defendants indicating that, should the Court not deny Plaintiff’s 
objections, they intend to file their opposition by November 28, 2023.  (Docket entry no. 516.)  
The Court has reviewed carefully the parties’ submissions in connection with the Plaintiff’s 
requested relief, as well as Judge Cave’s corresponding orders and, for the following reasons, 
overrules Plaintiff’s objections.  The October 31 Order will stand.       
                       DISCUSSION                                    
     The Court assumes familiarity with the facts of this almost twenty-year-old case, 
which are set forth in the Court’s numerous decisions and orders.  As relevant here, Plaintiff 
objects to Judge Cave’s October 31 Order, which denied Plaintiff’s “Motion for 

Reconsideration” of Judge Cave’s October 19 Order denying Plaintiff’s two motions to, inter 
alia, “complete the record” for its pending appeal, have the Court approve its “statement of 
evidence,” and sanction Defendants.  (See docket entry nos. 503 and 507.)  Although Plaintiff 
did not cite Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) in seeking what it invariably called 
“reconsideration” of the October 19 Order, Judge Cave construed Plaintiff’s challenge as one 
sounding in Rule 60(b).  (October 31 Order at 2 n.2.)                     
     When a party objects to a magistrate judge’s non-dispositive order, the district 
court must review the objections and “modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly 
erroneous or is contrary to law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).  A decision is 
clearly erroneous where “the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and 

firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.”  Gualandi v. Adams, 385 F.3d 236, 240 (2d 
Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  An order is “contrary to law when it 
fails to apply or misapplies relevant statutes, case law or rules of procedure.”  Knitting Fever, 
Inc. v. Coats Holding Ltd., No. 05-CV-1065-DRH-MLO, 2005 WL 3050299, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Nov. 14, 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  This standard of review is 
“highly deferential,” as “magistrate judges are afforded broad discretion in resolving 
nondispositive disputes and reversal is appropriate only if their discretion is abused.”  Thai Lao 
Lignite (Thailand) Co. v. Gov’t of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 924 F. Supp. 2d 508, 511-
12 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The fact that “reasonable 
minds may differ on the wisdom of granting [a party’s] motion is not sufficient to overturn a 
magistrate judge’s decision.”  Edmonds v. Seavey, No. 08-CV-5646-HB, 2009 WL 2150971, at 
*2 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 20, 2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
     The October 31 Order is neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.  It 

correctly applied the reconsideration standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and 
found that “Plaintiff has not identified any ‘controlling decisions or data that the court 
overlooked,’ and has not shown any ‘exceptional circumstances’ that warrant this extraordinary 
relief.”  (October 31 Order at 3 (quoting Vasquez v. Cty. of Rockland, No. 13-CV-5632-SLC, 
2020 WL 8079814, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 2020), aff’d, 2021 WL 5286676 (2d Cir. Nov. 15, 
2021)).)  Instead, in seeking reconsideration, Plaintiff repeated arguments that Judge Cave had 
already considered and rejected in her October 19 Order, which is an improper use of Rule 60.  
See, e.g., Gonzales v. Nat’l Westminster Bank PLC, No. 11-CV-1435-LAP, 2013 WL 6978874, 
at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 2023) (citing Associated Press v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 395 F. Supp. 2d 
17, 19-20 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)).                                               

     The Court notes that almost the entirety of Plaintiff’s 33-page objections brief is 
directed at Judge Cave’s earlier, October 19 Order, even as the brief itself is styled as an 
objection to Judge Cave’s October 31 Order.  (See generally Pl. Objs.)  Whether inadvertently or 
purposefully, Plaintiff did not object to the October 19 Order; instead, it sought reconsideration, 
and now objects to the denial thereof.  That course of action bars Plaintiff from challenging the 
October 19 Order.  The failure to object to the October 19 Order within the 14-day time period 
allowed under Rule 72(a) “forfeits the right to any further review of that decision, either by the 
district court or on appeal.”  Kilcullen v. New York State Dep’t of Transp., 55 F. App'x 583, 585 
(2d Cir. 2003) (citing Spence v. Maryland Cas Co., 995 F.2d 1147, 1155 (2d Cir. 1993)); see also 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).  Therefore, the Court need not, and does not, address Plaintiff’s objections 
to the October 19 Order.                                                  
                       CONCLUSION                                    
     For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s objections to Judge Cave’s October 31 

Order are overruled, and the October 31 Order will stand.  This Memorandum Order resolves 
docket entry no. 515.

SARAH L. CAVE, United States Magistrate Judge.                            

Before  the  Court  is  Plaintiff’s  motion  (ECF  No.  513  (the  “Motion”))  seeking 
reconsideration of the Court’s October 19, 2023 Order (ECF No. 512 (the “Order”)), which denied 
its two motions concerning the state of the record underlying its pending appeal to the United 
States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit.    (ECF   Nos. 503;  505  (together,  the 
“Prior Motions”)).  For the reasons set forth below, the Motion is DENIED. 
Local  Civil  Rule  6.3  and  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  60(b)  govern  motions  for 
reconsideration.  Local Civil Rule 6.3 specifies timing, giving the moving party fourteen days after 
an entry of judgment to file a motion for reconsideration.  See Local Civ. R. 6.3.  Rule 60(b) 
provides:                                                                 
On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative 
from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:  (1) mistake, 
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that, 
with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a 
new trial  under  Rule  59(b);  (3)  fraud  (whether  previously  called  intrinsic  or 
extrinsic),  misrepresentation,  or  misconduct  by  an  opposing  party;  (4)  the 
judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is 
based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it 
prospectively is no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief. 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).1                                                   

Rule 60(b) affords “‘extraordinary judicial relief’” that can be granted “only upon a 
showing of exceptional circumstances.”  Farrar v. Danziger, No. 21-2324-cv, 2022 WL 5239542, 
at *1 (2d Cir. Oct. 6, 2022) (summary order) (quoting Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 61 
(2d Cir. 1986)).  The reconsideration standard “is strict,” and reconsideration is generally only 
granted upon a showing of “controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked—matters, in 
other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.”  
Cho v. Blackberry Ltd., 991 F.3d 155, 170 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting Van Buskirk v. United Grp. of 

Cos., Inc., 935 F.3d 49, 54 (2d Cir. 2019)).                              
A motion for reconsideration is not “an occasion for repeating old arguments previously 
rejected  nor  an  opportunity  for  making  new  arguments  that  could  have  been  previously 
advanced.”  B.C. v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 21 Civ 2840 (ER), 2023 WL 2301424, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Mar.  1,  2023)  (quoting  Associated  Press  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Def.,  395  F.  Supp.  2d  17,  19 
(S.D.N.Y. 2005)).  It is not a way to “‘advance new facts, issues or arguments not previously 

presented to the Court.’”  Id. (quoting Polsby v. St. Martin’s Press, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 960 (MBM), 
2000 WL 98057, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2000)).  The “moving party bears the burden of proof.”  
Id. (quoting Freedom, N.Y., Inc. v. United States, 438 F. Supp. 2d 457, 462 (S.D.N.Y. 2006)).  The 
decision to grant or deny a motion for reconsideration is “within ‘the sound discretion of the 
district court.’”  Id. (quoting Aczel v. Labonia, 584 F.3d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 2009)). 



1 While the Motion does not cite to Rule 60 (see ECF No. 513), the Court construes the Motion as having 
been brought under both Local Civil Rule 6.3 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). 
 Here,  Plaintiff  has  not  identified  any  “controlling  decisions  or  data  that  the  court 
overlooked,” and has not shown any “exceptional circumstances” that warrant this extraordinary 
relief.  Vasquez v. Cty. of Rockland, No. 13 Civ. 5632 (SLC), 2020 WL 8079814, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 15, 2020), affirmed by, 2021 WL 5286676 (2d Cir. Nov. 15, 2021).  Rather, Plaintiff repeats 
arguments the Court already considered and rejected in the Order, which is not a valid ground 
for reconsideration.  See, e.g., Gonzales v. Nat’l Westminster Bank PLC, No. 11 Civ. 1435 (LAP), 
2013  WL 6978874,  at  *4  (S.D.N.Y.  Nov.  18,  2023)  (citing Associated  Press,  395  F.  Supp.  2d 
at 19-20).  Accordingly, the Motion is DENIED. 
 The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close ECF No. 513.

SARAH L. CAVE, United States Magistrate Judge.                            

Before the Court are two motions filed by Plaintiff concerning the current state of the 
record (the “Record”) underlying its pending appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit.  See Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts., Inc., No. 22-1718 (2d Cir. 
filed Aug. 8, 2022) (the “Appeal”).  The first motion is brought under Federal Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (“FRAP”) 10(a), 10(e)(1)(2)(A)-(B), 11(b)(2)(A), and 30(a); the Individual Practices of 
Chief Judge Laura Taylor Swain; and the Court’s inherent power, and asks the Court, inter alia, to 
supplement the Record on Appeal and compel Defendants to cooperate with Plaintiff’s efforts to 
complete the Record.  (ECF No. 503 (the “First Motion”)).  Defendants filed an opposition to the 
First Motion in which they argue, inter alia, that the motion is procedurally improper, without 
merit,  and foreclosed  by  the  Second  Circuit’s decision  regarding  the state of the  Record.  
(ECF No. 505 at 6–22).  The second motion is brought under FRAP 10(b)(2) and 10(c); New York 
Judiciary Law § 487; New York Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3(a)(1), 3.4, 4.1, and 9.4; and the 
Court’s inherent power, and asks the Court, inter alia, to approve its “statement of evidence” and 
to sanction Defendants for “civil conspiracy,” fraud, and deception of the Court.  (ECF No. 507 
(the “Second Motion,” with the First Motion, the “Motions”)).  On October 16, 2023, on receipt 
and review of the Second Motion, the Court ordered that Defendants need not respond to the 
Second Motion, and that the Court would rule on the Motions together in due course.  (ECF No. 

510).  Plaintiff thereafter filed a reply to the First Motion.  (ECF No. 511).1 
The Motions are DENIED.  Plaintiff recently raised the issues underlying the Motions with 
the Second Circuit, where it moved to “complete the record” under FRAP 10(a), 10(e)(2)-(3), 
11(b)(2)(A), 27, and 30; the Second Circuit’s Local Rules; and the Second Circuit’s “inherent 
powers.”  Appeal, Doc. No. 105 at 2.  On August 22, 2023, the Second Circuit denied Plaintiff’s 


1 The Court assumes the reader’s familiarity with the background of this case and references only the facts 
and procedural history necessary to explain this Opinion.  The lengthy procedural history of this case going 
back nearly 20 years is amply set forth in the Court’s many decisions and orders.  See, e.g., Advanced

1195220 (S.D.N.Y. May 2, 2006).  (See ECF Nos. 50, 59, 82, 110, 112, 124, 174, 214, 235, 248, 256, 259, 
275, 339–40, 387, 410, 438, 461, 464, 497, 500).                          
“motion to complete the record and for sanctions.”  Appeal, Doc. No. 123 at 1.  Although denying 
Defendants’ motion to impose a leave-to-file sanction against Plaintiff—after Plaintiff filed 16 
letters without yet having filed its opening brief (see Appeal, Doc. Nos. 73 at 3; 105 at 5)—the 

Second Circuit declined to “entertain any further motions or other communications about the 
completion of the record or appendix” and “will not require the parties to make further attempts 
to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 30(b)(1).”  Appeal, Doc. No. 123 at 1 (the 
“August  22, 2023  Order”).    The Second  Circuit  also  directed that  “any  outstanding  issues 
concerning the record must be raised in the parties’ briefs, which will be addressed by the merits 

panel.  If Appellees have any issue with Appellant’s appendix, they may file a supplemental 
appendix or refer to any parts of the record they deem relevant and address the issue in their 
brief. . . . Appellant may address in a reply brief any issues concerning Appellees’ supplemental 
appendix or their use of the record.”  Id. at 2.                          
Despite the Second Circuit’s ruling in the August 22, 2023 Order, Plaintiff nevertheless 
seeks similar relief in this Court—filing the First Motion just over one month after the Second 

Circuit denied its request for relief—and essentially asks this Court to do what the Second Circuit 
would not.  (See ECF No. 503).  Plaintiff offers no compelling reason for the Court to do so.  The 
Second Circuit expressly forbade future motions pertaining to the Record and relieved the parties 
of any obligation to agree on the contents of the appendix.  Appeal, Doc. No. 123 at 1.  The Second 
Circuit also provided Plaintiff, if it believed the record was deficient, a path to raise those issues 
in its brief in the Appeal.  In light of the Second Circuit’s decision addressing the state of the 

Record  and holding  that  the  path  forward is for  the parties to  raise any  issues  with  the 
completeness of the Record in their appellate briefs, this Court is not in a position to direct 
otherwise.                                                                
To the extent that the Motions also ask the Court to revisit confidentiality designations of 

certain materials or the sealing status of Court filings dating back to 2004 (ECF No. 503 at 14), 
those requests have either been rejected by the Court, or are years late.  See Advanced Analytics, 
Inc. v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts, Inc., No. 04 Civ. 3531 (LTS) (HBP), 2013 WL 489061, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Feb. 8, 2013) (overruling Plaintiff’s objections to Judge Pitman’s Order sustaining Defendants’ 
designation of certain materials as “highly confidential”); Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup 

Glob. Mkts, Inc., No. 04 Civ. 3531 (LTS) (HBP), 2012 WL 7037319, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2012) 
(denying Plaintiff’s application to strike Defendants’ designation of certain materials as “highly 
confidential” and denying Plaintiff’s motion to reconsider prior decisions denying its applications 
to strike confidentiality designations).  (See ECF Nos. 30 (2006 Order denying application to strike 
“highly confidential” designations); 312 (2019 Order denying application to amend protecting 
order and partially granting Defendants’ motion to seal certain documents)).  Moreover, as 

noted, Plaintiff litigated this issue unsuccessfully in the Second Circuit over the past few months, 
including with respect to Plaintiff’s request under FRAP 10(c) to add a “statement of evidence” 
to the Record in place of transcripts that were not docketed.  See Appeal, Doc. Nos. 105 at 6 
(Plaintiff’s motion to “complete the record,” arguing that “all judicial documents should be 
unsealed according to controlling authorities”), 21–26 (Plaintiff’s arguments concerning the 
“statement of evidence”); 123 (denying Plaintiff’s motion to complete the record).2  The Court 


2 Even if the Second Circuit had not ruled that it would not entertain further applications regarding the 
Record and directed the parties to include any issues concerning the Record in their appellate briefs 
(supra), the Court would not approve under FRAP 10(c) the “statement of evidence” submitted by Plaintiff 
also agrees with  Defendants that, to the extent Plaintiff seeks to add documents to the case 
docket that were not filed in this case or were affirmatively stricken by the Court, such materials 
should not form a part of the Record and the relief requested would exceed that permitted under 
FRAP 10(e).  (See ECF No. 505 at 12-16).  See generally Robinson v. Sanctuary Rec. Grps., Ltd., 589 
F. Supp. 2d 273, 275 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (noting purpose of Rule 10(e) “to correct omissions from— 
or  misstatements  in—the  record  on  appeal,  not to  introduce  new evidence  in the  court of 
appeals”) (citation omitted). 
 Accordingly, the Motions are DENIED, as is Plaintiff’s related request for sanctions. 
 The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close ECF Nos. 503 and 507.

-------------------------------------------------------x                  

                          ORDER                                       

      The Court has received a letter motion filed by Advanced Analytics, Inc. 
(“Plaintiff”) seeking reconsideration and relief from the Court’s Order dated July 7, 2022 (docket 
entry no. 497).  That Order denied an earlier motion for reconsideration (docket entry no. 467) 
and a motion to take judicial notice of certain documents and facts (docket entry no. 479), both 
of which sought relief from the Court’s Judgment entered on November 5, 2021 (docket entry 
no. 465), and related orders.  The Court has reviewed carefully Plaintiff’s arguments and 
construes them as invoking Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b)(1), (3), and (6).  
For the following reasons, the motion is denied.                          
      Plaintiff falters at the outset.  The instant motion was filed as a letter, in 
contravention of S.D.N.Y. Local Civil Rules 6.3 and 7.1, and, for that reason alone, denial is 
warranted.  But requiring refiling of the motion to comport with this district’s local rules would 
not cure its substantive insufficiency, nor would it be in the interests of judicial economy to do 
so.  Accordingly, the Court considers whether Plaintiff has made a showing that reconsideration 
or other relief from the Order is warranted.                              
      In its motion, Plaintiff asserts that relief is warranted because the Court did not 
discuss in its July 7, 2022, Order each of the arguments or evidentiary citations that Plaintiff had 
proffered, but points to no authority supporting such a result.  See, e.g., United States v. 
Theodore, 797 F. App'x 452, 455 (11th Cir. 2019) (affirming district court’s denial of a second 
motion for reconsideration where plaintiff claimed the district court denied the motion “without 

explanation and by failing to address explicitly each of his arguments,” but “presented no 
authority requiring the district court do so”); Biltcliffe v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 772 F.3d 925, 930 
(1st Cir. 2014) (affirming denial of reconsideration where plaintiff protested that the district 
court failed to discuss a particular case and observing that “courts are not required to address 
every case cited by a litigant”).                                         
      Plaintiff’s lengthy submission makes clear its disagreements with the Court’s 
prior decisions.  As the Court has previously underscored, neither Rule 59(e) nor Rule 60(b) is a 
vehicle for relitigating the merits of the Court’s prior decisions, and Plaintiff’s instant motion is 
properly denied on that basis as well.  See, e.g., Sequa Corp. v. GBJ Corp., 156 F.3d 136, 144 

(2d Cir. 1998) (“It is well-settled that Rule 59 is not a vehicle for relitigating old issues, 
presenting the case under new theories, securing a rehearing on the merits, or otherwise taking a 
‘second bite at the apple[.]’”); Moreno-Cuevas v. Huntington Learning Ctr., 501 F. App’x 64, 66 
(2d Cir. 2012) (“[B]oth a Rule 60(b) motion and a motion for reconsideration are properly denied 
where they seek only to relitigate issues already decided.”).             
      The Court has again considered Plaintiff’s arguments thoroughly and concludes 
that they do not warrant the requested relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b).  Therefore, and for the 
reasons set forth in the Court’s Order dated July 7, 2022, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is 
denied.                                                                   
     This Order resolves docket entry no. 499.

                        MEMORANDUM ORDER                                 

         Plaintiff Advanced Analytics, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “AAI”) moves, pursuant to 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b)(1), (3), and (6), for reconsideration and relief 
from the Court’s Judgment entered on November 5, 2021 (docket entry no. 465), and related 
orders.  (Docket entry no. 467 (“Reconsideration Motion”).)  Plaintiff also moves, pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Evidence 201, for the Court to take judicial notice of certain documents and facts 
submitted in support of Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration.  (Docket entry no. 479 (“Motion 
for Judicial Notice”).)  The Court has reviewed carefully the parties’ submissions on both 
motions and, for the following reasons, Plaintiff’s motions are denied.   
         The factual background of this case has been discussed in prior orders of the 
Court; the parties’ familiarity with those orders is assumed.             
Motion for Reconsideration                                                
         Plaintiff seeks reconsideration of the Court’s Judgment against it and related 
orders (see docket entry nos. 461 & 464) pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 
60(b)(1), (3), and (6).  Rule 59(e) allows parties to submit a motion to “alter or amend a 
judgment” no later than “28 days after the entry of the judgment.”  Rule 59(e) motions are 
granted to “correct clear error, prevent manifest injustice or review the court’s decision in light 
of the availability of new evidence,” Parrish v. Sollecito, 253 F. Supp. 2d 713, 715 (S.D.N.Y. 
2003) (citing Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 

1992)), and are not vehicles for parties to relitigate cases or advance new theories that they failed 
to raise in their underlying motion practice.  Melnitzky v. Rose, 305 F. Supp. 2d 349, 352 
(S.D.N.Y. 2004).1  Accord Banister v. Davis, 140 S. Ct. 1698, 1703 (2020) (“[C]ourts will not 
address new arguments or evidence that the moving party could have raised before the decision 
issued.”); Sequa Corp. v. GBJ Corp., 156 F.3d 136, 144 (2d Cir. 1998) (“It is well-settled that 
Rule 59 is not a vehicle for relitigating old issues, presenting the case under new theories, 
securing a rehearing on the merits, or otherwise taking a ‘second bite at the apple[.]’”).  
Reconsideration under Rule 59(e) is “an extraordinary remedy to be employed sparingly in the 
interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.”  In re Health Mgmt. Sys., Inc. 
Sec. Litig., 113 F. Supp. 2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (citation omitted). 

         Rule 60(b) permits a party to seek relief from a final judgment, order, or 
proceeding on the grounds of “(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;” “(3) 
fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or misconduct by an 
opposing party;” or for “(6) any other reason that justifies relief.”  Rule 60(b), which “may not 
be used as a substitute for a timely appeal,” authorizes relief only upon a showing of exceptional 
circumstances.  Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 1986).  Rule 60(b) motions which 
merely seek to relitigate the merits of the Court’s prior decisions are properly denied on that 


1    Plaintiff does not argue that any new evidence has come to light, or that any intervening 
    controlling law has been issued, after the Court’s Judgment and related orders, which 
    might warrant relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b).                      
basis.  United Airlines, Inc. v. Brien, 588 F.3d 158, 176 (2d Cir. 2009) (“We have warned, 
however, that a Rule 60 motion ‘may not be used as a substitute for appeal’ and that a claim 
based on legal error alone is ‘inadequate.’” (citations omitted)); Moreno-Cuevas v. Huntington 
Learning Ctr., 501 F. App’x 64, 66 (2d Cir. 2012) (“[B]oth a Rule 60(b) motion and a motion for 

reconsideration are properly denied where they seek only to relitigate issues already decided.”); 
Fleming v. New York Univ., 865 F.2d 478, 484 (2d Cir. 1989) (“[A] Rule 60(b)(3) motion 
cannot be granted absent clear and convincing evidence of material misrepresentations and 
cannot serve as an attempt to relitigate the merits.”).  Accord Bennett v. Watson Wyatt & Co., 
156 F. Supp. 2d 270, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (“Courts in this circuit have repeatedly dismissed 
Rule 60(b) motions that simply attempt to relitigate issues and thereby circumvent the appellate 
process.”).                                                               
         Motions pursuant to Rules 59(e) and 60(b) are committed to the sound discretion 
of the district court.  Olson v. Major League Baseball, 29 F.4th 59, 72 (2d Cir. 2022) (“[W]e 
generally review the denial of a reconsideration motion under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 

59(e) and 60(b) for abuse of discretion.”); Gomez v. City of New York, 805 F.3d 419, 423 (2d 
Cir. 2015) (“Regardless of whether the motion should have been made or construed pursuant to 
Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b), the standard of review is the same: abuse of discretion.”).   
         Plaintiff’s Reconsideration Motion is, in essence, an attempt to relitigate issues 
which the Court addressed in prior orders, including some dating as far back as 2012, 2013, and 
2014.  (See Reconsideration Motion at ix, 4, 11-13; see also docket entry no. 474 (“Opp.”) 
Annex A (Defendants’ collection of instances in which Plaintiff has raised the same arguments in 
this case).)  Indeed, most of Plaintiff’s principal arguments (Reconsideration Motion §§ I-IV) 
seek to relitigate matters presented to and addressed by the Court in connection with Judge 
Pitman’s reports and recommendations on the parties’ motions for summary judgment (docket 
entry nos. 112 & 340) and this Court’s adoption of those reports.  Plaintiff’s sixth argument 
(Reconsideration Motion § VI) reraises the same allegations of conspiracy and collusion between 
Plaintiff’s former counsel and Defendants that Plaintiff has asserted in this case for several years.  

See Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Glob. Markets, Inc., No. 04-CV-3531-LTS-SLC, 
2020 WL 3056450, at *7-8 (S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2020) (collecting instances in which Plaintiff had 
raised arguments concerning its prior counsel’s collusion with Defendants), objections overruled, 
No. 04-CV-3531-LTS-SLC, 2021 WL 4478621 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2021).  These arguments 
simply attempt “to relitigate issues and thereby circumvent the appellate process,” Bennett, 156 
F. Supp. 2d at 273, and are rejected on that basis.                       
         Plaintiff’s fifth argument (Reconsideration Motion § V) takes issue with the 
Court’s most recent Order (at docket entry no. 464), which directed the entry of judgment in 
favor of Plaintiff on a limited aspect of its breach of contract claim and awarded damages on that 
aspect of Plaintiff’s claim in the nominal amount of $1—and otherwise directed the entry of 

judgment in Defendants’ favor.  Plaintiff argues that this Order “deprived Plaintiff’s rights under 
[Rule] 56 and constitutional due process” by denying Plaintiff “an opportunity to gather the 
evidence for any of [ ] three measures of damage from” Defendants’ limited breach of the 
parties’ non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”).  (Reconsideration Motion at 21-23.)  Yet Plaintiff 
had an opportunity to gather the evidence it sought during discovery, and indeed submitted 
expert testimony concerning its damages in connection with the parties’ first motions for 
summary judgment—although, as Judge Pitman explained, that evidence was not probative of 
damages stemming from the limited breach as to which the Court granted partial summary 
judgment in Plaintiff’s favor.  (Docket entry no. 112 at 34-40.)  Moreover, while a claimant is 
generally entitled to proceed to trial on the issue of contract damages when the amount of 
damages is merely undetermined, courts may properly award only nominal damages at summary 
judgment where the existence of damage is “uncertain or speculative,” Contemp. Mission, Inc. v. 
Famous Music Corp., 557 F.2d 918, 926 (2d Cir. 1977).  See, e.g., Maalouf v. Citigroup Glob. 

Markets, Inc., 156 F. App’x 367, 369 (2d Cir. 2005) (affirming limitation of damages at 
summary judgment to nominal damages); Jill Stuart (Asia) LLC v. Sanei Int’l Co., 566 F. App’x 
29, 32 (2d Cir. 2014) (affirming entry of summary judgment and award to plaintiff of nominal 
damages where the plaintiff had failed to show a theory on which more than nominal damages 
could be recovered); Vanderburgh v. Porter Sheet Metal, Inc., 86 A.D.2d 688, 446 N.Y.S.2d 523, 
525 (3rd Dep’t 1982) (“In the absence of a triable factual issue on the question of damages, 
Special Term properly awarded nominal damages on the cause of action for breach of 
contract.”).  See also ABN Amro Verzekeringen BV v. Geologistics Americas, Inc., 485 F.3d 85, 
93 (2d Cir. 2007) (a trial is not justified where it “can have no effect on the judgment”).  In this 
case, in light of the Court’s adoption of Judge Pitman’s 2009 report and recommendation (docket 

entry no. 112) as to the nature of Defendants’ breach of contract, an award of nominal damages, 
rather than a trial as to those damages, is appropriate.  (See docket entry no. 464 at 3-4.) 
         The Court has considered Plaintiff’s remaining arguments and concludes that they 
do not warrant the requested relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b).  Therefore, and for the reasons set 
forth in Defendants’ opposition brief, Plaintiff’s Reconsideration Motion is denied.2   



2    The Court has considered Defendants’ request that the Court sanction Plaintiff, as well as 
    their concern that portions of Plaintiff’s filings may not be “prepared with the substantive 
    involvement of counsel.”  (Opp. at 15.)  The Court declines in its discretion to impose 
    such sanctions, and concludes that the “further inquiry” (id.) requested by Defendants as 
    to the authorship of Plaintiff’s submissions is not in the interests of justice at this time.   
Motion to Take Judicial Notice                                            
         More than one month after Plaintiff filed its reply brief in support of its 
Reconsideration Motion, Plaintiff filed a separate motion, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 
201, requesting that the Court take judicial notice of (1) “all of the undisputed facts” in its 

accompanying memorandum of law, and (2) eleven exhibits filed in connection therewith, 
consisting of correspondence and filings related to this action and another action Plaintiff filed in 
this District in 2020 (Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. CitiGroup, Inc., No. 20-CV-7034-PGG).  
(Docket entry no. 479.)                                                   
         District courts may take notice of facts that are “not subject to reasonable 
dispute,” if such facts are “generally known” within the court’s jurisdiction or “can be accurately 
and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. 
Evid. 201(b).  Because judicial notice forecloses the parties’ “opportunity to use rebuttal 
evidence, cross-examination, and argument to attack contrary evidence, caution must be used in 
determining that a fact is beyond controversy under Rule 201(b).”  Int’l Star Class Yacht Racing 

Ass’n v. Tommy Hilfiger U.S.A., Inc., 146 F.3d 66, 70 (2d Cir. 1998).  With respect to 
documents from other litigations, “[a] court may take judicial notice of a document filed in 
another court ‘not for the truth of the matters asserted in the other litigation, but rather to 
establish the fact of such litigation and related filings.’”  Id. (quoting Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. 
Rotches Pork Packers, Inc., 969 F.2d 1384 (2d Cir. 1992)).  Facts proffered or adjudicated in 
another case “do not meet either test of indisputability contained in Rule 201(b): they are not 
usually common knowledge, nor are they derived from an unimpeachable source.”  Id.   
         Moreover, judicial notice “is not intended as a vehicle for advancing legal 
principles.”  Joyner v. Alston & Bird LLP, No. 21-CV-8549-AT-SLC, 2022 WL 913061, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2022) (quoting Williams v. Silliman, No. 9:11-CV-1477, 2014 WL 991876, 
at *4 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2014)), opinion clarified, No. 21-CV-8549-AT-SLC, 2022 WL 997385 
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2022).  Nor is a motion to take judicial notice an appropriate means to 
supplement a previously filed motion for reconsideration when the information proffered as 

judicially noticeable was available to the filing party at the time it filed for reconsideration.  
AlexSam, Inc. v. Aetna, Inc., No. 3:19-CV-01025-VAB, 2021 WL 3268853, at *9 n.8 (D. Conn. 
July 30, 2021) (“AlexSam has not offered any support for its contention that this letter is 
properly before the Court on a motion for reconsideration. AlexSam has not explained any 
reason for failing to include the letter in its earlier filings; argued that this letter is new evidence 
discovered after the Court's order of dismissal; or explained its failure to include or reference this 
letter in its motion for reconsideration.”).                              
         In this case, much of Plaintiff’s Motion for Judicial Notice is, like its 
Reconsideration Motion, an attempt to relitigate disputes previously presented to and addressed 
by the Court, including Plaintiff’s allegations of collusion on the part of its prior counsel, and to 

add color to those allegations.  To the extent the Motion for Judicial Notice seeks to bolster the 
arguments made in that Reconsideration Motion, the Court disregards it as an unauthorized 
surreply.  Farmer v. Cnty. of Westchester, No. 18-CV-2691-NSR, 2021 WL 4199944, at *5 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2021) (“The Court does not consider Plaintiff's unauthorized sur-reply 
considering his failure to first seek leave to file such a sur-reply.”); Intellivision v. Microsoft 
Corp., 784 F. Supp. 2d 356, 366 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (“the Court need not consider many of 
these untimely, multiplicative, and unauthorized filings”), aff’d, 484 F. App’x 616 (2d Cir. 
2012).  To the extent it seeks for the Court to accept the truth of the “undisputed facts” presented 
in Plaintiff’s own correspondence and memoranda submitted to this Court and in Plaintiff’s 2020 
action, the Motion for Judicial Notice seeks relief outside the purview of Rule 201.  To the extent 
it seeks yet again to urge the Court to consider stricken documents (see docket entry no. 479-11 
(resubmitting stricken Exhibit SSS to the Fourth Fan Declaration)3) in connection with the merits 
of this case, Plaintiff and its counsel are advised that further such submissions may result in the 

imposition of sanctions.                                                  
         Plaintiff’s Motion for Judicial Notice is granted, on consent (docket entry no. 
485), to the limited extent that the Court acknowledges the existence of the documents submitted 
by Plaintiff which were previously filed or submitted in connection with this case and with 
Plaintiff’s 2020 action.  It is otherwise denied.                         

                           CONCLUSION                                    
         For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration (docket 
entry no. 467) and motion to take judicial notice (docket entry no. 479) are denied. 
         This Memorandum Order resolves docket entry nos. 467, 479, and 484.  The 
Clerk of Court is also respectfully directed to terminate the gavel at docket entry no. 472 (see 

docket entry nos. 473 & 475.)

Chief Judge Laura Taylor Swain 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse                    MEMO  ENDORSED 
500 Pearl Street, Room 702 
New York, NY 10007 
VIA ECF ELECTRONIC FILING 
Re. Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. et al, 
 04 Civ. 3531 (LTS) (SLC) 
Dear Chief Judge Swain: 
 We represent Advanced Analytics, Inc. (the “Plaintiff’). We write because we are unsure 
about the Court’s intention from its endorsement (the “Order,” ECF No. 487) of Citigroup 
Global Markets, Inc. and The Yield Book Inc. (the “Defendants”)’ response and application of 
February 8, 2022 (the “Application,” ECF No. 485) containing numerous improper and 
confusing requests regarding Plaintiff's motion pursuant to F. R. E. 201 in Support of Motions 
Under F.R.C.P. 59(e) and 60(b) (the “FRE 201 Motion,” ECF No. 479). And we are concerned 
that the two sentences in our letter of February 9, 2022 (ECF486), which was not intended as the 
response to Defendants’ long Application filed the night before, may be misunderstood by the 
Court. Accordingly, Plaintiff respectfully seeks for the Court to clarify/modify its Order, 
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 6.3 and Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2) and (e). If the Order would require 
the Court’s leave for a motion to reconsider itself, Plaintiff would seek leave to do so.' The 
proposed letter motion to reconsider is attached as Ex.1 for the Court’s convenience. 
 Defendants filed its Application in the evening of February 8, 2022 without consulting 
Plaintiff, in violation of the Court’s Individual Rule of Practice 2(b). Concerned that the Court 
would endorse Defendants’ improper request without allowing Plaintiff the opportunity to 
respond as before, on February 9, 2022, Plaintiff informed the Court of its intention to file a 
response in the 1-page letter. Regarding Defendants’ request for extension of the deadline for 
' See MJ Cave June 9, 2020 ECF 438 at 17, “The Second Circuit has noted that, ‘a court has no power to prevent a 
party from filing motions authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,’” or by Federal laws for that matter. 
Eisemann v. Greene, 204 F.3d 393, 397 (2d Cir. 2000). See Vermont Teddy Bear Co. v. 1-800 Beargram Co., 373 
F.3d 241, 242 (2d Cir. 2004) (“See 28 U.S.C. § 2071(a) (mandating that court rules remain consistent with general 
rules of practice and procedure); Fed.R.Civ.P. 83 (same);”) (citing to other authority). The Federal Rules of 
Evidence is Federal statutory law. 
                                1/2 

“fulsome briefing,” “Plaintiff would welcome the opportunity.” “This would also be consistent 
with Defendants’ request.” Fn 1, p.1, Id. (ECF No. 486.)                  
Unfortunately, without allowing Plaintiff’s response of being heard, the Court endorsed 
the “[a]pplication granted to the extent that Defendants’ time to respond to Plaintiff’s motion and 
request for judicial notice (docket entry no. 479) is held in abeyance pending the Court’s 
resolution of [Plaintiff’s Motion under Rule 59(e) and 60(b)].”           
This ruling is unclear to us. Without clarification by the Court, if the Court were to deny 
Plaintiff’s Rule 59(e) and 60(b) Motion (ECF No. 467), the Order would deny Plaintiff’s FRE 
201 Motion by Defendants mere baseless “Application” without providing an opportunity for 
Plaintiff to respond “on the propriety of taking judicial notice,” as provided by FRE 201(e) 
(Either “party is entitled upon timely request to an opportunity to be heard as to the propriety of 
taking judicial notice and the nature of the matter noticed”). It would also be contrary to FRE 
201(c)(2) (“the Court must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with 
the necessary information.”).                                             
The Application presented no basis to deny the FRE 201 Motion in support of the Rule 
59(e) and 60(b) Motion. Thus, Plaintiff respectfully believes that the Court may have 
misunderstood Plaintiff’s consent to “fulsome briefing” as to “hold in abeyance.”2 To avoid any 
doubt, by “[t]his would also be consistent with Defendants’ request,” Plaintiff meant Defendants’ 
request that “the Court [should] set a briefing scheduling providing Defendants with two weeks 
from the date of such scheduling order to submit their opposition to the Rule 201 Motion,” and 
Plaintiff’s reply would one week after their opposition.  Plaintiff definitely does not consent to 
denying FRE201 Motion in support of Rule 59(e) and 60(b) Motion by holding it in “abeyance.” 
The Application presented no substantive opposition to the FRE 201 Motion.  Plaintiff 
respectfully submits that the Court should resolve the FRE 201 Motion before or at least with the 
Rule 59(e) and 60(b) Motion, and grant the Application’s request to the extent that Defendants 
file their opposition brief within 14 days from endorsement of this Letter, and Plaintiff may file 
reply within 7 days afterwards.                                           
                               Plaintiff’s letter-motion to modify the Court’s endorsement dated 
          Respectfully submitted,  February 10, 2022 (docket entry no. 487) is denied.  The Court 
                               received and considered Plaintiff’s letter dated February 9, 2022, 
                               before issuing that endorsement.  Plaintiff’s motion for judicial 
          /s/ Peter Toren      notice (docket entry no. 484) is not denied.  It shall remain 
          Peter J. Toren       pending, and further briefing on that motion shall remain held in 
                               abeyance, pending the Court’s resolution of Plaintiff’s pending 
                               motion for reconsideration (docket entry no. 467), which may 
                               render moot the need for further briefing on Plaintiff’s motion 
                               for judicial notice.                  
                               SO ORDERED.                           
                               Dated: March 8, 2022                  
                               /s/ Laura Taylor Swain, Chief U.S.D.J.  
2 Plaintiff’s Letter requested only the court hold its rulings until after Plaintiff’s response to Defendants’ 
Application. But its Docket entry under the rigid ECF format had to be “Letter Motion to Continue.” This may have 
compounded the misunderstanding. Docket Entry 489: “…[486] LETTER MOTION to Continue Ruling on 
Defendants Request. addressed to Judge Laura Taylor Swain from Peter J. Toren dated Feb. 9, 2022 filed by 
Advanced Analytics, Inc. Application granted to the extent that…”

     MEMORANDUM ORDER ADOPTING REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION             

     Plaintiff Advanced Analytics, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “AAI”) has filed objections to 
the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Pitman, dated September 4, 2019 (docket 
entry no. 340 (the “Report”)), which recommends that the motion for summary judgment filed by 
Defendants Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and The Yield Book, Inc. (“Defendants”) be granted; 
to the Opinion and Order of Judge Pitman, also dated September 4, 2019 (docket entry no. 339 
(the “Rule 56(h) Ord.”)), which denied Plaintiff’s related motion pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 56(h); and to the Opinion and Order of Magistrate Judge Cave, dated June 9, 
2020 (docket entry no. 438 (the “Reconsideration Ord.”)), which denied Plaintiff’s motion for 
reconsideration of two of Judge Cave’s non-dispositive orders in the above-captioned action.  
The Court has jurisdiction of this case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1332. 
     The Court has reviewed thoroughly the parties’ submissions on the objections as 
well as the papers filed in connection with the underlying motions and, for the following reasons, 
overrules each of Plaintiff’s objections and adopts the Report in its entirety. 
                      BACKGROUND                                     
     The factual background of this case has been discussed in prior orders of the 
Court; the parties’ familiarity with them is assumed.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendants 
misappropriated number sequences developed by Plaintiff’s principal, Dr. Xiaolu Wang (the 

“ACE Sequences”), during Defendants’ testing of those sequences, which were then 
incorporated into a software product (“the Yield Book”) or used to create new sequences of 
numbers for use in the Yield Book.  On May 7, 2004, Plaintiff filed its Complaint (docket entry 
no. 1) asserting claims for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of the 
duty of good faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust.  
On July 1, 2004, Defendants filed an Answer and counterclaim (docket entry no. 11) asserting 
their entitlement to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs, in the event they prevailed in this 
action, under the terms of the parties’ January 7, 1997, non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”).   
     On February 15, 2008, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  On 
August 5, 2009, Judge Pitman issued a report and recommendation (docket entry no. 112 (the 

“2009 Report”)) recommending that judgment be entered in favor of Plaintiff on Plaintiff’s claim 
that Defendants breached the NDA, to the extent that claim arose from Defendants’ admission 
that their sequence developer, Teytel, had used outputs from Defendants’ testing of the ACE 
Sequences (but not the sequences themselves) to compare the accuracy of outputs from 
sequences allegedly developed by Teytel, but only to the extent of a nominal damages award of 
one dollar, based on a conclusion that Plaintiff had failed to proffer evidence of damages flowing 
from Teytel’s “research (i.e. non-investment)” misuse of the ACE outputs.  The 2009 Report 
recommended that judgment be entered in favor of Defendants in all other respects, including to 
the extent that Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim asserted that Teytel used or targeted the ACE 
Sequences themselves (rather than merely the outputs of Defendants’ testing of those sequences) 
in developing his own sequences on behalf of Defendants.  See Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. 
Citigroup Glob. Markets, Inc., No. 04-CV-3531-LTS-HBP, 2009 WL 7133660, at *7-25 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2009), report and recommendation adopted in part, rejected in part, 04-CV-

3531-LTS-HBP, 2010 WL 4780772 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2010).  The 2009 Report also 
recommended that the Court enter judgment in favor of Defendants on their counterclaim for an 
award of fees and costs, given that Defendants had “prevailed with regard to the central relief 
sought” for purposes of the NDA.  Id. at *24.                             
     In a Memorandum Order dated November 22, 2010 (docket entry no. 124 (the 
“2010 Order”)), the Court adopted the 2009 Report in several respects and entered judgment in 
favor of Defendants on Plaintiff’s claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, 
quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment.  Advanced Analytics, 2010 WL 4780772, at *3.1  
However, the Court declined to adopt the 2009 Report’s recommendations “regarding the 
character of Teytel’s use of the output and the significance of that use as to the appropriate 

measure of damages,” id. at *2, and therefore granted Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, 
to the extent it claimed that Teytel’s use of the ACE test results was in violation of the parties’ 
NDA, as to liability only, leaving open the question of the appropriate measure of damages.  As 
to the remainder of Plaintiff’s breach of contract claim—regarding Plaintiff’s allegations that 
Teytel used or targeted the ACE Sequences in developing his own—the Court denied both 


1    The 2010 Order also necessarily disposed of Plaintiff’s claim for “constructive trust,” 
which is an equitable remedy, not a separate cause of action, Blank v. TriPoint Glob. 
Equities, LLC, 338 F. Supp. 3d 194, 220 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), and which depends on the 
party seeking the trust establishing a claim for unjust enrichment.  Id.; In re First Cent. 
Fin. Corp., 377 F.3d 209, 212 (2d Cir. 2004) (“The fourth element [unjust enrichment] is 
the most important since ‘the purpose of the constructive trust is prevention of unjust 
enrichment.’”) (citation omitted).                                   
parties’ motions for summary judgment, explaining that, on the then-existing record, evidence of 
references to ACE in a notebook maintained by Teytel (the “Teytel Notebook”) and the expert 
evidence proffered by Plaintiff “would be sufficient to support a reasonable jury’s determination 
in Plaintiff’s favor on this aspect of the breach of contract claim.”  Id.  The Court also noted, 

however, that “apparently relevant discovery (in the form of Defendants’ development and 
testing records) requested by Plaintiff and ordered produced by the Magistrate Judge has not yet 
been produced,” rendering summary judgment inappropriate.  Id.  Similarly, the Court concluded 
as to Plaintiffs’ timely2 misappropriation claims that summary judgment in favor of Defendants 
was “premature as well as unwarranted on the current record because there [was] a genuine issue 
of material fact as to whether Defendants’ sequences were derived from the ACE sequence,” and 
because “the outstanding testing and development discovery may be relevant to whether Plaintiff 
can frame a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendants’ disclosed practices were a 
front for actual use of the ACE sequence in generating Yield Book outputs.”  Id. at *3.  Having 
so concluded, the Court also declined to adopt, as “premature,” the 2009 Report’s 

recommendation that the Court grant Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on their 
counterclaim for attorneys’ fees under the parties’ NDA because “genuine issues of material fact 
preclude[d] the resolution at this stage of most of the parties’ dispute concerning breach of the 
NDA.”  Id. at *4.                                                         
     On or about March 7, 2011, Defendants produced the testing and development 
files discussed in the 2010 Order.  (Report at 18; Defendants’ Statement of Undisputed Facts 
Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1, dated April 5, 2013 (“Def’t 56.1 Stmt.”) ¶ 67.)  Defendants 


2    The Court adopted the 2009 Report’s recommendation that Plaintiffs’ misappropriation 
claim, to the extent premised on Defendants’ development and use of a 100-path 
sequence, was barred by the statute of limitations.  Id. at *3.      
subsequently produced evidence from their retained expert, Dr. Nathaniel Polish, who analyzed 
the testing and development files and opined that they reflect, consistent with Teytel’s Notebook 
and testimony, Teytel’s independent development of Defendants’ sequences, and that there was 
not “any data or code in the Sequence Development and Testing Files to suggest that Dr. Teytel 

relied upon, targeted or had access to the ACE Numbers or any product of the ACE Numbers,” 
while he was developing Defendants’ sequences.  (Second Expert Report of Dr. Nathaniel 
Polish, dated June 18, 2012 (Exhibit 35 to the Declaration of Nathaniel E. Jedrey dated April 5, 
2013) (“Second Polish Report”) at 15; Report at 29-30.)  Plaintiff did not timely produce any 
contrary expert opinion evidence analyzing the testing and development files produced by 
Defendants on March 7, 2011.  (Report at 29-30; Def’t 56.1 Stmt. ¶ 79.)   
     Against that backdrop, Defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment 
as to Plaintiff’s remaining claims3; Plaintiff separately moved for sanctions pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 56(h), based on Plaintiff’s claim that Defendants submitted affidavits in 
support of summary judgment in bad faith.  On September 4, 2019, Judge Pitman issued an 

Opinion and Order denying Plaintiff’s Rule 56(h) motion, as well as the Report, recommending 
that the Court grant Defendants’ motion for summary judgment in its entirety.  On June 9, 2020, 
Judge Cave—who was assigned the pretrial management of this action after Judge Pitman’s 
retirement in 2019—issued an Opinion and Order resolving Plaintiff’s motion for 
reconsideration as to Judge Cave’s resolution of two ancillary disputes between the parties.  
Plaintiff has filed objections to all three decisions.                    



3    Defendants did not renew their motion for summary judgment as to Defendants’ 
counterclaim for costs and fees, which remains pending, as discussed below. 
                       DISCUSSION                                    
     When reviewing a report and recommendation, the Court “may accept, reject, or 
modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.”  28 
U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (Westlaw through P.L. 117-41).  The Court must make a de novo 

determination to the extent that a party makes specific objections to a magistrate judge’s 
findings.  Soley v. Wasserman, 823 F. Supp. 2d 221, 228 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing United States 
v. Male Juvenile, 121 F.3d 34, 38 (2d Cir. 1997)).  “However, when a party makes only 
conclusory or general objections, or simply reiterates his original arguments, the court reviews 
the report and recommendation strictly for clear error.”  Piligian v. Icahn Sch. of Med. at Mount 
Sinai, 490 F. Supp. 3d 707, 715 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
     When a party objects to a magistrate judge’s non-dispositive order, the Court 
must review the objections and “modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly 
erroneous or is contrary to law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).  A decision is 
clearly erroneous where “the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and 

firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.”  Gualandi v. Adams, 385 F.3d 236, 240 (2d 
Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  An order is “contrary to law when it fails to apply or misapplies 
relevant statutes, case law or rules of procedure.”  Gym Door Repairs, Inc. v. Young Equip. 
Sales, Inc., 444 F. Supp. 3d 484, 487 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (citation omitted).  This standard of 
review is “highly deferential”; magistrate judges “are afforded broad discretion in resolving 
nondispositive disputes and reversal is appropriate only if their discretion is abused.”  Thai Lao 
Lignite (Thailand) Co. v. Gov’t of Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 924 F. Supp. 2d 508, 511-
12 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citation omitted).                                    
Plaintiff’s Objections to the Report                                      
     The Court turns first to Plaintiff’s objections to the Report, which recommends 
that the Court grant Defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiff’s 
remaining claims for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract.  (Docket entry no. 

390 (“Report Objs.”).)                                                    
     As set forth in greater detail in the Report, Judge Pitman concluded—in light of 
Defendants’ production of their testing and development records and unrebutted expert 
testimony analyzing those records and comparing Defendants’ sequences to the ACE 
Sequences—that Plaintiff has failed to introduce evidence that Defendants’ sequences were 
similar to or derived from Plaintiff’s sequences.  Advanced Analytics, 2019 WL 9466011, at *8-
10.  The Report also rejected Plaintiff’s argument that summary judgment should be denied 
because of Plaintiff’s allegations of discovery misconduct—including that Defendants 
“fabricated” certain of the sequences they produced in discovery, “modified” their testing and 
development records before producing them, and withheld the true “production” sequences used 

by the Yield Book.  Id. at *11-14.  The Report further concluded that, on the current record, “the 
three ambiguous references to ACE in Teytel’s notebook . . . [are] not sufficient evidence of 
misappropriation” to defeat Defendants’ motion for summary judgment, id. at *14, and rejected 
Plaintiff’s new theory that Defendants’ development of portfolio hedging abilities around the 
same time as Defendants conducted the ACE testing raised a genuine dispute of fact as to 
whether Defendants’ sequences were derived from the ACE Sequences.  Id. at *14-15.  The 
Report therefore recommended entry of judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff’s remaining 
misappropriation and breach of contract claims.                           
     The first fourteen pages of Plaintiff’s objections, which purport to detail the 
means by which Defendants stole and used the ACE Sequences, rely almost exclusively on 
Plaintiff’s counsel’s interpretation of raw computer code produced by Defendants in discovery, 
unsupported by lay or expert witness testimony concerning the meaning of that code.  Plaintiff’s 

counsel’s unsupported conclusions about Defendants’ code are insufficient to raise a genuine 
dispute of fact.  Paone v. Microsoft Corp., 881 F. Supp. 2d 386, 415 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) 
(“Unsubstantiated attorney argument regarding the meaning of technical evidence is no 
substitute for competent, substantiated expert testimony.” (citation omitted)); Demarco v. 
Ouellette, No. 04-CV-0440-RJH, 2005 WL 2170557, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2005) (quoting 
Lavine v. Town of Lake Luzerne, 296 A.D.2d 793, 794 (3d Dep’t 2002)) (“non-expert attorney’s 
opinion has ‘no probative value’”).4  Counsel’s interpretation of Defendants’ “theft code” and 
“use code” therefore does not provide a basis for rejection of the Report. 
     Next, Plaintiff objects to Judge Pitman’s “finding of no discovery abuse by 
Defendants.”  (Report Objs. at 18-20, 24-25.)  Magistrate judges are afforded “broad discretion 

in resolving discovery disputes,” In re Keurig Green Mountain Single-Serve Coffee Antitrust 
Litig., 336 F.R.D. 400, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (citation omitted), however, and Plaintiff’s claims 
of discovery misconduct by Defendants largely recycle arguments which have already been 
presented to, and rejected by, this Court.  See, e.g., Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Glob. 
Markets, Inc., No. 04-CV-3531-LTS-HBP, 2013 WL 489061, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2013) 
(“For substantially the reasons stated by Judge Pitman at the September 5, 2012, hearing, and in 
light of the evidence proffered by Defendants that Plaintiff has everything it needs to compare 


4    Several of Plaintiff’s responses to Defendants’ Local Civil Rule 56.1 statement suffer 
from the same deficiency.  (See, e.g., Plaintiff’s Revised Responses to Defendants’ 
Statement of Undisputed Facts, dated May 28, 2014 ¶¶ 16, 20, 51, 68.) 
Defendants’ sequences, analyze the code that Defendants use to generate their sequences to 
determine whether this process could have been derived from Defendants’ alleged exposure to 
the Plaintiff’s product and determine whether the Plaintiff’s product played any role in the 
development of Defendants’ sequences, the Court does not find any basis for overturning Judge 

Pitman’s decision to deny Plaintiff’s application for additional production of Defendants’ 
code.”); (Rule 56(h) Ord. at 2 (“All of the discovery issues concerning plaintiff’s theory that 
defendants were withholding evidence have been previously litigated.”).)   
     Finally, Plaintiff notes that the Court’s 2010 Order concluded that the “Teytel 
notebook and the expert evidence proffered by Plaintiff in this connection . . . would be 
sufficient to support a reasonable jury’s determination in Plaintiff’s favor” on Plaintiff’s claim 
that Defendants breached the NDA by using Plaintiff’s confidential information to develop the 
Teytel sequences, Advanced Analytics, 2010 WL 4780772, at *2, and on Plaintiff’s remaining 
misappropriation claims.  Id. at *3 (“The recommended grant of summary judgment in 
Defendants’ favor is, accordingly, premature as well as unwarranted on the current record[.]”) 

(emphasis added).  (See Report Objs. at 15-18, 21-24.)  However, the Court reached that 
conclusion on a different record which did not include the development and testing records 
reflecting Teytel’s development of Defendants’ sequences, or Defendants’ unrebutted expert 
testimony that those records confirm that Teytel developed his sequences in accordance with the 
methodology described in the Teytel Notebook, and not through reliance upon, targeting, or 
accessing the ACE Sequences.  (See Report at 18, 27, 29-30; see also Second Polish Report § 
II(A) (opining, based on his review of the sequence development and testing files produced by 
Defendants after the Court’s 2010 Order, that “Defendants developed their 200 path mixed-seed 
sequence in accordance with the methodology described by Dr. Mikhail Teytel in his notebook,” 
and that nothing in those files “suggest[s] that Dr. Teytel relied upon, targeted or had access to 
the ACE Numbers while he was developing the 200 path mixed-seed sequence”); Def’t 56.1 
Stmt. ¶¶ 66-67, 78-79.)  In light of this record, the Court agrees with, and adopts, the Report’s 
conclusion that the few references to ACE in the Teytel Notebook and the expert evidence 

proffered by Plaintiff are insufficient to meet Plaintiff’s prima facie burden of demonstrating 
similarity or derivation in the first instance.  (See Report at 24-45.)  Moreover, they are also 
insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the independent development of the 
Teytel sequences in light of the additional unrebutted evidence in the augmented record.  See 
Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 476 (1974) (“trade secret law, however, does 
not offer protection against discovery by fair and honest means, such as by independent 
invention”); Integrated Cash Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Digital Transactions, Inc., 732 F. Supp. 370, 
377-78 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (“It is a well-recognized principle that, where a defendant in a trade 
secret case claims independent development, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that this 
was in fact the case.”), aff’d, 920 F.2d 171 (2d Cir. 1990); AEB & Assocs. Design Grp., Inc. v. 

Tonka Corp., 853 F. Supp. 724, 734 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (“A plaintiff cannot recover for 
misappropriation absent a showing that its ideas were actually used by the defendant.”).5 

5    In the last half-page of Plaintiff’s objections to the Report, Plaintiff objects to Judge 
Pitman’s separate Order, dated May 28, 2019 (docket entry no. 312), denying a motion 
Plaintiff filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), which was also 
principally based on Plaintiff’s claims of discovery misconduct by Defendants.  (Report 
Objs. at 25.)  As Defendants correctly argue, Plaintiff’s objections to Judge Pitman’s May 
28, 2019, Order are late, see Caidor v. Onondaga Cty., 517 F.3d 601, 604 (2d Cir. 2008) 
(failure to timely object to a magistrate judge’s decision waives further judicial review), 
as was Plaintiff’s motion pursuant to Rule 56(d), see Turner v. McDonough, No. 18-CV-
4038-AEK, 2021 WL 965626, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2021) (“Relief under Rule 56(d) 
is not available when summary judgment motions are made after the close of discovery.” 
(citation omitted)), and the Court therefore declines to review Plaintiff’s summary 
objections to that Order.                                            
     The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s remaining arguments and finds none of them 
meritorious.  Accordingly, the Court overrules Plaintiff’s objections to the Report and adopts the 
Report in its entirety.                                                   

Plaintiff’s Objections to Judge Pitman’s Opinion and Order dated September 4, 2019  
     The Court next addresses Plaintiff’s objections to Judge Pitman’s Opinion and 
Order dated September 4, 2019.  (Docket entry no. 361 (“Rule 56(h) Objs”).)   
     In that Opinion and Order, Judge Pitman denied Plaintiff’s motion which sought 
an order striking the declarations submitted by Defendants in support of their motion for 
summary judgment and imposing related sanctions.  After noting that “[m]uch of plaintiff’s Rule 

56(h) motion appears to have little or no connection to the legal requirements for an award of 
sanctions under Rule 56(h),”6 Judge Pitman rejected the three bases he discerned for Plaintiff’s 
motion: that “(1) defendants are guilty of discovery misconduct; (2) defendants’ motion is 
groundless because plaintiff is entitled to prevail on the merits[;] and (3) defendants have 
submitted declarations that are not based on personal knowledge and/or are false.”  (Rule 56(h) 
Ord. at 5.)                                                               
     Rule 56(h) provides that a court, “[i]f satisfied that an affidavit or declaration” 
filed in connection with a motion for summary judgment “is submitted in bad faith or solely for 
delay,” “may order the submitting party to pay the other party the reasonable expenses, including 
attorney’s fees, it incurred as a result,” and may also hold an offending party or attorney in 

contempt or subject them to other appropriate sanctions.  Bad faith “may be found when an 

6    For instance, Judge Pitman noted that “plaintiff spends several pages claiming, without 
any evidence, that its former counsel colluded with defense counsel,” but explained that 
plaintiff’s principal’s “disagreements with plaintiff’s former counsel . . . [did] not imply 
that the attorney [was] colluding with the other side.”  (Rule 56(h) Ord. at 5.)   
attorney’s actions are ‘so completely without merit . . . that they must have been undertaken for 
some improper purpose.’”  Jimenez v. City of New York, 666 F. App’x 39, 41 (2d Cir. 2016) 
(quoting Schlaifer Nance & Co. v. Estate of Warhol, 194 F.3d 323, 338 (2d Cir. 1999)).  Such a 
finding may be appropriate where an attorney’s conduct is “egregious,” Jaisan, Inc. v. Sullivan, 

178 F.R.D. 412, 415 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); “even [where] the Court finds [a party’s] arguments 
meritless,” however, “it does not necessarily follow that they were made in bad faith,” Creusot-
Loire Int’l, Inc. v. Coppus Eng’g Corp., 585 F. Supp. 45, 52 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). 
     The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s objections and concludes that Plaintiff has not 
met its burden to show that Judge Pitman’s denial of Plaintiff’s Rule 56(h) motion was clearly 
erroneous or contrary to law.  Contrary to Plaintiff’s contention (Rule 56(h) Objs. at 6-7), Judge 
Pitman did not misunderstand the appropriate standard; he accurately recited that “an order to 
pay expenses pursuant to Rule 56(h) requires a finding of ‘bad faith,’ which courts have found 
only when the attorney’s conduct is ‘egregious,’ such as ‘where affidavits contained perjurious 
or blatantly false allegations or omitted facts concerning issues central to the resolution of the 

case.’”  (Rule 56(h) Ord. at 4 (quoting Stern v. Regency Towers, LLC, 886 F. Supp. 2d 317, 327 
(S.D.N.Y. 2012)) (emphasis added; internal citations omitted).)  Similarly, Judge Pitman did not 
err by “fail[ing] to apply” Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) (see Rule 56(h) Objs. at 7-8), 
which Plaintiff raised only in passing in its underlying motion papers.  (See docket entry no. 313 
at 24 & 24 n.45.)  Moreover, none of Plaintiff’s specific challenges to Defendants’ declarants 
suggest that Defendants submitted their declarations in support of summary judgment in bad 
faith.  (See Rule 56(h) Ord. at 10-18.)                                   
     The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s remaining arguments and finds none of them 
meritorious.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to identify any clear error or 
erroneous application of the law by Judge Pitman with regards to the Rule 56(h) Order and the 
Court overrules Plaintiff’s objections as to that Order.                  

Plaintiff’s Objections to Judge Cave’s Opinion and Order dated June 9, 2020 
     The Court next addresses Plaintiff’s objections to Judge Cave’s Opinion and 
Order dated June 9, 2020.  (Docket entry no. 442 (“Reconsideration Objs.”).)   
     In her June 9, 2020, Opinion and Order, Judge Cave denied Plaintiff’s motion for 
reconsideration of two orders: a Case Management Order dated November 12, 2019 (docket 
entry no. 375 (the “CMO”)), and an Order calculating the amount of attorneys’ fees due to 
Defendants (docket entry no. 389, as amended at docket entry no. 410 (the “Fee Award”)) by 

virtue of an Opinion and Order issued by Judge Pitman on March 26, 2014—as to which 
Plaintiff filed, and the Court overruled, objections, in 2014.  See Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. 
Citigroup Glob. Markets, Inc., 301 F.R.D. 31, 44 (S.D.N.Y. 2014), objections overruled, 301 
F.R.D. 47 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).                                                
     With one exception discussed below, Plaintiff does not object to the specific 
conclusions reached by Judge Cave in the CMO, Fee Award, or Reconsideration Order.  For 
example, Plaintiff does not object to the Reconsideration Order’s denial of reconsideration of 
Judge Cave’s prior “pre-authorization” orders as moot (see Reconsideration Ord. at 17-18), or to 
any of Judge Cave’s mathematical calculations in the Fee Award.  (See id. at 18-20.)  Instead, 
Plaintiff’s objections detail alleged collusion between Defendants and Plaintiff’s prior counsel 

and what Plaintiff believes are Defendants’ “three levels of fraud” perpetuated on the Court in 
this action; claim that the collusion and fraud call into question the rulings issued by this Court 
from the “latter part of 2012 until 2014”; and ask the Court to conduct an investigation into that 
fraud and collusion.  These claims, many if not all of which seek to relitigate issues already 
decided by the Court, are only tangentially related to the challenged orders issued by Judge 
Cave, and, to the extent they are, do not satisfy Plaintiff’s burden to show that Judge Cave’s 
Reconsideration Order was clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.7       
     Plaintiff’s sole objection specifically tailored to the rulings in Judge Cave’s 

Reconsideration Order is that Judge Cave erred in “impos[ing] fees on AAI and its [current] 
counsel, instead of [AAI’s former counsel], the lawyer [who] procured” the March 26, 2014, 
Order from Judge Pitman “in collusion with” Defendants.  (Reconsideration Objs. at 23-25.)  
However, the Reconsideration Order referred to Plaintiff’s “joint liability with its former 
counsel” (id. at 19 (emphasis added))—i.e., as provided in Judge Pitman’s March 26, 2014, 
Order, “AAI and its counsel” as of March 26, 2014.  Advanced Analytics, 301 F.R.D. at 44.  The 
Court therefore declines to disturb the Reconsideration Order on that basis.   
     The Court has reviewed Plaintiff’s remaining arguments and finds none of them 
meritorious.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to identify any clear error or 
erroneous application of the law by Judge Cave with regards to the Reconsideration Order and 

the Court overrules Plaintiff’s objections as to that Order.              
Order to Show Cause                                                       
     For the reasons set forth above, the Court has concluded that Defendants are 
entitled to summary judgment on each of Plaintiff’s claims, except as to Plaintiff’s breach of 


7    Plaintiff claims that the Reconsideration Order “failed to apply” Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 54(b) (Reconsideration Objs. at 20-23), which permits a Court to reconsider a 
prior decision at any time before the entry of final judgment.  However, Judge Cave 
considered and applied Rule 54(b) (see Reconsideration Order at 8-9), and concluded that 
Plaintiff had failed to “point to an intervening change in controlling law, new evidence 
that just became available, any showing that reconsideration is needed to correct clear 
error, or any showing that reconsideration is needed to prevent manifest injustice,” in 
connection with Plaintiff’s allegations of collusion.  (Id. at 14-16.)   
contract claim, to the extent that claim is based on Teytel’s use of outputs from Defendants’ 
testing of Plaintiff’s ACE Sequences (but not the sequences themselves) to compare the accuracy 
of outputs from sequences developed by Teytel.  In light of this conclusion, the Court will direct 
Plaintiff to show cause why the Court should not adopt Judge Pitman’s 2009 Report to the extent 

that the 2009 Report recommended (1) an award of nominal damages in favor of Plaintiff on its 
breach of contract claim, based on that use, and (2) entry of judgment in favor of Defendants on 
their counterclaim for an award of fees and costs under the NDA.  See Advanced Analytics, 2010 
WL 4780772, at *2 (declining to adopt the 2009 Report’s recommendation that Plaintiff be 
awarded nominal damages in the amount of one dollar as “premature” given unresolved 
questions concerning the character of Teytel’s access to and use of ACE); id. at *3-4 (declining 
to adopt the 2009 Report’s recommendation that Defendants be awarded fees and costs under the 
NDA as “premature” given unresolved issues of material fact as to the parties’ disputes 
concerning breach of the NDA).                                            


                       CONCLUSION                                    
     For the reasons set forth above, the Report (docket entry no. 340) is adopted in its 
entirety, and Plaintiff’s objections to the Report, as well as to Judge Pitman’s Opinion and Order 
dated September 4, 2019 (docket entry no. 339), and to Judge Cave’s Opinion and Order dated 
June 9, 2020 (docket entry no. 438), are overruled.                       

                   ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE                               
     Plaintiff is directed to show cause in a written submission not to exceed ten pages, 
no later than October 22, 2021, why, in light of this Memorandum Order, the Court should not 
adopt the 2009 Report’s recommendations concerning Plaintiff’s entitlement to nominal damages 
and Defendants’ counterclaim and enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff on its breach of contract 
claim, to the extent that claim is based on Teytel’s limited use of the outputs of Defendants’ 
testing of ACE, and award Plaintiff damages in the nominal amount of $1; and otherwise enter 

judgment in favor of Defendants as to the remainder of Plaintiff’s claims and as to Defendants’ 
counterclaim for fees and costs under the NDA.                            

     This Memorandum Order resolves docket entry nos. 361 and 442.

SARAH L. CAVE, United States Magistrate Judge.                            

    Before  the  Court  is  the  Motion  of  Plaintiff  Advanced  Analytics,  Inc.  (“AAI”)  for 
reconsideration  of  two  of  the  Court’s  pretrial  orders  in  this  action  (the  “Motion  for 
Reconsideration”).  (ECF No. 423).  In support of its Motion for Reconsideration, AAI filed the 
Fourth Declaration of Xiaolu Wang, Ph.D., dated April 23, 2015 (the “Wang Declaration”).  (ECF 
No. 426).  Defendants subsequently sought a conference regarding their anticipated motion to 
exclude the Wang Declaration (“Defendants’ Conference Motion”).  (ECF No. 429).  The parties 
each assert that their adversary’s filings are frivolous and seek their respective fees and costs 
arising from the current briefing.  (ECF Nos. 427–28).                    
    For  the  reasons  set forth below:    (1)  AAI’s  Motion  for  Reconsideration  is  DENIED; 
(2) Defendants’ request to exclude the Wang Declaration is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN 
PART; (3) the parties’ requests for costs and fees are DENIED; and (4) Defendants’ Conference 
Motion is DENIED.                                                         
                        I.  BACKGROUND                                   
 A.  Factual Background                                                  
    Given the lengthy history of this action, the Court assumes the reader’s familiarity with 

the  background  of  this  case  and  references,  where  appropriate,  those  facts  relevant  and 
necessary to explain this Opinion & Order.  A comprehensive recitation of the events giving rise 
to this action is set forth in the Honorable Henry B. Pitman’s Opinion & Order dated March 26, 
2014 granting Defendants’ motion for expenses.  (ECF No. 235) (the “March 2014 Order”). 
    This action has been pending for over sixteen years and stems from AAI’s allegations that 

Defendants misappropriated AAI’s sequences of numbers used to aid in pricing mortgage-backed 
securities and incorporated them into Defendants’ software, known as the Yield Book, or used 
them to create new sequences for use in the Yield Book.  (ECF No. 235 at 3).  
 B.  Procedural Background                                               
    In January 2012, Judge Pitman set a revised discovery schedule ordering the submission 
of AAI’s expert disclosures by May 17, 2012 and completion of all discovery by July 17, 2012; he 

also admonished the parties to raise discovery disputes promptly.  (ECF No. 235 at 3).  Despite 
these instructions, on July 18, 2012, past the May 17, 2012 deadline, AAI attempted to submit a 
“reply expert report from Dr. Jinqing Fan” (the “Fan Reply”).  (Id. at 3–4; see ECF No. 226 at 121, 
146–49).  Defendants moved to strike the Fan Reply as untimely and not constituting “a proper 
‘reply,’ because it contained new information and opinions that were not within the scope of 
either parties’ prior expert disclosures.”  (ECF No. 235 at 4).  Judge Pitman granted Defendants’ 

motion to strike the Fan Reply (ECF No. 174), AAI objected, and on February 8, 2013, the 
Honorable Laura T. Swain, United States District Judge, terminated AAI’s objections pending 
Judge Pitman’s ruling on a pending motion for reconsideration (ECF No. 241).   
    The  parties  then  briefed  Defendants’  “motion  for  summary  judgment  and  their 

Rule 702/Daubert motion to exclude Dr. Fan’s initial report and testimony based on that report.”  
(ECF No. 235 at 5).  AAI’s “opposition to both motions included the Fourth Fan” Declaration (the 
“Fourth Fan Declaration”), which incorporated by reference and relied on the entire stricken Fan 
Reply.  (Id. at 6).  On June 10, 2013, Defendants requested a conference for their “anticipated 
motion to strike the Fourth Fan [Declaration] on the grounds that it was untimely and contained 

entirely new bases for AAI’s claims.”  (Id.)  On June 17, 2013, AAI requested a conference for its 
“anticipated motion for sanctions against defendants . . . based on allegations of discovery 
misconduct set forth in the Fourth Fan [Declaration].”  (Id.)  AAI sought to use the Fourth Fan 
Declaration in support of its motion for sanctions.  (Id. at 15).  On June 19, 2013, Judge Pitman 
“directed the parties to complete their briefing on Defendants’ motion to strike the Fourth Fan 
[Declaration] and . . . deferred consideration of AAI’s contemplated motion for sanctions until 

the dispute concerning the Fourth Fan [Declaration] was resolved.”  (Id. at 7).   
    On  July  10,  2013,  “pursuant  to  Rules 16, 26, and 37  of the  Federal Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure,” Defendants moved to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration, to “exclude Dr. Fan’s 2007 
Report and testimony concerning the opinions set forth in that report,” and for an award of “their 
expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred in connection with” the motion.  (ECF 
No. 235 at 1–2).                                                          

    In the March 2014 Order, Judge Pitman held that AAI was precluded from using the Fourth 
Fan Declaration to oppose Defendants’ motion summary judgment “or in connection with any 
other dispute involving the merits of the claims and defenses” because it was “untimely under 
[his] scheduling Order[,] was served in violation of Rule 26(a)(2),” and went “beyond Dr. Fan’s 
timely produced expert disclosures.”  (ECF No. 235 at 16, 23, 30–31).  Judge Pitman permitted 

AAI the limited use of “section G, ¶¶ 257–73” of the Fourth Fan Declaration only to respond to 
“Defendants’ rule 702/Daubert motion,” and                                
    [g]iven the age of this matter, the fact that the Fourth Fan [Declaration did] not 
    rely on information first produced after the close of discovery, [his] admonition in 
    January 2012 that discovery disputes be raised promptly and the almost year-long 
    gap between the close of discovery and the earliest date on which a sanctions 
    motion could possibly have been made,                                

he precluded AAI from using the Fourth Fan Declaration in support of its motion for sanctions.  
(Id. at 32, 34–36).  Finally, Judge Pitman found that Defendants were “entitled to recover some 
of their attorney’s fees and costs” from “AAI and its counsel,” but only half of “the fees and costs 
incurred in making” their motion “as a result of AAI’s failure to comply with the Scheduling Order 
and Rule 26(a)(2).”  (Id. at 36–37).                                      
    Judge Pitman ordered Defendants to submit their application for fees and costs within 
20 days of his order, with AAI’s response due 20 days thereafter.  (ECF No. 235 at 38).  Defendants 
timely  submitted  their  application  for  fees  and  costs  under  seal  requesting  an  award  of 
$91,246.55 (the “Fee Application”) (ECF No. 242), and AAI timely submitted a response under 
seal (ECF No. 246).                                                       
    On July 29, 2020, Defendants moved to redact the parties’ May 28, 2019 transcript (the 
“Motion to Redact”) to shield confidential material subject to the parties’ Stipulation and 
Protective Order Governing Confidential Material, dated March 14, 2005.  (See ECF Nos. 314, 
320–21, 330).  On August 12, 2019, AAI opposed the Motion to Redact.  (ECF No. 325).  On 
November 8, 2019, AAI requested that the Court defer ruling on the Fee Application and instead 
first investigate alleged collusion between its prior counsel, Mr. Todd S. Collins, (“Collins”) and 
Defendants’ counsel (“Motion to Defer”).  (ECF Nos. 366–7, 371).  On November 11, 2019, 

Defendants moved to require AAI’s preauthorization by the Court for future filings (“Motion for 
Preauthorization”) and to strike AAI’s Motion to Defer.  (ECF Nos. 369–70). 
    On November 12, 2019, the Court issued an order:  (1) granting Defendants’ Motion to 
Redact and striking AAI’s opposition; (2) denying AAI’s Motion to Defer and granting Defendants’ 
motion to strike the Motion to Defer; and (3) granting in part and denying in part Defendants’ 

Motion for Preauthorization, ordering that “[b]efore any party to this action may file any motion 
for any relief, including but not limited to discovery disputes, the party must” first hold a meet 
and confer and, “if the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, the party seeking to make a 
motion must file a Letter-Motion requesting a Local Civil Rule 37.2 Conference” (the “Case 
Management Order”).  (ECF No. 375).                                       
    On December 5, 2019, the Court granted Defendants’ Fee Application in part, ordering 

AAI to pay Defendants $57,270.91 in attorney’s fees (“First Award of Attorney’s Fees”).  (ECF No. 
389).    On  December  19,  2019,  AAI  filed  a  letter-motion  for  leave  to  file  a  motion  for 
reconsideration of both the Case Management Order and the First Award of Attorney’s Fees 
(“AAI’s First Request for Reconsideration”).  (ECF No. 394).  On December 27, 2019, Defendants 
filed their opposition (ECF No. 400), and AAI replied on January 2, 2020 (ECF No. 401).  On 
January 3, 2020, AAI filed a second letter-motion for leave to file a motion for reconsideration of 

the Case Management Order and First Award of Attorney’s Fees, with more focus on the Case 
Management Order (“AAI’s Second Request for Reconsideration”).  (ECF No. 402).  On January 3, 
2020, the Court held a Telephone Conference (the “January 3 Conference”) in which it granted 
AAI leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the Case Management Order and denied AAI’s 
request to stay payment of attorney’s fees as directed in the First Award of Attorney’s Fees.  (ECF 

No. 406).                                                                 
    On January 6, 2020, AAI filed a letter-motion directed to Judge Swain requesting a stay of 
the First Award of Attorney’s Fees, arguing that it was incorrect in part because the March 2014 
Order required that AAI and its former counsel be jointly responsible for the payment of the 
award (“AAI’s Motion to Stay”).  (ECF No. 407 at 2).  On January 8, 2020, this Court issued (1) an 

Amended Opinion & Order replacing the First Award of Attorney’s Fees (ECF No. 410) (the 
“Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees”), directing “AAI and its counsel” to reimburse Defendants’ 
attorney’s fees (id. at 15); and (2) an order staying the Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees 
“pending the Court’s consideration and ruling as to AAI’s anticipated motion for reconsideration” 
(“January Stay Order”) (ECF No. 409 at 2).  On January 9, 2020, Judge Swain denied AAI’s Motion 
to Stay as moot.  (ECF No. 414).                                          

    On January 8, 2020, Defendants filed their opposition to AAI’s Second Request for 
Reconsideration (ECF No. 411) and on January 9, 2020 AAI filed its reply (ECF No. 417).  During a 
Telephone Conference on January 15, 2020, the Court terminated AAI’s Second Request for 
Reconsideration  as  moot  given  AAI’s  confirmation  that  its  forthcoming  motion  for 
reconsideration would address both the Case Management Order and the Amended Award of 
Attorney’s Fees.  (ECF No. 420).                                          

    On January 17, 2020, AAI filed the Motion for Reconsideration.  (ECF No. 423).  On 
February 6, 2020, in support of its Motion for Reconsideration, AAI filed a redacted version of the 
Wang Declaration.  (ECF No. 426).  On February 7, 2020, Defendants filed their opposition to the 
Motion for Reconsideration.  (ECF No. 427).  On February 14, 2020, AAI filed its reply.  (ECF 
No. 428).    On  February  24,  2020,  Defendants filed Defendants’  Conference  Motion.    (ECF 

No. 429).  On February 27, 2020, AAI filed its opposition.  (ECF No. 430).  On February 28, 2020, 
Defendants filed their reply.  (ECF No. 431).  On March 30, 2020, the Court denied AAI’s request 
to file a sur-reply.  (ECF Nos. 432, 434).                                
                  II.  APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD                         
 A.  Motion for Reconsideration                                          

    Local  Civil  Rule  6.3  and  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  60(b)  govern  motions  for 
reconsideration.  Local Civil Rule 6.3 specifies timing, giving the moving party fourteen days after 
an entry of judgment to file a motion for reconsideration.  Local Civ. R. 6.3.  Rule 60(b) provides 
    On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative 
    from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:  (1) mistake, 
    inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that, 
    with reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a 
    new trial  under  Rule  59(b);  (3)  fraud  (whether  previously  called  intrinsic  or 
    extrinsic),  misrepresentation,  or  misconduct  by  an  opposing  party;  (4)  the 
    judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged; it is 
    based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it 
    prospectively is no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief. 

Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).                                                    
    Rule 60(b) affords “‘extraordinary judicial relief’” that “can be granted ‘only upon a 
showing of exceptional circumstances.’”  Kubicek v. Westchester Cty., No. 08 Civ. 372 (ER), 2014 
WL 4898479, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2014) (quoting Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 
1986)).  The reconsideration standard “is strict,” and reconsideration is generally only granted 
upon a showing of “controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked—matters, in other 
words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.”  Shrader 
v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995).                    
    A motion for reconsideration is not “an occasion for repeating old arguments previously 

rejected  nor  an  opportunity  for  making  new  arguments  that  could  have  been  previously 
advanced.”  Associated Press v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 395 F. Supp. 2d 17, 19 (S.D.N.Y. 2005).  It is not 
a way to “advance new facts, issues or arguments not previously presented to the Court.”  Polsby 
v. St. Martin’s Press, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 960 (MBM), 2000 WL 98057, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2000) 
(internal citation omitted).  The “moving party bears the burden of proof.”  Freedom, N.Y., Inc. v. 

United States, 438 F. Supp. 2d 457, 462 (S.D.N.Y. 2006).                  
    The decision to grant or deny a motion for reconsideration is “within ‘the sound discretion 
of the district court.’”  Premium Sports Inc. v. Connell, No. 10 Civ. 3753 (KBF), 2012 WL 2878085, 
at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 11, 2012) (quoting Aczel v. Labonia, 584 F.3d 52, 61 (2d Cir. 2009)).  
    In addition, the Court also has authority under Rule 54(b) “as well as the inherent power 
of the court, to reconsider a prior decision at any time before the entry of final judgment.”  

Richman v. W.L. Gore & Assocs., 988 F. Supp. 753, 755 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).  Rule 54(b) provides that  
    any order or other decision . . . that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the 
    rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any 
    of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a 
    judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities. 

Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).  Reconsideration is valid under Rule 54(b) when there is “an intervening 
change of controlling law,” new evidence becomes available, or reconsideration is needed to 
“correct a clear error or to prevent manifest injustice.”  Richman, 988 F. Supp. at 755.  Requests 
for relief under Rule 54(b) must be made within the time period specified in Local Civil Rule 6.3 
unless “justice so requires” a deviation.  Clinton v. Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc., 652 F. 
Supp. 2d 528, 530 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal citation omitted).            
                        III.  DISCUSSION                                 

 A.  AAI’s Motion for Reconsideration                                    
    To determine the merits of the Motion for Reconsideration, the Court must first assess 
whether it can properly consider the Wang Declaration (ECF No. 426), which AAI has submitted 
in support.                                                               
         1.  The Wang Declaration and Defendants’ Conference Motion      

    On  August  19,  2019,  The  American  Prospect  and  Brandon  Smith  (collectively,  the 
“Proposed Intervenors”) field a Motion to Intervene and Unseal Court Records (the “Motion to 
Intervene”).    (ECF  No.  328).    On  November  19,  2019,  in  light  of  discussions  among  AAI, 
Defendants, and Proposed Intervenors to determine whether they could resolve the Motion to 
Intervene without Court intervention, the Court ordered AAI and Defendants to work with the 
Proposed Intervenors to resolve the Motion to Intervene, and notify the Court if a resolution 

could not be reached.  (ECF No. 387).  The parties have been working since then to resolve the 
Motion to Intervene.  (See ECF Nos. 391, 395, 412–13, 424–25, 433, 435, 436–37). 
    On February 5, 2020, the parties wrote jointly to the Court regarding the status of their 
continued efforts.  (ECF No. 424).  The Proposed Intervenors sought a redacted version of “some 
or all of the remainder of the [Fourth] Fan Declaration, [ECF No. 219]” and “other court records.”  
(Id. at 1).  Only eight pages of the Fourth Fan Declaration had been provided to the Proposed 

Intervenors.  (Id.)  On February 6, 2020, the Court directed AAI and Defendants “to produce 
redacted versions of some or all of the remainder of the Fourth Fan Declaration, as well as other 
court records, to the Proposed Intervenors” (the “February 6 Order”).  (ECF No. 425).   
    AAI  argues  that  the  February  6  Order  granted  it  permission  to  include  the  Wang 

Declaration as support for its Motion for Reconsideration.  (ECF No. 430).  Defendants argue that 
the Wang Declaration should not be considered in analyzing the Motion for Reconsideration 
because AAI never served it on them and, contrary to AAI’s assertion, the February 6 Order, 
regarding the partial un-redaction of the Fourth Fan Declaration, did not give AAI the right to 
include the Wang Declaration as support for its Motion for Reconsideration.  (ECF No. 429).  

Defendants seek a conference concerning AAI’s use of the Wang Declaration to support its 
Motion for Reconsideration; to exclude its use; and to clarify the February 6 Order.  (Id.)   
    Sanctions for failure to comply with a court order are non-dispositive and within the 
Magistrate Judge’s Rule 72(a) authority, “unless the sanction employed disposes of a claim.”  
Seena Int’l Inc. v. One Step Up, Ltd., 15 Civ. No. 1095 (PKC) (BCM), 2016 WL 2865350, at *10 
(S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2016) (internal citation omitted).  “The critical issue . . . is what sanction the 

magistrate judge actually imposes, not what sanction the moving party seeks.”  Syntel Sterling 
Best Shores Mauritius Ltd. v. TriZetto Grp., 328 F.R.D. 100, 118 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (internal citation 
omitted).  Striking a pleading is a drastic sanction, generally used only when alternatives have 
been considered and the failure to comply was “due to willfulness, bad faith, or any fault of the 
party sanctioned.”  Pelgrift v. 355 W. 51st Tavern Inc., No. 14 Civ. 8934 (AJN), 2016 WL 817470, 
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2016) (internal citation omitted).               

    The “court has broad discretion to determine the type of sanction to impose upon a party, 
based on all the facts of the case.”  Scantibodies Lab., Inc. v. Church & Dwight Co., No. 14 Civ. 
2275 (JGK) (DF), 2016 WL 11271874, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 4, 2016) adopted by, 2017 WL 605303 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2017) (internal citation omitted).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) 
provides:                                                                 

    two  standards—one  general  and  one  specific—that  limit  a  district  court’s 
    discretion in determining which sanctions are appropriate.  First, any sanction 
    must be ‘just’; second, the sanction must be specifically related to the particular 
    ‘claim’ which was at issue in the order to provide discovery.  Thus, the Court must 
    select sanctions that are commensurate with the non-compliance such that they 
    restore the prejudiced party, as nearly as possible, to the position it would have 
    occupied had the discovery been produced and the evidence disclosed.   

Chevron Corp v. Donziger, 296 F.R.D. 168, 220 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal citation omitted). 
    In this Circuit, when determining which sanctions to impose, the district court considers 
the  following  four  non-exhaustive  and  non-exclusive  factors:    “(1)  the  willfulness  of  the 
noncompliant party or the reason for noncompliance; (2) the efficacy of lesser sanctions; (3) the 
duration of the period of noncompliance, and (4) whether the non-compliant party had been 
warned of the consequences of noncompliance.”  S. New England Tel. Co. v. Glob. NAPs Inc., 624 
F.3d 123, 144 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal citation omitted).  The court may also consider the full 
record in the case and any prejudice to the moving party.  Syntel Sterling Best Shores Mauritius 
Ltd., 328 F.R.D. at 120.  In analyzing prejudice to the moving party, “the Second Circuit has 
consistently rejected a ‘no harm, no foul’ standard for evaluating discovery sanctions.”  Id. 
(internal citation omitted).                                              
    In January 2012, Judge Pitman set a revised discovery schedule ordering the submission 
of AAI’s expert disclosures by May 17, 2012 and completion of all discovery by July 17, 2012; he 
also  admonished  the  parties  to  raise  discovery  disputes  promptly.    (ECF  No.  235  at  3).  
Subsequently, Judge Pitman struck the Fan Reply as untimely (ECF No. 174) and limited use of 
the Fourth Fan Declaration, in part because of its untimeliness (ECF No. 235).  The Wang 
Declaration is dated April 23, 2015—over three years after Judge Pitman ordered the completion 
of discovery.                                                             

    AAI’s argument that the February 6 Order granted it leave to file the untimely Wang 
Declaration eight years after the discovery deadline set by Judge Pitman is unavailing.  The 
February 6 Order was specific to the parties’ and Proposed Intervenors’ effort to minimize 
unnecessary motion practice and progress this case toward trial.  The February 6 Order directed 
the parties to “produce redacted versions of some or all of the remainder of the Fourth Fan 

Declaration, as well as other court records, to the Proposed Intervenors.”  (ECF No. 425 at 2).  To 
eliminate any ambiguity, the Court now clarifies that the “other court records” in the February 6 
Order  meant  the  documents  the  parties  and  the  Proposed  Intervenors  contemplated  for 
unsealing.  (See ECF Nos. 391, 395, 412–13, 424–25, 433, 435, 436–37).  The February 6 Order 
does not mention the Wang Declaration, and neither do any of the other filings related to the 
Proposed Intervenors’ collaborations with the parties to unseal documents on the docket.  

    Therefore, the Court has received the Wang Declaration and is aware of what it contains 
—AAI’s repeated allegations of collusion, analyzed and dismissed in detail below, infra III.A.3.a—
but has not relied on its substance in deciding the Motion for Reconsideration.  Accordingly, 
Defendants’ request to exclude the Wang Declaration is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. 
    Having ruled on all of the issues presented in Defendants’ Conference Motion, that 
Motion is DENIED.                                                         
         2.  Timeliness                                                  
    AAI moves for reconsideration pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and Local 
Civil Rule 6.3.  (ECF No. 423 at 5).  Defendants argue that AAI’s Motion for Reconsideration is 

untimely because Local Civil Rule 6.3 “requires that a motion for reconsideration be filed within 
fourteen days of the order at issue, [but AAI] waited nearly forty days before indicating its intent 
to seek reconsideration of the Case Management Order and nearly thirty days before indicating 
its intent to seek reconsideration of the [Amended Award of Attorney’s Fes].”  (ECF No. 427 at 
8).                                                                       

    The Case Management Order was filed on November 12, 2019 (ECF No. 375) and the First 
Award of Attorney’s Fees was filed on December 5, 2019 (ECF No. 389).  AAI’s First Request for 
Reconsideration was filed on December 19, 2019, making it untimely at more than five weeks 
after the Case Management Order, but timely at exactly two weeks after the First Award of 
Attorney’s Fees.  The Court amended the First Award for Attorney’s Fees with the Amended 
Award of Attorney’s Fees, filed on January 8, 2020, (ECF No. 410), and at the Court’s instruction, 

AAI filed its Motion for Reconsideration on January 17, 2020.  (ECF No. 423).   
    Although AAI was late in seeking reconsideration of the Case Management Order, the 
Court discussed and considered its request from December 19, 2019, when the First Request for 
Reconsideration was filed, through the January 15, 2020 conference, when AAI confirmed that 
the Motion for Reconsideration would encompass the Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees and 
Case Management Order.  (See ECF No. 420).                                

    Accordingly, the Court finds that AAI’s Motion for Reconsideration is not untimely (1) with 
regard to the Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees because it was timely filed two weeks after 
entry of that order, and (2) with regard to the Case Management Order because of the Court’s 
on-going consideration of its merits.                                     
         3.  Case Management Order                                       

              a.  Alleged Collusion                                      
    The principal theme of AAI’s Motion for Reconsideration is the allegation that Defendants’ 
counsel and AAI’s prior counsel, Collins, colluded such that essentially every decision in this case 
against AAI should be reconsidered.  (ECF No. 423 at 6).  AAI also requests that the Court order 
an investigation into the alleged collusion.  (Id.)                       

    Fact discovery in this case closed in September 2007.  (See ECF No 76).  Following Judge 
Swain’s adoption in part (ECF No. 124) of Judge Pitman’s Report & Recommendation (ECF No. 
112) granting in part Defendants’ first motion for summary judgment, discovery was partially 
reopened in 2010 to allow additional discovery regarding the development and testing of 
Defendants’ relevant sequences.  (See ECF No. 124 at 5–6).  After 18 months, on the eve of the 
“second close of discovery,” AAI sought further discovery.  (ECF No. 427 at 9).  Judge Pitman 

rejected AAI’s request, finding that AAI sought to “pursue a theory that [Defendants] produced 
fabricated evidence in discovery of which there seems to be really very, very little evidence, if 
any evidence.”  (ECF No. 175 at 94:17–20).  Judge Swain affirmed Judge Pitman’s ruling.  (ECF No. 
214).                                                                     
    In April 2013, Defendants filed a second motion for summary judgment.  (See ECF No. 
216).  AAI’s opposition allegedly attempted to “resuscitate” its unsuccessful arguments from 

2012, “principally relying on the Fourth [Fan Declaration].”  (ECF No. 427 at 10).  Defendants then 
moved to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration, which the March 2014 Order granted and awarded 
attorney’s fees as a sanction.  (ECF No. 235).  On May 31, 2017, Collins was then permitted to 
withdraw as AAI’s counsel.  (ECF Nos. 263, 275).                          
    On January 4 and May 31, 2017, Dr. Wang filed letters with the Court alleging that Collins 

colluded with Defendants’ counsel “to thwart [AAI’s] efforts to win its case, including ‘framing’ 
[AAI] for contempt by filing the Fourth Fan Decl[aration] for an improper purpose.” (ECF No. 427 
at 10).  In support of the collusion theory, Dr. Wang argued that Collins “and Defendants’ counsel 
jointly called Magistrate Judge Pitman to inform him that [AAI] intended to withdraw” a motion 
for sanctions.  (Id. at 11).  In granting Collins’ motion to withdraw, Judge Pitman noted that Dr. 

Wang’s claim failed to cite “any evidence, that [Collins] colluded with [D]efendants’ counsel to 
file deficient papers in opposition to [D]efendants’ motion for summary judgment.”  (ECF No. 275 
at 2).                                                                    
    After retaining new counsel, in July 2017, AAI filed a motion pursuant to Rule 56(d) (ECF 
No. 289), repeating the same “baseless allegation of discovery misconduct” contained it its 2012 
motion to compel discovery, the Fourth Fan Declaration, and 2017 letters alleging collusion—all 

of which Judge Pitman had considered and rejected.  (ECF No. 427 at 11).  Defendants moved to 
strike this new motion, citing the previously dismissed allegations (ECF No. 293), and Judge 
Pitman denied the motion, finding the allegations of discovery misconduct “were addressed in 
2012 and 2013 by both [him] and by Judge Swain.”  (ECF No. 381 at 13:20–23, 16:2–4, 53:23–
55:18).                                                                   
    On June 26, 2019, AAI moved pursuant to Rule 56(h) again alleging the same baseless 

allegations of collusion (ECF No. 313), which Judge Pitman denied on September 4, 2019.  
Advanced Analytics, Inc. v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts., No. 04 Civ. 3531 (LTS) (HBP), 2019 WL 4193941, 
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2019) (stating that AAI’s disagreements with Collins did not imply that 
Collins  colluded  with  Defendants’  counsel  and  finding  “no  basis  to  revisit”  AAI’s  rejected 
allegations  of  discovery  misconduct)  (the  “Sept.  2019  Report  &  Recommendation).    AAI’s 

objection to the Sept. 2019 Report & Recommendation is pending before Judge Swain.  (ECF No. 
361).                                                                     
    In its Motion for Reconsideration, AAI makes the same conclusory arguments that Collins’ 
collusion with Defendants’ counsel is the reason for AAI’s unsuccessful motions throughout this 
litigation.  (ECF No. 423 at 9–25, 27–29).  AAI attempts to (1) reintroduce the Fourth Fan 

Declaration, the use of which was previously limited by the March 2014 Order (ECF No. 235); and 
(2) introduce the Wang Declaration, the use of which the Court has denied here in part because 
of its untimeliness and reliance on AAI’s collusion allegations.  (See supra Section III.A.1).   
    A motion for reconsideration, however, is not “an occasion for repeating old arguments 
previously rejected . . .”  Associated Press, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 19.  Despite numerous rulings by 
Judge Swain and Judge Pitman, in this over 16-year-old case, rejecting AAI’s allegations of 

collusion, AAI fails to point to an intervening change in controlling law, new evidence that just 
became available, any showing that reconsideration is needed to correct clear error, or any 
showing that reconsideration is needed to prevent manifest injustice.  See  Richman, 988 F. Supp. 
at 755.  AAI has failed to point to any matter that the Court has overlooked over the last 16 years 
of litigation in this case or through its previous dismissals of AAI’s allegation of collusion that 
might reasonably be expected to alter any of the Court’s prior decisions.  Shrader, 70 F.3d at 257.  

Accordingly, AAI’s Motion for Reconsideration based on its alleged “3-Prong Scheme of collusion” 
is DENIED.                                                                
              b.  Preauthorization                                       
    AAI asks the Court to reconsider the portion of the Case Management Order requiring the 
parties to meet and confer, then seek a pre-motion conference with the Court before filing 

requests for relief.  (ECF No. 423 at 5).                                 
    “A district judge may refer to a magistrate judge for determination any matter that does 
not dispose of a charge or defense,” including pretrial and discovery management.  Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 59; 28 U.S.C. § 636.  A “district court may order the parties to appear at a pretrial conference 
in order to ‘discourag[e] wasteful pretrial activities.’”  Youssef v. Halcrow, Inc., No. 11 Civ. 2283 

(PKC), 2011 WL 2693527, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(a)(3)).  “At any 
pretrial conference, the court may consider and take appropriate action on . . . formulating and 
simplifying the issues, and eliminating frivolous claims or defenses.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(c)(2)(A).  
The Second Circuit has noted that, while “it is within the judge’s discretion to hold a pre-motion 
conference for the purpose of persuading a party not to file a perceived meritless motion, . . . the 
judge may not require that the court’s permission be secured at such a conference before a party 

may file its motion” because a court has no power to prevent a party from filing motions 
authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”   Eisemann v. Greene, 204 F.3d 393, 397 (2d 
Cir. 2000) (internal citation omitted).                                   
    During the January 3 Conference, the Court granted AAI leave to file the Motion for 
Reconsideration, noting that AAI could not be precluded from filing its motion (ECF No. 415 at 
10), and AAI filed its Motion for Reconsideration on January 17, 2020 (ECF No. 423).  

    AAI argues that the Court struck down its Motion to Defer without first giving AAI an 
opportunity to respond to Defendants’ Motion for Preauthorization and to strike the Motion to 
Defer.  (ECF No. 423 at 30–31).  AAI takes this opportunity to spin this argument into another 
collusion allegation against Defendants.  (Id. at 31–33).  The Court, in the January Stay Order, 
ultimately granted AAI’s Motion to Defer, staying the Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees pending 

a  decision  regarding  AAI’s  Motion  for  Reconsideration,  and  Defendants’  Motion  for 
Preauthorization was denied as noted in the January 3 Conference.  Accordingly, the portion of 
the Motion for Reconsideration requesting reconsideration of the Motion for Preauthorization is 
DENIED as moot.                                                           
         4.  Award of Attorney's Fees                                    

    AAI asks the Court to reconsider the entire Award for Attorney’s fees because it is based 
on the March 2014 Order, to which AAI objected (ECF No. 361) and is currently pending before 
Judge Swain.  (ECF No. 423 at 5).  AAI again posits that its main reason for the requested deferral 
is to permit Judge Swain to investigate the alleged collusion.  (Id. at 33).  AAI also argues that 
Collins and his firm, not AAI, should be responsible for the payment of the fees because of the 
collusion.  (Id.)                                                         

    Defendants argue that the Motion for Reconsideration erroneously “focuses not on the 
mathematical calculation of fees—which the Court has explained was the sole function in issuing 
the [Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees]—but on the question of whether [the March 2014 
Order awarding] fees to Defendants nearly six years ago was proper.”  (ECF No. 427 at 8). 
    A party and its counsel can be held liable for attorney’s fees and costs incurred for 
violating the court’s scheduling orders or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a).  Fed. R. Civ. 

P. 16(f), 37(c)(1).  Under Rule 16(f)(2), “in addition to or instead of sanctions, the court may award 
‘reasonable expenses—including attorney’s fees—incurred because of [any] noncompliance with 
this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other circumstances made an 
award of expenses unjust.’”  Tessemae’s LLC v. Atlantis Capital LLC, No. 18 Civ. 4902 (KHP), 2019 
WL 2635956, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 2019) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f)(2)).  Under the law of 

this Circuit, identical language in Rule 37 imposes on the disobedient party the “burden to show 
that his failure is justified or that special circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.”  Id. 
at  *3  (internal  citation  omitted).    The  prevailing  party  is  also  entitled  to  costs,  including 
“reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred  by  attorneys  and  ordinarily  charged  to  their 
clients.”  Kreisler v. Second Avenue Diner Corp., No. 10 Civ. 7592 (RJS), 2013 WL 3965247, at *2 

(S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2013) (internal citation omitted).                     
    The district court has broad discretion to determine the amount to be awarded.  Vincent 
v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 651 F.3d 299, 307 (2d Cir. 2011).  In Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens 
Neighborhood Ass’n. v. Cty. of Albany, 522 F.3d 182 (2d Cir. 2008), the Second Circuit articulated 
the method for calculating reasonable attorney’s fees:  a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by a 
reasonable number of hours extended on the work.  Kreisler, 2013 WL 3965247, at *1.  The court 

may reduce the hours spent on the litigation to exclude excessive, redundant, or otherwise 
unnecessary time.  Kirsch v. Fleet St., Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 173 (2d Cir. 1998).  
    In the Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees, which amended the scrivener’s error AAI 
highlighted regarding its joint liability with its former counsel, the Court awarded payment to 
Defendants in accordance with the law as detailed above.  AAI fails to point to an intervening 
change in controlling law, new evidence that recently became available, any showing that 

reconsideration is needed to correct clear error, or any showing that reconsideration is needed 
to prevent manifest injustice.  Richman, 988 F. Supp. at 755.  AAI has failed to point to any matter 
that the Court overlooked in the Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees.  Shrader, 70 F.3d at 257.   
    Accordingly, and because the Court has already rejected AAI’s collusion allegations, see 

supra Section III.A.3.a, the portion of the Motion for Reconsideration with respect to the 
Amended Award of Attorney’s Fees is DENIED.                               
 B.  The Parties’ Requests for Fees and Costs                            
    AAI requests costs for opposing Defendants’ “frivolous motions filed in bad faith” and for 
bringing the Motion for Reconsideration.  (ECF No. 428 at 14).  Defendants assert that the Court 

should issue sanctions against AAI and its counsel for a “course of conduct [that] establishes that 
denial of its requests alone will not deter the repeated filing of motions with the same groundless 
claims  or,  consequently,  the  need  for  Defendants  to  continue  incurring  the  expense  of 
responding to [AAI’s] frivolous requests.”  (ECF No. 427 at 8, 28–30).    
    By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether 
    by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented 
    party certifies that to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, 
    formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:  (1) it is not being 
    presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, 
    or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.                       

Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1).  “Once a court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, it may in its 
discretion impose sanctions limited to what is ‘sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct.’”  
Margo v. Weiss, 213 F.3d 55, 64 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2)).  “Sanctions serve 
three purposes:  (1) to prevent a party from benefitting from its own improper conduct, (2) to 
provide specific deterrents, and (3) to provide general deterrence.”  Kensington Int’l. Ltd. v. 
Republic of Congo, No. 03 Civ. 4578 (LAP), 2007 WL 2456993 at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2007).   
    The Court should consider whether:                                   
    the improper conduct was willful, or negligent; whether it was part of a pattern of 
    activity, or an isolated event; whether it infected the entire pleading, or only one 
    particular count or defense; whether the person has engaged in similar conduct in 
    other litigation; whether it was intended to injure; what effect it had on the 
    litigation process in time or expense; whether the responsible person is trained in 
    the law; what amount, given the financial resources of the responsible person, is 
    needed to deter that person from repetition in the same case; what amount is 
    needed to deter similar activity by other litigants . . .            

Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 Advisory Comm. Notes (1993 amendments).  Because Rule 11 sanctions are 
meant to “deter rather than to compensate, the rule provides that, if a monetary sanction is 
imposed, it should ordinarily be paid into court as a penalty.”  Id.      
    This is a 16 year-old case, involving complex and technical underlying facts, voluminous 
motion practice, a pending motion to intervene to unseal numerous sealed documents, and 
pending  objections  to  various  orders.    During  the  pendency  of  this  case,  AAI  has  been 
represented by several different counsel and repeats the same allegations of collusion through 
motion practice, in declarations, and through objections to orders dismissing its filings.   
    The Court’s review of the factors identified in the Rule 11 Advisory Committee Notes 
demonstrates, however, that neither party’s request for monetary sanctions should be granted.  
First, the parties request that their counsels’ fees and costs be paid, but Rule 11 is meant to deter, 
not compensate.  Although AAI repeats the same arguments, the Court recognizes that its 
multiple counsel changes (approaching double digits) may have contributed to its repetitive 
filings.  In addition, even after having been sanctioned to pay fees and costs (see Amended Award 
of  Attorney’s  Fees  and  March  2014  Order),  dismissal  of  multiple  meritless  motions,  and 
discussions with the Court about the possible futility of its motions, AAI continues to diligently 
file papers making the same collusion arguments.  As discussed, supra III.A.3.b, the Court cannot 
stop AAI from filing motions it has a right to file. 
      AAl’s arguments against Defendants for costs for defending against Defendants’ allegedly 
frivolous  motions and  for  having to  file  the  Motion  for  Reconsideration  fair  no  better.  As 
discussed above, the Motion for Reconsideration is denied and, in the interest of clarity and 
justice, neither side is entitled to fees or costs.  The parties are encouraged to move this case to 
a close, on the merits, rather than continuing to file ancillary pleadings.  Accordingly, the parties’ 
motions for fees and costs are DENIED. 
                             IV.    CONCLUSION 
      For the reasons set forth above, (1) AAl’s Motion for Reconsideration (ECF No. 423) is 
DENIED, (2) Defendants’ request to exclude the Wang Declaration (ECF No. 429) is GRANTED IN 
PART AND DENIED IN PART, (3) the parties’ requests for costs and fees (ECF Nos. 427-28) are 
DENIED, (4) and Defendants’ Conference Motion (ECF No. 429) is DENIED.  The Court’s award of 
attorney’s fees to Defendants (ECF No. 410) stands and must be paid by AAI and its counsel within 
60 days of the date of this Order. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close ECF Nos. 423 
and 429, and unseal ECF No. 366.

SARAH L. CAVE, United States Magistrate Judge.                            

Before the Court is the application of Defendants Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Yield 
Book, Inc. (“Defendants”) for an Award of Expenses Pursuant to the Court’s Partial Grant of 
Motion to Strike the Fourth Declaration of Jianqing Fan (the “Application”).  (ECF No. 242).  For 
the reasons set forth below, Defendants’ Application is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. 
                      BACKGROUND                                     
Given this action’s lengthy history, the Court assumes the reader’s familiarity with the 
background  of  this  case  and  references  only  facts  necessary  to  explain  this  opinion.    A 
comprehensive recitation of the events giving rise to this action is set forth in the Honorable 
Henry B. Pitman’s Opinion and Order dated March 26, 2014 granting Defendants’ motion for 
expenses.  (ECF No. 235).                                                 
This action has been pending for over fifteen years and stems from the allegations of 
Advanced Analytics, Inc. (“AAI”) that Defendants misappropriated AAI’s sequences of numbers 
used to aid in pricing mortgage-backed securities and incorporated them into Defendants’ 
software, the Yield Book, or used them to create new sequences for use in the Yield Book.  (ECF 
No. 235 at 3).  In January 2012, Magistrate Judge Pitman set a revised discovery schedule ordering 
the submission of AAI’s expert disclosures by May 17, 2012 and completion of all discovery by 
July 17, 2012; he also admonished the parties to raise discovery disputes promptly.  (Id.).  Despite 

these instructions, on July 18, 2012, AAI attempted to submit a “reply expert report from Dr. 
Jinqing Fan,” past the May 17, 2012 deadline (the “Fan Reply”).  (Id. at 3–4).  (See July 18, 2012 
Disc. Conf. Tr., ECF No. 226 at 121, 146–49).  Defendants moved to strike the Fan Reply as 
untimely and not constituting “a proper ‘reply,’ because it contained new information and 
opinions that were not within the scope of either parties’ prior expert disclosures.”  (Id. at 4).  

Magistrate Judge Pitman issued an Order granting Defendants’ motion (ECF No. 174), AAI 
objected, and on February 8, 2013, the Honorable Laura T. Swain, United States District Judge, 
overruled AAI’s objections.  (ECF No. 214).                               
The parties then briefed Defendants’ “motion for summary judgment and their Rule 
702/Daubert motion to exclude Dr. Fan’s initial report and testimony based on that report.”  (ECF 
No. 235 at 5).  AAI’s “opposition to both motions included the Fourth Fan” Declaration, which 

incorporated by reference and relied on the entire previously stricken Fan Reply (the “Fourth Fan 
Declaration”).  (Id.at 6).  On June 10, 2013, Defendants requested a conference for their 
“anticipated motion to strike the Fourth Fan [Declaration] on the grounds that it was untimely 
and contained entirely new bases for AAI’s claims.”  (Id.).  On June 17, 2013, AAI requested a 
conference for its “anticipated motion for sanctions against defendants . . . based on allegations 
of discovery misconduct set forth in the Fourth Fan [Declaration].”  (Id.).  AAI sought to use the 

Fourth Fan Declaration in support of its motion for sanctions.  (Id. at 15).  On June 19, 2013, 
Magistrate Judge Pitman “directed the parties to complete their briefing on Defendants’ motion 
to strike the Fourth Fan [Declaration] and . . . deferred consideration of AAI’s contemplated 
motion for sanctions until the dispute concerning the Fourth Fan [Declaration] was resolved.”  
(Id. at 7).                                                               

On  July  10,  2013,  “pursuant  to  Rules 16, 26, and 37  of the  Federal Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure,” Defendants moved to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration, to “exclude Dr. Fan’s 2007 
Report and testimony concerning the opinions set forth in that report,” and for an award of “their 
expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred in connection with” the motion.  (ECF No. 
235 at 1–2).                                                              

On March 26, 2014, Magistrate Judge Pitman held that AAI was precluded from using the 
Fourth Fan Declaration to oppose Defendants’ motion summary judgment “or in connection with 
any other dispute involving the merits of the claims and defenses” because it was “untimely 
under [his] scheduling Order and was served in violation of Rule 26(a)(2),” and went “beyond Dr. 
Fan’s timely produced expert disclosures.”  (ECF No. 235 at 16, 23, 30–31).  Magistrate Judge 
Pitman also held that AAI could use “section G, ¶¶ 257–73” of the Fourth Fan Declaration to 

respond to “Defendants’ rule 702/Daubert motion,” but “[g]iven the age of this matter, the fact 
that the Fourth Fan [Declaration] does not rely on information first produced after the close of 
discovery, [his] admonition in January 2012 that discovery disputes be raised promptly and the 
almost year-long gap between the close of discovery and the earliest date on which a sanctions 
motion could possibly have been made,” AAI could not use the Fourth Fan Declaration in support 
of its motion for sanctions.  (Id. at 32, 34, 36).  Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Pitman found that 

Defendants are “entitled to recover some of their attorney’s fees and costs” from “AAI and its 
counsel,” but only half of “the fees and costs incurred in making” their motion “as a result of 
AAI’s failure to comply with the Scheduling Order and Rule 26(a)(2).”  (Id. at 36–37). 
Magistrate Judge Pitman ordered Defendants to submit their Application within 20 days 

of his order with AAI’s response due 20 days thereafter.  (ECF No. 235 at 38).  Defendants timely 
submitted their Application under seal requesting an award of $91,246.55 (ECF No. 242 ¶6), and 
AAI timely submitted their response under seal.  (ECF No. 246).           
                     LEGAL STANDARD                                  
A party and its counsel can be held liable for attorney’s fees and costs incurred for 

violating the court’s scheduling order or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a).  Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f), 
37(c)(1).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(f)(2), “in addition to or instead of sanctions, 
the court may award ‘reasonable expenses — including attorney’s fees — incurred because of 
noncompliance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other 
circumstances made an award of expenses unjust.’”  Tessemae’s LLC v. Atlantis Capital LLC, No. 
18 Civ. 4902 (KHP), 2019 WL 2635956, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 2019) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. 

P. 16(f)(2)).  Under the law of this Circuit, identical language in Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure imposes on the disobedient party the “burden to show that his failure is justified 
or that special circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.”  Id. at *3 (internal citation 
omitted).  The prevailing party is also entitled to costs, including “reasonable out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by attorneys and ordinarily charged to their clients.”  Kreisler v. Second 
Avenue Diner Corp., No. 10 Civ. 7592 RJS), 2013 WL 3965247, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2013) 

(internal citation omitted).                                              
The district court has broad discretion to determine the amount to be awarded.  Vincent 
v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 651 F.3d 299, 307 (2d Cir. 2011).  In Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens 
Neighborhood Ass’n. v. Cnty. of Albany, 522 F.3d 182 (2d Cir. 2008), the Second Circuit articulated 

the method for calculating reasonable attorney’s fees:  a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by a 
reasonable number of hours extended on the work constitutes the “presumptively reasonable 
fee,” also known as the “lodestar.”  Kreisler, 2013 WL 3965247, at *1.  A court using the lodestar 
method sets the lodestar, then considers “whether, in light of variables such as the difficulty of 
the case, it should adjust the lodestar before settling on the reasonable fee.”  Arbor Hill, 522 F.3d 

at 187.                                                                   
To aid in the court’s analysis, a fee application should be supported by “contemporaneous 
time records” relaying the rates charged and hours worked by each attorney.  N.Y. State Ass’n 
for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1154 (2d Cir. 1983).  The attorneys “should 
maintain billing time records in a manner that will enable a reviewing court to identify distinct 
claims.”  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983); see Themis Capital v. Democratic 

Republic of Congo, No. 09 Civ. 1652 (PAE), 2014 WL 4379100, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2014) 
(reducing hours by twenty percent for “impermissibly broad” block billing).  A court should look 
at the “nature of the legal matter and context of the fee award in considering the reasonable rate 
and reasonable time spent on the matter.”  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *3.    
To determine the hourly rate, a court considers “what a reasonable, paying client would 
be willing to pay, given that such a party wishes to spend the minimum necessary to litigate the 

case effectively.”  Bergerson v. N.Y. State Office of Mental Health, Cent. N.Y. Psychiatric Ctr., 652 
F.3d 277, 289–90 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal citation omitted).  In addition, the Second Circuit has a 
“forum rule” requiring the use of “hourly rates employed in the district in which the reviewing 
court sits in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee.”  Id. at 289 (internal citation omitted).  
The court’s determination of the reasonable hourly rate is aided by the rate “prevailing in the 

community  for  similar services  by  lawyers  of reasonably  comparable  skill,  experience and 
reputation.”  Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n.11 (1984).  “Courts in this District have 
determined that hourly rates ranging from $250 to $1,260 per hour, for attorneys’ work on a 
commercial litigation matter were reasonable” depending on complexity, experience, and skill 
required.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *4 (collecting cases).  The court may adjust base 

hourly rates to account for case specific variables such as the complexity of the issues and 
attorneys’ experiences.  See MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co. Holding S.A. v. Forsyth Kowancki 
LLC, No. 16 Civ. 8103 (LGS), 2017 WL 1194372, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2017) (adjusting fees based 
on case specific matters).                                                
To determine the reasonable number of hours worked, the court should strike a balance 
“between principles of thoroughness and efficiency.”  LCS Grp. LLC v. Shire LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 

274, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  The court must examine the amount of time spent on each task and 
decide “how much of that time was reasonably expended given the scope and complexity of the 
litigation.”  Pichardo v. C.R. Bard, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 7653 (SHS), 2015 WL 13784565, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 
Jan. 26, 2015) (internal citation omitted).  The court should also consider the number of attorneys 
involved.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5.  The court can rely on “its own familiarity 
with the case, as well as its experience with the parties’ evidentiary submissions and arguments.”  

Kreisler, 2013 WL 3965247, at *3.  Time spent preparing a fee application may be awarded.  See 
Dorchester Fin. Holdings Corp. v. Banco BRJ, S.A., No. 11 Civ. 1529 (KMW) (KNF), 2015 WL 
1062327, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2015).                                   
The court may reduce the hours spent on the litigation to exclude excessive, redundant, 

or otherwise unnecessary time.  Kirsch v. Fleet St., Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 173 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing 
Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434); see LCS Grp. LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d at 281 (“A court may apply an across-
the-board reduction to effectuate the reasonable imposition of fees.”); see MSC Mediterranean 
Shipping Co. Holding S.A., 2017 WL 1194372, at *3 (reducing fees for an unopposed motion for 
default judgment in a breach of contract case; excluding a senior partner’s time because “the 

matter did not warrant the involvement of two senior partners”; and cutting paralegal’s time in 
half); see also Pichardo, 2015 WL 13784565, at *7 (reducing attorneys’ hours by forty percent 
because the recorded time addressed only one relevant issue).             
Ultimately, “[t]he essential goal in shifting fess (to either party) is to do rough justice, not 
to achieve auditing perfection.”  Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 838 (2011).  
                       DISCUSSION                                    

    I.  Determining the Aggregate Amount                             

In the Application, Defendants request an “aggregate amount of $182,493.09 of fees . . . 
incurred by Defendants ‘as a result of AAI’s failure to comply with the Scheduling Order and Rule 
26(a)(2).”  (ECF No. 242 ¶6) (quoting Magistrate Judge Pitman’s Mar. 26, 2014 Order at ECF No. 
235.)  They argue they are “entitled to reimbursement of one-half of this amount, or $91,246.55.”  
(Id.).  Defendants split their aggregate fees into four categories:  time spent (i) preparing and 
filing their motion to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration and reply in support of the motion; (ii) 
corresponding with the Court about their anticipated motion to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration 
and  associated  briefing  schedule,  and  preparing  an  opposition  to  AAI’s  motion  for 
reconsideration of the briefing schedule; (iii) redacting and performing other review and analysis 
of the Fourth Fan Declaration; and (iv) preparing the Application.  (Id. at 2–4).  Defendants attach 

corresponding diary entries as exhibits detailing each individual timekeeper’s work in that 
category.  (Id. Exs. A–D).                                                
AAI requests that the Court deduct $12,663.59 incurred in “Redacting and Performing 
Other Review and Analysis of the Fourth Fan [Declaration].”  (ECF No. 246 at 4).  AAI argues that 
Section G of the Fourth Fan Declaration, the section that Magistrate Judge Pitman permitted AAI 

use in its opposition to Defendants’ “Rule 702/Daubert motion,” referenced and can only be 
understood in conjunction with other sections of the Fourth Fan Declaration.  (ECF No. 246).  
Therefore, Defendants had to “address virtually the entirety” of the Fourth Fan Declaration in 
connection  with  that  motion,  negating  the  fees  and  costs  associated  with  “analyzing  or 
redacting” the same document.  (Id. at 3).  AAI also argues that Defendants needed to “analyze 
and redact” the Fourth Fan Declaration “notwithstanding, the Order’s direction that [it] may not 

be used for merits purposes on Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.”  (Id. at 4).  AAI’s 
argument is unpersuasive because Defendants were awarded attorney’s fees as a sanction 
against AAI for its failure to comply, not as compensation to their attorneys for services rendered.  
Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5.                                   
The Court does, however, reduce the aggregate amount of Defendants’ fees based on its 
familiarity with this litigation, review of the record, and to effectuate the reasonable imposition 

of fees.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5; LCS Grp. LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d at 281.  
Magistrate Judge Pitman found that Defendants are entitled to recover half of “the fees and costs 
incurred in making” their motion.  (ECF No. 235 at 36).  Later in the same order, he wrote that 
Defendants shall be reimbursed for one-half of expenses incurred “as a result of AAI’s failure to 
comply with the Scheduling Order and Rule 26(a)(2).”  (Id. at 37).  Defendants argue these phrases 

mean that AAI should reimburse them for fees and expenses beyond what was expended for the 
motion.  The Court does not interpret Magistrate Judge Pitman’s statement the same way, 
particularly because in the following sentence, he directed “Defendants’ counsel to submit a 
sworn statement, with supporting documentation, regarding the costs and fees associated with 
the present motion and justifying the hourly rates.”  (Id.) (emphasis added).  Therefore, only the 

costs and fees associated with the motion for expenses, not all expenses and fees associated with 
AAI’s failure, should be included in the aggregate number to be used as a starting point.   
Defendants seem to recognize this limit because, in a footnote, they state that if “the 
Court  intended  to  limit  Defendants’  recovery to  one-half  of  all  expenses  incurred  only  in 
connection with making the motion to strike . . . then the Defendants would be entitled to 
recover” $51,879.94, “which excludes work done in reviewing the Fourth Fan Declaration, 

apprising the Court of the intended Motion to Strike and negotiating a briefing schedule, and 
preparing the instant fee application.”  (ECF No. 242 at 6 n.4).          
Accordingly, the Court finds that as a starting point, Defendants are entitled to, at most, 
one-half of the $103,759.88 attorney’s fees and costs incurred in preparing and filing their motion 
to strike and reply in support of the motion.  Vincent, 651 F.3d at 307.  In addition, as a corollary 
to their motion to strike and reply in support, the Court also finds that as a starting point, 

Defendants are entitled to, at most, one-half of the $11,542.58 attorney’s fees and costs incurred 
in preparing the Application.  Dorchester Fin. Holdings Corp., 2015 WL 1062327, at *3. 
    II.  Hourly Rates                                                

Defendants’ counsel, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP (“Cleary”), states that the fees 
from June 2013 through August 2013 were invoiced to Defendants and paid in full.  (ECF No. 242 
at 4).  Cleary argues that its hourly rates are “customary for the legal market in which [it] serves 
its clients, including Defendants.”  (Id.).  Cleary also provides that it discounted the bill by fifteen 
percent.  (Id.).  Cleary submitted contemporaneous time records, describing each timekeeper’s 
task, the date of the specified task, and the time expended on each task.  (Id., Exs. A, D).   
Specific to preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion, Cleary lists 

ten timekeepers:  (i) two partners, Christopher Moore at $810 per hour and Jennifer Kennedy 
Park at $725 per hour; (ii) one managing attorney, Richard Conza at $605 per hour; (iii) five 
associates, Nathaniel Jedrey at $475 per hour; and Nicholas Fung, Jennifer McArdle, Catherine 
Gordley, and Michelle Parthum, each at $425 per hour; (iv) one unnamed paralegal at an 
apparent hourly rate of $205.42 (based on fees incurred of $5,484.68 for 26.7 hours); and (v) one 
unnamed non-legal personnel1 at an apparent hourly rate of $141.35 (based on fees incurred of 

$381.65 for 2.7 hours ).  (ECF No. 242 at 2, 5).                          
Specific to preparing the Application, Cleary lists seven timekeepers:  (i) three partners: 
Moore, Park, and Lawrence B. Friedman at $940 per hour; (ii) one knowledge management 
attorney, Sheila Kane at $605 per hour; (iii) two associates, Jedrey and Parthum; and (iv) one 
unnamed paralegal at an apparent hourly rate of $181.41 (based on fees incurred of $2,122.45 
for 11.7 hours).  (ECF No. 242 at 4–5).                                   


1 Cleary notes that non-legal personnel “include litigation technology specialists and assistant managing 
clerks.”  (ECF No. 242 at 2 n.2).                                         
For all of the work listed in the Application, Cleary lists six paralegals billed at hourly rates 
of $280, $275, $265, $230, and two at $210 each, and four non-legal personnel billed at hourly 
rates of $260, $150, and two at $140 each.  (ECF No. 242 at 5).  The unnamed paralegal used in 

preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion appears to be an aggregate of 
Michelle Barras at $265 per hour, Benazir Rozan at $275 per hour, Shanaz Muztaza at $210 per 
hour, and Roxenna Reyes-Seri at $280 per hour.  (Compare ECF Nos. 242 at 5 with 242, Ex. A).  
The non-legal personnel used in preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion 
appears to be an aggregate of Michael Ahn at $140 per hour, Aleksandr Abelev at $260 per hour, 

and Alison Wrynn at $150 per hour.  (Id.).  The unnamed paralegal used in preparing the 
Application appears to be an aggregate of Katie Shragge at $210 per hour and Samuel Racker at 
$230 per hour.  (Compare ECF Nos. 242 at 5 with 242, Ex. D).  Because the specified fees provided 
for the paralegals and non-legal personnel are an aggregate, the Court will use its calculated 
hourly rates of $205.42, $141.35, and $181.41, respectively.  See MSC Mediterranean Shipping 
Co. Holding S.A., 2017 WL 1194372, at *3 (finding that, in its discretion, the court can adjust 

hourly rates).                                                            
Pursuant to the Second Circuit’s forum rule, the hourly rates set for the attorneys and 
staff appear reasonable at a range of $725 to $940 for partners; $425 to $605 for non-partner 
attorneys; and $141.35 to $205.42 for paralegals and non-legal personnel.  See Tessemae’s LLC, 
2019 WL 2635956, at *4 (collecting cases).  Cleary did not provide information regarding the 
attorneys’ experiences, but the Court has discretion to rely on its own familiarity with the case 

and the parties’ expertise.  See Kreisler, 2013 WL 3965247, at *3.  Cleary is a well-regarded firm 
known  for  its  expertise  in  commercial  litigation.    Cleary  Gottlieb, 
https://www.clearygottlieb.com/practice-landing/litigation-and-arbitration (last visited Dec. 3, 
2019).  This case has a fifteen-year history, involving considerable motion practice, and involves 
complex issues regarding software and trade secrets.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Cleary’s 

hourly rates are reasonable.                                              
   III.  Number of Hours                                             

          A.   Motion to strike and reply                            
Specific to preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion, Cleary 
allocates an aggregate of 241.5 hours as follows:  (i) 63.1 hours by partners Moore at $810 per 
hour and Park at $725 per hour for fees incurred of $41,931.66; (ii) 1.4 hours by managing 
attorney Conza at $605 per hour for fees incurred of $719.95; (iii) 147.6 hours by associates 
Jedrey at $475 per hour, and Fung, McArdle, Gordley, and Parthum each at $425 per hour each 
for fees incurred of $55,003.80; (iv) 26.7 hours by an unnamed paralegal at $205.42 per hour for 
fees incurred of $5,484.68; (v) 2.7 hours by an unnamed non-legal personnel at $141.35 per hour 
for fees incurred of $381.65; and (vi) expenses of $238.14.2  (ECF No. 242 at 2, 5).  AAI argues 
that Defendants’ 241.5 hours spent preparing their motion to strike and reply in support of the 
motion are excessive.  (ECF No. 246 at 5).  AAI argues that the “charges listed are excessive,” 

particularly charging $41,931.66 in partner time for preparing and filing the motion to strike and 
reply brief, constituting “43.2 percent of the combined partner-associate charge of $96,935.46.”  
(Id. at 4).                                                               



2 Defendants note that the “referenced expenses were incurred in the duplication of documents.”  (ECF 
No. 242 at 3 n.3).                                                        
Cleary’s eleven-page exhibit detailing each timekeeper’s tasks for the motion to strike and 
reply in support of the motion is thorough.  (ECF No. 242, Ex. A).  All the time recorded preparing 
the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion was between June 19, 2013, when 

Magistrate Judge Pitman ordered the parties to finish briefing the motion, and August 9, 2013, 
when Defendants filed their certificates of service for their motion and reply.  (ECF Nos. 242, Ex. 
A; 234; 235 at 7).  The Court disagrees with AAI’s contention that the 241.5 hours spent over a 
seven-week period (less than 35 hours per week) preparing the motion to strike and reply in 
support of the motion are excessive.  Again, this is a complex case with over fifteen years of 

history.  Considerable time was reasonably necessary to craft Defendants’ motion to strike and 
reply to AAI’s formidable opposition.  See Pichardo, 2015 WL 13784565, at *4.  In addition, 
although  Defendants  did  incur  $41,931.66  in  partner  fees,  that  amount  only  constitutes 
63.1 hours, or 26.13%, of the total time spent preparing the motion and reply.  The Court has 
already found the partners’ rates reasonable, so the fees incurred at those rates are reasonable 
because the work was relevant and not excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.  Kirsch, 

148 F.3d at 173.  The Court also finds that it was reasonable for ten timekeepers to be involved 
in preparing Defendants’ filings, given the complexities of this litigation.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 
WL 2635956, at *5.                                                        
Defendants state that “certain items in the diary entries have been redacted on the basis 
of attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine” and offer to make unredacted 
entries available for in camera review.  (ECF No. 242 at 2 n.1).  The Court does not find that 

necessary because despite the redactions, the amount of time spent on each task is reasonable 
given the complexity and length of the litigation, with one exception.  See Pichardo, 2015 WL 
13784565, at *4.  First, Defendants charge 1.1 hours to associate Jedrey on August 6, 2013 but 
redact the entire description.  (ECF No. 242 Ex. A at 9).  The Court cannot award undescribed fees.  
The Court does not deem further in camera review of one entry totaling a $522.50 (Jedrey’s $475 

rate X 1.1 hours) deduction necessary in this already-protracted litigation.  Therefore, the Court 
deducts $522.50 from Cleary’s fees for preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the 
motion.  In addition, while the Court has discretion to award associated expenses, the Court 
declines to award $238.14 in expenses for duplicating documents.  (See ECF No. 242 at 2).  Cleary 
does not specify the reason for the duplication so the Court cannot find it reasonable. 

Accordingly, for preparing and filing the motion to strike and reply in support of the 
motion, Defendants are awarded $51,499.62.3 .                             
     B.   Preparing the Application                                  
Specific to preparing the Application, Cleary allocates an aggregate of 37 hours as follows:  
(i) 0.2 hours by partners Moore at $810 per hour, Park at $725 per hour, and Friedman at $940 
per hour for fees incurred of $159.80; (ii) 0.4 hours by knowledge management attorney Kane at 
$605 per hour for fees incurred of $205.70; (iii) 24.7 hours by associates Jedrey at $475 per hour 
and Parthum at $425 per hour for fees incurred of $9,054.63; and (iv) 11.7 hours by an unnamed 

paralegal at $181.41 for fees incurred of $2,122.45.  (ECF No. 242 at 4–5).  AAI argues that these 
hours are excessive.  (ECF No. 246 at 5).                                 
Cleary’s three-page exhibit detailing the time spent preparing this Application is also 
thorough.  (ECF No. 242, Ex. D).  The time spent preparing the Application was between 


3 $103,759.88, less $522.50 for the blank time entry and $238.14 for the document duplication expense, 
equals $102,999.24, then divided by 2 equates to $51,499.62.              
Magistrate Judge Pitman’s March 26, 2014 Order and April 15, 2014, when Cleary submitted its 
Application.  (Id.; ECF No. 235).  Over half of the time (21.6 hours, or 58.38%) was recorded by 
associate Parthum at an hourly rate of $425.  (Id.).  Only one partner, Friedman, recorded any 

time, a total of 0.2 hours.  (ECF No. 242, Ex. D at 1).  The rest of the time was recorded by:  
(i) associate Jedrey at an hourly rate of $475; (ii) knowledge management attorney, Kane, at an 
hourly rate of $605 for 0.4 hours; and (iii) two paralegals at an aggregate hourly rate of $181.41.  
(Id.).  Given that the timekeepers preparing the Application compiled and distilled information 
from twenty timekeepers, created four aggregate timesheets, and drafted arguments supporting 
the Application, the Court finds that 37 hours spent over an 18-day period4 is a reasonable 

amount.  The Court also finds that Cleary’s use of seven timekeepers to prepare this Application 
is reasonable.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5.                   
Accordingly, for preparing the Application, Defendants are awarded $5,771.29, which is 
half of the total of $11,542.58 incurred in preparing the Application.    
                       CONCLUSION                                    

For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Application is GRANTED in part and DENIED in 
part.  Defendants are awarded $57,270.91 in attorney’s fees pursuant to Rules 16(f)(2) and 
37(c)(1).  In accordance with the Magistrate Judge Pitman’s Opinion and Order dated March 26, 
2014, AAI and its counsel must pay Defendants by Monday, January 6, 2020.  The Clerk of Court 
is respectfully directed to close ECF No. 242.

SARAH L. CAVE, United States Magistrate Judge.                            

Before the Court is the application of Defendants Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Yield 
Book, Inc. (“Defendants”) for an Award of Expenses Pursuant to the Court’s Partial Grant of 
Motion to Strike the Fourth Declaration of Jianqing Fan (the “Application”).  (ECF No. 242).  For 
the reasons set forth below, Defendants’ Application is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. 
                      BACKGROUND                                     
Given this action’s lengthy history, the Court assumes the reader’s familiarity with the 
background  of  this  case  and  references  only  facts  necessary  to  explain  this  opinion.    A 
comprehensive recitation of the events giving rise to this action is set forth in the Honorable 
Henry B. Pitman’s Opinion and Order dated March 26, 2014 granting Defendants’ motion for 
expenses.  (ECF No. 235).                                                 
This action has been pending for over fifteen years and stems from the allegations of 
Advanced Analytics, Inc. (“AAI”) that Defendants misappropriated AAI’s sequences of numbers 
used to aid in pricing mortgage-backed securities and incorporated them into Defendants’ 
software, the Yield Book, or used them to create new sequences for use in the Yield Book.  (ECF 
No. 235 at 3).  In January 2012, Magistrate Judge Pitman set a revised discovery schedule ordering 
the submission of AAI’s expert disclosures by May 17, 2012 and completion of all discovery by 
July 17, 2012; he also admonished the parties to raise discovery disputes promptly.  (Id.).  Despite 

these instructions, on July 18, 2012, AAI attempted to submit a “reply expert report from Dr. 
Jinqing Fan,” past the May 17, 2012 deadline (the “Fan Reply”).  (Id. at 3–4).  (See July 18, 2012 
Disc. Conf. Tr., ECF No. 226 at 121, 146–49).  Defendants moved to strike the Fan Reply as 
untimely and not constituting “a proper ‘reply,’ because it contained new information and 
opinions that were not within the scope of either parties’ prior expert disclosures.”  (Id. at 4).  

Magistrate Judge Pitman issued an Order granting Defendants’ motion (ECF No. 174), AAI 
objected, and on February 8, 2013, the Honorable Laura T. Swain, United States District Judge, 
overruled AAI’s objections.  (ECF No. 214).                               
The parties then briefed Defendants’ “motion for summary judgment and their Rule 
702/Daubert motion to exclude Dr. Fan’s initial report and testimony based on that report.”  (ECF 
No. 235 at 5).  AAI’s “opposition to both motions included the Fourth Fan” Declaration, which 

incorporated by reference and relied on the entire previously stricken Fan Reply (the “Fourth Fan 
Declaration”).  (Id.at 6).  On June 10, 2013, Defendants requested a conference for their 
“anticipated motion to strike the Fourth Fan [Declaration] on the grounds that it was untimely 
and contained entirely new bases for AAI’s claims.”  (Id.).  On June 17, 2013, AAI requested a 
conference for its “anticipated motion for sanctions against defendants . . . based on allegations 
of discovery misconduct set forth in the Fourth Fan [Declaration].”  (Id.).  AAI sought to use the 

Fourth Fan Declaration in support of its motion for sanctions.  (Id. at 15).  On June 19, 2013, 
Magistrate Judge Pitman “directed the parties to complete their briefing on Defendants’ motion 
to strike the Fourth Fan [Declaration] and . . . deferred consideration of AAI’s contemplated 
motion for sanctions until the dispute concerning the Fourth Fan [Declaration] was resolved.”  
(Id. at 7).                                                               

On  July  10,  2013,  “pursuant  to  Rules 16, 26, and 37  of the  Federal Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure,” Defendants moved to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration, to “exclude Dr. Fan’s 2007 
Report and testimony concerning the opinions set forth in that report,” and for an award of “their 
expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred in connection with” the motion.  (ECF No. 
235 at 1–2).                                                              

On March 26, 2014, Magistrate Judge Pitman held that AAI was precluded from using the 
Fourth Fan Declaration to oppose Defendants’ motion summary judgment “or in connection with 
any other dispute involving the merits of the claims and defenses” because it was “untimely 
under [his] scheduling Order and was served in violation of Rule 26(a)(2),” and went “beyond Dr. 
Fan’s timely produced expert disclosures.”  (ECF No. 235 at 16, 23, 30–31).  Magistrate Judge 
Pitman also held that AAI could use “section G, ¶¶ 257–73” of the Fourth Fan Declaration to 

respond to “Defendants’ rule 702/Daubert motion,” but “[g]iven the age of this matter, the fact 
that the Fourth Fan [Declaration] does not rely on information first produced after the close of 
discovery, [his] admonition in January 2012 that discovery disputes be raised promptly and the 
almost year-long gap between the close of discovery and the earliest date on which a sanctions 
motion could possibly have been made,” AAI could not use the Fourth Fan Declaration in support 
of its motion for sanctions.  (Id. at 32, 34, 36).  Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Pitman found that 

Defendants are “entitled to recover some of their attorney’s fees and costs” but only half of “the 
fees and costs incurred in making” their motion “as a result of AAI’s failure to comply with the 
Scheduling Order and Rule 26(a)(2).”  (Id. at 36–37).                     
Magistrate Judge Pitman ordered Defendants to submit their Application within 20 days 

of his order with AAI’s response due 20 days thereafter.  (ECF No. 235 at 38).  Defendants timely 
submitted their Application under seal requesting an award of $91,246.55 (ECF No. 242 ¶6), and 
AAI timely submitted their response under seal.  (ECF No. 246).           
                     LEGAL STANDARD                                  
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(f)(2), “in addition to or instead of sanctions, the 

court may award ‘reasonable expenses — including attorney’s fees — incurred because of 
noncompliance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other 
circumstances made an award of expenses unjust.’”  Tessemae’s LLC v. Atlantis Capital LLC, No. 
18 Civ. 4902 (KHP), 2019 WL 2635956, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 2019) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 16(f)(2)).  Under the law of this Circuit, identical language in Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure imposes on the disobedient party the “burden to show that his failure is justified 

or that special circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.”  Id. at *3 (internal citation 
omitted).  The prevailing party is also entitled to costs, including “reasonable out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by attorneys and ordinarily charged to their clients.”  Kreisler v. Second 
Avenue Diner Corp., No. 10 Civ. 7592 RJS), 2013 WL 3965247, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2013) 
(internal citation omitted).                                              
The district court has broad discretion to determine the amount to be awarded.  Vincent 

v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 651 F.3d 299, 307 (2d Cir. 2011).  In Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens 
Neighborhood Ass’n. v. Cnty. of Albany, 522 F.3d 182 (2d Cir. 2008), the Second Circuit articulated 
the method for calculating reasonable attorney’s fees:  a reasonable hourly rate multiplied by a 
reasonable number of hours extended on the work constitutes the “presumptively reasonable 
fee,” also known as the “lodestar.”  Kreisler, 2013 WL 3965247, at *1.  A court using the lodestar 

method sets the lodestar, then considers “whether, in light of variables such as the difficulty of 
the case, it should adjust the lodestar before settling on the reasonable fee.”  Arbor Hill, 522 F.3d 
at 187.                                                                   
To aid in the court’s analysis, a fee application should be supported by “contemporaneous 
time records” relaying the rates charged and hours worked by each attorney.  N.Y. State Ass’n 

for Retarded Children, Inc. v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1154 (2d Cir. 1983).  The attorneys “should 
maintain billing time records in a manner that will enable a reviewing court to identify distinct 
claims.”  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983); see Themis Capital v. Democratic 
Republic of Congo, No. 09 Civ. 1652 (PAE), 2014 WL 4379100, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2014) 
(reducing hours by twenty percent for “impermissibly broad” block billing).  A court should look 
at the “nature of the legal matter and context of the fee award in considering the reasonable rate 

and reasonable time spent on the matter.”  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *3.    
To determine the hourly rate, a court considers “what a reasonable, paying client would 
be willing to pay, given that such a party wishes to spend the minimum necessary to litigate the 
case effectively.”  Bergerson v. N.Y. State Office of Mental Health, Cent. N.Y. Psychiatric Ctr., 652 
F.3d 277, 289–90 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal citation omitted).  In addition, the Second Circuit has a 
“forum rule” requiring the use of “hourly rates employed in the district in which the reviewing 

court sits in calculating the presumptively reasonable fee.”  Id. at 289 (internal citation omitted).  
The court’s determination of the reasonable hourly rate is aided by the rate “prevailing in the 
community  for  similar services  by  lawyers  of reasonably  comparable  skill,  experience and 
reputation.”  Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n.11 (1984).  “Courts in this District have 
determined that hourly rates ranging from $250 to $1,260 per hour, for attorneys’ work on a 

commercial litigation matter were reasonable” depending on complexity, experience, and skill 
required.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *4 (collecting cases).  The court may adjust base 
hourly rates to account for case specific variables such as the complexity of the issues and 
attorneys’ experiences.  See MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co. Holding S.A. v. Forsyth Kowancki 
LLC, No. 16 Civ. 8103 (LGS), 2017 WL 1194372, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2017) (adjusting fees based 

on case specific matters).                                                
To determine the reasonable number of hours worked, the court should strike a balance 
“between principles of thoroughness and efficiency.”  LCS Grp. LLC v. Shire LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d 
274, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  The court must examine the amount of time spent on each task and 
decide “how much of that time was reasonably expended given the scope and complexity of the 
litigation.”  Pichardo v. C.R. Bard, Inc., No. 09 Civ. 7653 (SHS), 2015 WL 13784565, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 

Jan. 26, 2015) (internal citation omitted).  The court should also consider the number of attorneys 
involved.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5.  The court can rely on “its own familiarity 
with the case, as well as its experience with the parties’ evidentiary submissions and arguments.”  
Kreisler, 2013 WL 3965247, at *3.  Time spent preparing a fee application may be awarded.  See 
Dorchester Fin. Holdings Corp. v. Banco BRJ, S.A., No. 11 Civ. 1529 (KMW) (KNF), 2015 WL 
1062327, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3, 2015).                                   

The court may reduce the hours spent on the litigation to exclude excessive, redundant, 
or otherwise unnecessary time.  Kirsch v. Fleet St., Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 173 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing 
Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434); see LCS Grp. LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d at 281 (“A court may apply an across-
the-board reduction to effectuate the reasonable imposition of fees.”); see MSC Mediterranean 
Shipping Co. Holding S.A., 2017 WL 1194372, at *3 (reducing fees for an unopposed motion for 

default judgment in a breach of contract case; excluding a senior partner’s time because “the 
matter did not warrant the involvement of two senior partners”; and cutting paralegal’s time in 
half); see also Pichardo, 2015 WL 13784565, at *7 (reducing attorneys’ hours by forty percent 
because the recorded time addressed only one relevant issue).             
Ultimately, “[t]he essential goal in shifting fess (to either party) is to do rough justice, not 

to achieve auditing perfection.”  Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 838 (2011).  
                       DISCUSSION                                    
    I.  Determining the Aggregate Amount                             

In the Application, Defendants request an “aggregate amount of $182,493.09 of fees . . . 
incurred by Defendants ‘as a result of AAI’s failure to comply with the Scheduling Order and Rule 
26(a)(2).”  (ECF No. 242 ¶6) (quoting Magistrate Judge Pitman’s Mar. 26, 2014 Order at ECF No. 
235.)  They argue they are “entitled to reimbursement of one-half of this amount, or $91,246.55.”  
(Id.).  Defendants split their aggregate fees into four categories:  time spent (i) preparing and 
filing their motion to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration and reply in support of the motion; (ii) 
corresponding with the Court about their anticipated motion to strike the Fourth Fan Declaration 
and  associated  briefing  schedule,  and  preparing  an  opposition  to  AAI’s  motion  for 
reconsideration of the briefing schedule; (iii) redacting and performing other review and analysis 

of the Fourth Fan Declaration; and (iv) preparing the Application.  (Id. at 2–4).  Defendants attach 
corresponding diary entries as exhibits detailing each individual timekeeper’s work in that 
category.  (Id. Exs. A–D).                                                
AAI requests that the Court deduct $12,663.59 incurred in “Redacting and Performing 

Other Review and Analysis of the Fourth Fan [Declaration].”  (ECF No. 246 at 4).  AAI argues that 
Section G of the Fourth Fan Declaration, the section that Magistrate Judge Pitman permitted AAI 
use in its opposition to Defendants’ “Rule 702/Daubert motion,” referenced and can only be 
understood in conjunction with other sections of the Fourth Fan Declaration.  (ECF No. 246).  
Therefore, Defendants had to “address virtually the entirety” of the Fourth Fan Declaration in 

connection  with  that  motion,  negating  the  fees  and  costs  associated  with  “analyzing  or 
redacting” the same document.  (Id. at 3).  AAI also argues that Defendants needed to “analyze 
and redact” the Fourth Fan Declaration “notwithstanding, the Order’s direction that [it] may not 
be used for merits purposes on Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.”  (Id. at 4).  AAI’s 
argument is unpersuasive because Defendants were awarded attorney’s fees as a sanction 
against AAI for its failure to comply, not as compensation to their attorneys for services rendered.  

Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5.                                   
The Court does, however, reduce the aggregate amount of Defendants’ fees based on its 
familiarity with this litigation, review of the record, and to effectuate the reasonable imposition 
of fees.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5; LCS Grp. LLC, 383 F. Supp. 3d at 281.  
Magistrate Judge Pitman found that Defendants are entitled to recover half of “the fees and costs 
incurred in making” their motion.  (ECF No. 235 at 36).  Later in the same order, he wrote that 

Defendants shall be reimbursed for one-half of expenses incurred “as a result of AAI’s failure to 
comply with the Scheduling Order and Rule 26(a)(2).”  (Id. at 37).  Defendants argue these phrases 
mean that AAI should reimburse them for fees and expenses beyond what was expended for the 
motion.  The Court does not interpret Magistrate Judge Pitman’s statement the same way, 
particularly because in the following sentence, he directed “Defendants’ counsel to submit a 

sworn statement, with supporting documentation, regarding the costs and fees associated with 
the present motion and justifying the hourly rates.”  (Id.) (emphasis added).  Therefore, only the 
costs and fees associated with the motion for expenses, not all expenses and fees associated with 
AAI’s failure, should be included in the aggregate number to be used as a starting point.   
Defendants seem to recognize this limit because, in a footnote, they state that if “the 

Court  intended  to  limit  Defendants’  recovery to  one-half  of  all  expenses  incurred  only  in 
connection with making the motion to strike . . . then the Defendants would be entitled to 
recover” $51,879.94, “which excludes work done in reviewing the Fourth Fan Declaration, 
apprising the Court of the intended Motion to Strike and negotiating a briefing schedule, and 
preparing the instant fee application.”  (ECF No. 242 at 6 n.4).          
Accordingly, the Court finds that as a starting point, Defendants are entitled to, at most, 

one-half of the $103,759.88 attorney’s fees and costs incurred in preparing and filing their motion 
to strike and reply in support of the motion.  Vincent, 651 F.3d at 307.  In addition, as a corollary 
to their motion to strike and reply in support, the Court also finds that as a starting point, 
Defendants are entitled to, at most, one-half of the $11,542.58 attorney’s fees and costs incurred 
in preparing the Application.  Dorchester Fin. Holdings Corp., 2015 WL 1062327, at *3. 
    II.  Hourly Rates                                                

Defendants’ counsel, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP (“Cleary”), states that the fees 
from June 2013 through August 2013 were invoiced to Defendants and paid in full.  (ECF No. 242 
at 4).  Cleary argues that its hourly rates are “customary for the legal market in which [it] serves 
its clients, including Defendants.”  (Id.).  Cleary also provides that it discounted the bill by fifteen 
percent.  (Id.).  Cleary submitted contemporaneous time records, describing each timekeeper’s 

task, the date of the specified task, and the time expended on each task.  (Id., Exs. A, D).   
Specific to preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion, Cleary lists 
ten timekeepers:  (i) two partners, Christopher Moore at $810 per hour and Jennifer Kennedy 
Park at $725 per hour; (ii) one managing attorney, Richard Conza at $605 per hour; (iii) five 
associates, Nathaniel Jedrey at $475 per hour; and Nicholas Fung, Jennifer McArdle, Catherine 

Gordley, and Michelle Parthum, each at $425 per hour; (iv) one unnamed paralegal at an 
apparent hourly rate of $205.42 (based on fees incurred of $5,484.68 for 26.7 hours); and (v) one 
unnamed non-legal personnel1 at an apparent hourly rate of $141.35 (based on fees incurred of 
$381.65 for 2.7 hours ).  (ECF No. 242 at 2, 5).                          
Specific to preparing the Application, Cleary lists seven timekeepers:  (i) three partners: 
Moore, Park, and Lawrence B. Friedman at $940 per hour; (ii) one knowledge management 

attorney, Sheila Kane at $605 per hour; (iii) two associates, Jedrey and Parthum; and (iv) one 
unnamed paralegal at an apparent hourly rate of $181.41 (based on fees incurred of $2,122.45 
for 11.7 hours).  (ECF No. 242 at 4–5).                                   
For all of the work listed in the Application, Cleary lists six paralegals billed at hourly rates 
of $280, $275, $265, $230, and two at $210 each, and four non-legal personnel billed at hourly 
rates of $260, $150, and two at $140 each.  (ECF No. 242 at 5).  The unnamed paralegal used in 


1 Cleary notes that non-legal personnel “include litigation technology specialists and assistant managing 
clerks.”  (ECF No. 242 at 2 n.2).                                         
preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion appears to be an aggregate of 
Michelle Barras at $265 per hour, Benazir Rozan at $275 per hour, Shanaz Muztaza at $210 per 
hour, and Roxenna Reyes-Seri at $280 per hour.  (Compare ECF Nos. 242 at 5 with 242, Ex. A).  

The non-legal personnel used in preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion 
appears to be an aggregate of Michael Ahn at $140 per hour, Aleksandr Abelev at $260 per hour, 
and Alison Wrynn at $150 per hour.  (Id.).  The unnamed paralegal used in preparing the 
Application appears to be an aggregate of Katie Shragge at $210 per hour and Samuel Racker at 
$230 per hour.  (Compare ECF Nos. 242 at 5 with 242, Ex. D).  Because the specified fees provided 

for the paralegals and non-legal personnel are an aggregate, the Court will use its calculated 
hourly rates of $205.42, $141.35, and $181.41, respectively.  See MSC Mediterranean Shipping 
Co. Holding S.A., 2017 WL 1194372, at *3 (finding that, in its discretion, the court can adjust 
hourly rates).                                                            
Pursuant to the Second Circuit’s forum rule, the hourly rates set for the attorneys and 
staff appear reasonable at a range of $725 to $940 for partners; $425 to $605 for non-partner 

attorneys; and $141.35 to $205.42 for paralegals and non-legal personnel.  See Tessemae’s LLC, 
2019 WL 2635956, at *4 (collecting cases).  Cleary did not provide information regarding the 
attorneys’ experiences, but the Court has discretion to rely on its own familiarity with the case 
and the parties’ expertise.  See Kreisler, 2013 WL 3965247, at *3.  Cleary is a well-regarded firm 
known  for  its  expertise  in  commercial  litigation.    Cleary  Gottlieb, 
https://www.clearygottlieb.com/practice-landing/litigation-and-arbitration (last visited Dec. 3, 

2019).  This case has a fifteen-year history, involving considerable motion practice, and involves 
complex issues regarding software and trade secrets.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Cleary’s 
hourly rates are reasonable.                                              
   III.  Number of Hours                                             

          A.   Motion to strike and reply                            
Specific to preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion, Cleary 
allocates an aggregate of 241.5 hours as follows:  (i) 63.1 hours by partners Moore at $810 per 
hour and Park at $725 per hour for fees incurred of $41,931.66; (ii) 1.4 hours by managing 
attorney Conza at $605 per hour for fees incurred of $719.95; (iii) 147.6 hours by associates 
Jedrey at $475 per hour, and Fung, McArdle, Gordley, and Parthum each at $425 per hour each 
for fees incurred of $55,003.80; (iv) 26.7 hours by an unnamed paralegal at $205.42 per hour for 

fees incurred of $5,484.68; (v) 2.7 hours by an unnamed non-legal personnel at $141.35 per hour 
for fees incurred of $381.65; and (vi) expenses of $238.14.2  (ECF No. 242 at 2, 5).  AAI argues 
that Defendants’ 241.5 hours spent preparing their motion to strike and reply in support of the 
motion are excessive.  (ECF No. 246 at 5).  AAI argues that the “charges listed are excessive,” 
particularly charging $41,931.66 in partner time for preparing and filing the motion to strike and 
reply brief, constituting “43.2 percent of the combined partner-associate charge of $96,935.46.”  

(Id. at 4).                                                               
Cleary’s eleven-page exhibit detailing each timekeeper’s tasks for the motion to strike and 
reply in support of the motion is thorough.  (ECF No. 242, Ex. A).  All the time recorded preparing 
the motion to strike and reply in support of the motion was between June 19, 2013, when 


2 Defendants note that the “referenced expenses were incurred in the duplication of documents.”  (ECF 
No. 242 at 3 n.3).                                                        
Magistrate Judge Pitman ordered the parties to finish briefing the motion, and August 9, 2013, 
when Defendants filed their certificates of service for their motion and reply.  (ECF Nos. 242, Ex. 
A; 234; 235 at 7).  The Court disagrees with AAI’s contention that the 241.5 hours spent over a 

seven-week period (less than 35 hours per week) preparing the motion to strike and reply in 
support of the motion are excessive.  Again, this is a complex case with over fifteen years of 
history.  Considerable time was reasonably necessary to craft Defendants’ motion to strike and 
reply to AAI’s formidable opposition.  See Pichardo, 2015 WL 13784565, at *4.  In addition, 
although  Defendants  did  incur  $41,931.66  in  partner  fees,  that  amount  only  constitutes 

63.1 hours, or 26.13%, of the total time spent preparing the motion and reply.  The Court has 
already found the partners’ rates reasonable, so the fees incurred at those rates are reasonable 
because the work was relevant and not excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.  Kirsch, 
148 F.3d at 173.  The Court also finds that it was reasonable for ten timekeepers to be involved 
in preparing Defendants’ filings, given the complexities of this litigation.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 
WL 2635956, at *5.                                                        

Defendants state that “certain items in the diary entries have been redacted on the basis 
of attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine” and offer to make unredacted 
entries available for in camera review.  (ECF No. 242 at 2 n.1).  The Court does not find that 
necessary because despite the redactions, the amount of time spent on each task is reasonable 
given the complexity and length of the litigation, with one exception.  See Pichardo, 2015 WL 
13784565, at *4.  First, Defendants charge 1.1 hours to associate Jedrey on August 6, 2013 but 

redact the entire description.  (ECF No. 242 Ex. A at 9).  The Court cannot award undescribed fees.  
The Court does not deem further in camera review of one entry totaling a $522.50 (Jedrey’s $475 
rate X 1.1 hours) deduction necessary in this already-protracted litigation.  Therefore, the Court 
deducts $522.50 from Cleary’s fees for preparing the motion to strike and reply in support of the 
motion.  In addition, while the Court has discretion to award associated expenses, the Court 

declines to award $238.14 in expenses for duplicating documents.  (See ECF No. 242 at 2).  Cleary 
does not specify the reason for the duplication so the Court cannot find it reasonable. 
Accordingly, for preparing and filing the motion to strike and reply in support of the 
motion, Defendants are awarded $51,499.62.3 .                             
     B.   Preparing the Application                                  
Specific to preparing the Application, Cleary allocates an aggregate of 37 hours as follows:  
(i) 0.2 hours by partners Moore at $810 per hour, Park at $725 per hour, and Friedman at $940 

per hour for fees incurred of $159.80; (ii) 0.4 hours by knowledge management attorney Kane at 
$605 per hour for fees incurred of $205.70; (iii) 24.7 hours by associates Jedrey at $475 per hour 
and Parthum at $425 per hour for fees incurred of $9,054.63; and (iv) 11.7 hours by an unnamed 
paralegal at $181.41 for fees incurred of $2,122.45.  (ECF No. 242 at 4–5).  AAI argues that these 
hours are excessive.  (ECF No. 246 at 5).                                 
Cleary’s three-page exhibit detailing the time spent preparing this Application is also 

thorough.  (ECF No. 242, Ex. D).  The time spent preparing the Application was between 
Magistrate Judge Pitman’s March 26, 2014 Order and April 15, 2014, when Cleary submitted its 
Application.  (Id.; ECF No. 235).  Over half of the time (21.6 hours, or 58.38%) was recorded by 
associate Parthum at an hourly rate of $425.  (Id.).  Only one partner, Friedman, recorded any 


3 $103,759.88, less $522.50 for the blank time entry and $238.14 for the document duplication expense, 
equals $102,999.24, then divided by 2 equates to $51,499.62.              
time, a total of 0.2 hours.  (ECF No. 242, Ex.  D at 1).  The rest of the time was recorded  by: 
(i) associate Jedrey at an hourly rate of $475; (ii) knowledge management attorney, Kane, at an 
hourly rate of $605 for 0.4 hours; and (iii) two paralegals at an aggregate hourly rate of $181.41. 
(Id.).  Given that the timekeepers preparing the Application compiled and distilled information 
from twenty timekeepers, created four aggregate timesheets, and drafted arguments supporting 
the Application, the Court finds that 37  hours spent over an  18-day period’ is a  reasonable 
amount.  The Court also finds that Cleary’s use of seven timekeepers to prepare this Application 
is reasonable.  Tessemae’s LLC, 2019 WL 2635956, at *5. 
 Accordingly, for preparing the Application, Defendants are awarded $5,771.29, which is 
half of the total of $11,542.58 incurred in preparing the Application. 
                            CONCLUSION 
 For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ Application is GRANTED in part and DENIED in 
part.  Defendants are awarded $57,270.91 in attorney’s fees pursuant to Rule 16(f)(2), which AAI 
must pay by Monday, January 6, 2020.  The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to close 
ECF No. 242.
