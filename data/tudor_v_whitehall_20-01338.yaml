reason_for_appeal: '=== Angel Tudor''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in holding that her admitted ability to perform the essential functions of her teaching job without the requested accommodation was, as a matter of law, fatal to her ADA failure-to-accommodate claim.

  2. Appellant contended that under the ADA’s text and framework, an employee who can perform the essential functions of the job "with or without" reasonable accommodation may still be a qualified individual entitled to a reasonable accommodation, including a modified work schedule such as guaranteed 15‑minute afternoon breaks.

  3. Appellant further argued that the district court misapplied the third element of the prima facie failure‑to‑accommodate test by effectively requiring her to prove she was unable to perform the essential functions of her job without the accommodation, rather than focusing on whether she was otherwise qualified and whether the employer refused a reasonable accommodation.'
