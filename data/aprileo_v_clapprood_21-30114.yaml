outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Cheryl Clapprood, City of Springfield, Officer Richard T. Ward, Officer Thalia Castro, Officer Jason Bacis''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in holding that the Heck v. Humphrey doctrine does not bar Aprileo''s § 1983 claims because her criminal case was dismissed without a conviction.

  2. Appellants contended that Aprileo''s agreement to pretrial probation under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 276, § 87 should be treated as a conviction for purposes of the Heck bar.

  3. Appellants maintained that the dismissal of the charges against Aprileo following the pretrial probation period was not a favorable termination of the criminal proceedings against her and that allowing her § 1983 claim would contradict the holding of Heck.

  4. Appellants argued that allowing Aprileo to pursue an excessive force claim under § 1983 based on the same incident underlying her criminal charges would undermine the finality and formality of her probation agreement and violate the legal principles and policy objectives underlying Heck.'
