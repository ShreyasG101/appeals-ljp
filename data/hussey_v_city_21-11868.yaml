outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Brian Hussey''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Hussey argued that the district court erred in holding that the Department''s interest in preventing unnecessary disruptions outweighed his First Amendment interests.

  2. Hussey contended that the value of his speech was high because his comment touched on important public issues concerning pending legislation.

  3. Hussey asserted that the Department''s mere prediction of disruption, absent evidence of ''actual disruption,'' should not outweigh the relevant free speech interests, and urged the appellate court to require a showing of actual disruption where the primary purpose of speech is to discuss a matter of public concern.

  4. Hussey argued that even if actual disruption is not required, the Department''s prediction of disruption was unreasonable and unsupported by specific facts or circumstances.

  5. Hussey claimed that the Department''s interest should be accorded little value because the Department was motivated not by any reasonable concern for disruption but by impermissible viewpoint discrimination, or at least that there was a genuine dispute of fact as to its motivation.

  6. Hussey contended that the Department did not regulate other speech that could have implicated harmony and community trust, demonstrating that he was singled out based on disagreement with the content of his speech.

  7. Hussey argued that the Department made no inquiry into who was aware of the speech in question, and there was no evidence that the post reached members of the community with substance abuse issues.

  8. Hussey asserted that nothing about the time, place, and manner of his speech had the potential to be disruptive because he posted on his personal Facebook account, from his personal phone, while at home.

  9. Hussey claimed that there was no evidence in the record that his post caused actual disruption in the community or within the Department.'
