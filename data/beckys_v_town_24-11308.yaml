reason_for_appeal: '=== Becky''s Broncos, LLC; James Broad; Rebecca McCrensky''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the Nantucket ordinance violates the dormant Commerce Clause by discriminating in effect against out-of-state competitors and insulating incumbent companies from competition.

  2. Appellants contended that the ordinance unreasonably restrains trade in violation of federal and state antitrust laws, specifically the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Massachusetts Antitrust Act.

  3. Appellants argued that Nantucket impermissibly infringed their procedural due process rights by denying them a property interest in a license, asserting that the ordinance requires the Select Board to issue a license to all paying applicants.

  4. Appellants pressed a substantive due process challenge, claiming that the ordinance is not rationally related to legitimate government interests and is therefore unconstitutional.'
