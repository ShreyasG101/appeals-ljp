outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Plaintiffs-Appellants (Jonathan L. Ashley, III, et al.)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their complaint by failing to recognize that Defendants knowingly and culpably provided substantial assistance to terrorist organizations, in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) as amended by JASTA.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) aided and abetted terrorist attacks by providing banking services to two Pakistani fertilizer companies whose product was smuggled into Afghanistan and used to manufacture IEDs that injured Plaintiffs.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the Banks (SCB, Deutsche Bank, and Danske Bank) facilitated large-scale money laundering schemes while knowing that money laundering is closely connected to terrorist financing, and that the proceeds of these operations ultimately reached terrorist organizations responsible for the attacks.

  4. Plaintiffs claimed that the Banks aided and abetted the financing of a terrorist network known as the ''Syndicate'' by facilitating transactions in tax fraud (VAT fraud) schemes, knowing that such schemes were commonly used by terrorists.

  5. Plaintiffs asserted that Defendants’ banking services aided and abetted a terrorist ''campaign'' or pattern of violent racketeering activities designed to remove Americans from Afghanistan, and that liability should extend to Defendants for aiding a group of terrorists in their racketeering activities, not just for aiding a particular attack.

  6. Plaintiffs objected to the district court’s dismissal with prejudice, arguing that further amendment of their complaint should have been permitted.'
