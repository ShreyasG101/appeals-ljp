VALERIE FIGUEREDO, United States Magistrate  Judge 
     Plaintiff Giovanni R. Nunez seeks judicial review of a final determination by Defendant, 
the Acting Commissioner (“Commissioner”) of the Social Security Administration (“SSA”)!, 
denying Nunez’s application for Supplemental Security Income benefits under Title XVI of the 
Social Security Act (the “Act”). Before the Court is Nunez’s motion for judgment on the pleadings 
and the Commissioner’s cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons set forth below, Nunez’s motion is DENIED, 
and the Commissioner’s cross-motion is GRANTED. 

      On July 9, 2021, Kilolo Kijakazi became Acting Commissioner of the SSA, and is 
therefore substituted as the named defendant. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d) (permitting automatic 
substitution of a party who is a public official sued in her official capacity when the public 
official “ceases to hold office” while a suit is pending).

                          BACKGROUND                                      
  A.  Procedural History                                                  
    On September 13, 2018, Nunez completed his application for Supplemental Security 
Income benefits (“SSI”) and Disability Insurance benefits (“DIB”), alleging August 22, 2018 as the 
onset date of his disability. SSA Administrative Record (“R.”) at 169-80, ECF No. 16. When 
Nunez applied for SSI and DIB, he alleged disability based on agoraphobia, panic disorder, vertigo, 

anxiety disorder, and learning disability. Id. at 204. Nunez’s claims for SSI and DIB were initially 
denied on December 24, 2018, id. at 103-10, and on December 27, 2018, Nunez filed a written 
request for a hearing before an administrative law judge, id. at 111-12.   
    On August 14, 2019, Nunez and his counsel, Renee Moore, appeared before Administrative 
Law Judge Angela Banks (hereinafter, the “ALJ”) at a hearing in the Bronx, New York. Id. at 40-
70. On November 14, 2019, the ALJ issued her written decision, finding that Nunez has not been 
under a disability within the meaning of the Act from August 22, 2018, through the date of her 
decision. Id. at 19-33. Nunez requested a review of the ALJ’s decision by the SSA Appeals Council 
on December 20, 2019, which was denied on January 14, 2021. Id. at 166-68, 1-7. That denial 
made the November 14, 2019 decision of the ALJ the final action of the Commissioner. See 

Lesterhuis v. Colvin, 805 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (“If the Appeals Council denies 
review of a case, the ALJ’s decision, and not the Appeals Council’s, is the final agency decision.”) 
(citation omitted).                                                        
         On March 16, 2021, after exhausting his administrative remedies, Nunez 
commenced the instant action seeking judicial review of the ALJ’s decision, and requesting that 
this Court modify the decision and grant Nunez SSI payments as allowed under the Act.2 See 


    2 Although Nunez applied for both SSI and DIB, Nunez challenges only the 
Commissioner’s denial of SSI benefits. See Complaint, ¶ c, ECF No. 1.      
Complaint, ECF No. 1. On September 27, 2021, the Commissioner filed the Administrative 
Record, which constituted her answer. ECF No. 16. Thereafter, on January 25, 2022, Nunez moved 
for judgment on the pleadings and submitted a memorandum of law in support of his motion, 
requesting that the Court reverse the ALJ’s decision or remand for further proceedings. ECF Nos. 
19-20. On May 27, 2022, the Commissioner submitted her opposition and a cross-motion for 
judgment on the pleadings. ECF Nos. 26-27. Nunez filed a reply to the Commissioner’s opposition 

and cross-motion on June 7, 2022. ECF No. 28.                              
  B.  Medical Evidence                                                    
    The parties’ memoranda in support of their motions for judgment on the pleadings 
provide summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record. See Pl.’s 
Br. at 1-10, ECF No. 20; Def.’s Br. at 4-12, EFC No. 27. Having examined the record, the 
Court concludes that the parties have accurately stated its contents. Although the parties focus 
on different aspects of the record at times, there are no inconsistencies in the parties’ 
recounting of the medical evidence. Moreover, no party has objected to the other’s summary of 
the medical evidence. The Court therefore adopts the parties’ summaries as complete for the 
purposes of the issues raised in this action. See Collado v. Kijakazi, No. 20-CV-11112 (JLC), 

2022 WL 1960612, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 6, 2022) (adopting parties’ summaries of medical 
evidence where parties did not dispute recitation of relevant facts); Scully v. Berryhill, 282 F. 
Supp. 3d 628, 631 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (adopting parties’ summaries where they were 
“substantially consistent with each other” and neither party objected to the opposing party’s 
summary). The medical evidence in the record is discussed below to the extent necessary to 
address the issues raised in the pending cross-motions.                    
                           DISCUSSION                                     
  A.  Legal Standards                                                     
       1.  Judgment on the Pleadings                                      
    A Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is evaluated under the same standard as 
a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Bank of N.Y. v. First Millennium, Inc., 607 F.3d 905, 922 (2d 
Cir. 2010). Thus, “[t]o survive a Rule 12(c) motion, the complaint must contain sufficient factual 

matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted).                                     
       2.  Judicial Review of the Commissioner’s Decision                 
    An individual may obtain judicial review of a final decision of the Commissioner “in the 
district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides.” 42 U.S.C. 
§ 405(g). A court reviewing a final decision by the Commissioner “is limited to determining 
whether the [Commissioner’s] conclusions were supported by substantial evidence in the record 
and were based on a correct legal standard.” Selian v. Astrue, 708 F.3d 409, 417 (2d Cir. 2013) 
(per curiam) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Greek v. Colvin, 802 F.3d 
370, 374-75 (2d Cir. 2015) (per curiam); see generally 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) (“The findings of the 

Commissioner of Social Security as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be 
conclusive”).                                                              
    Substantial evidence is “more than a mere scintilla.” Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 
407 (1971) (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. N.L.R.B., 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)); accord Greek, 802 
F.3d at 374-75; Burgess v. Astrue, 537 F.3d 117, 127-28 (2d Cir. 2008). “It means—and means 
only—such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a 
conclusion.” Biestek v. Berryhill, 139 S. Ct. 1148, 1154 (2019) (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted). “Under the substantial-evidence standard, a court looks to an existing 
administrative record and asks whether it contains ‘sufficien[t] evidence’ to support the agency’s 
factual determinations . . . whatever the meaning of ‘substantial’ in other contexts, the threshold for 
such evidentiary sufficiency is not high.” Id. (citation omitted). In weighing whether substantial 
evidence exists to support the Commissioner’s decision, “the reviewing court is required to 
examine the entire record, including contradictory evidence and evidence from which conflicting 
inferences can be drawn.” Selian, 708 F.3d at 417 (quoting Mongeur v. Heckler, 722 F.2d 1033, 

1038 (2d Cir. 1983) (per curium)).                                         
    The substantial evidence standard is a “very deferential standard of review.” Brault v. Soc. 
Sec. Admin., Comm’r, 683 F.3d 443, 448 (2d Cir. 2012). The Court “must be careful not to 
substitute its own judgment for that of the Commissioner, even if it might justifiably have reached 
a different result upon a de novo review.” DeJesus v. Astrue, 762 F. Supp. 2d 673, 683 (S.D.N.Y. 
2011) (quoting Jones v. Sullivan, 949 F.2d 57, 59 (2d Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks and 
alterations omitted). “[O]nce an ALJ finds facts, [a court] can reject those facts ‘only if a 
reasonable factfinder would have to conclude otherwise.’” Brault, 683 F.3d at 448 (quoting Warren 
v. Shalala, 29 F.3d 1287, 1290 (8th Cir. 1994)) (emphasis omitted). “Even where the administrative 
record may also adequately support contrary findings on particular issues, the ALJ’s factual 

findings must be given conclusive effect so long as they are supported by substantial evidence.” 
Genier v. Astrue, 606 F.3d 46, 49 (2d Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted); see also Johnson v. Astrue, 563 F. Supp. 2d 444, 454 (S.D.N.Y. 2008). 
       3.  Commissioner’s Determination of Disability                     
    The Social Security Act defines the term “disability” as the “inability to engage in any 
substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment 
which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a 
continuous period of not less than 12 months.” 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A); see id. § 1382c(a)(3)(A). 
Physical or mental impairments must be “of such severity that [the claimant] is not only unable to 
do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in 
any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.” 42 U.S.C. § 
423(d)(2)(A); see id. § 1382c(a)(3)(B). In assessing a claimant’s impairments and determining 
whether they meet the statutory definition of disability, the Commissioner “must make a thorough 
inquiry into the claimant’s condition and must be mindful that ‘the Social Security Act is a 

remedial statute, to be broadly construed and liberally applied.’” Mongeur, 722 F.2d at 1037 
(quoting Gold v. Sec’y of H.E.W., 463 F.2d 38, 41 (2d Cir. 1972)). The Commissioner is required 
to examine: “(1) the objective medical facts; (2) diagnoses or medical opinions based on such facts; 
(3) subjective evidence of pain or disability testified to by the claimant or others; and (4) the 
claimant’s educational background, age, and work experience.” Id. (citations omitted); accord 
Brown v. Apfel, 174 F.3d 59, 62 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam); Craig v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., 218 F. 
Supp. 3d 249, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).                                         
                          Five-Step Inquiry                               
    “The Social Security Administration has outlined a ‘five-step, sequential evaluation 
process’ to determine whether a claimant is disabled[.]” Estrella v. Berryhill, 925 F.3d 90, 94 (2d 

Cir. 2019) (citations omitted); 20 C.F.R. § 416.920(a)(4). First, the Commissioner must determine 
whether the claimant is currently engaged in any “substantial gainful activity.” 20 C.F.R. § 
416.920(a)(4)(i). Second, if the claimant is unemployed, the Commissioner must decide if the 
claimant has a “severe medically determinable physical or mental impairment,” id. § 
416.920(a)(4)(ii), which is an impairment or combination of impairments that “significantly limits 
[the claimant’s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities,” id. § 416.920(c). Third, if 
the claimant has such an impairment, the Commissioner considers whether the medical severity of 
the impairment “meets or equals” a listing in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. See id. § 
416.920(a)(4)(iii), 416.920(d). If so, the claimant is considered disabled. Id. 
    If the claimant alleges a mental impairment, the Commissioner must apply a “special 
technique” to determine the severity of the claimant’s impairment at step two, and to determine 
whether the impairment satisfies Social Security regulations at step three. See 20 C.F.R § 
416.920a; see also Kohler v. Astrue, 546 F.3d 260, 265 (2d Cir. 2008). “If the claimant is found to 

have a ‘medically determinable mental impairment,’ the [Commissioner] must ‘specify the 
symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings that substantiate the presence of the impairment(s),’ then 
‘rate the degree of functional limitation resulting from the impairment(s) in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of [Section 416.920a],’ which specifies four broad functional areas: (1) activities of 
daily living; (2) social functioning; (3) concentration, persistence or pace; and (4) episodes of 
decompensation.” Velasquez v. Kijakazi, No. 19-CV-9303 (DF), 2021 WL 4392986, at *18 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2021) (quoting 20 C.F.R. §§ 416.920a(b), (c)(3)). “The functional limitations 
for these first three areas are rated on a five-point scale of none, mild, moderate, marked, or 
extreme, and the limitation in the fourth area (episodes of decompensation) is rated on a four-point 
scaled of none, one or two, three, or four or more.” Id. (internal quotations, alterations, and 

citations omitted).                                                        
    Fourth, if the claimant’s impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment, the 
Commissioner continues to the fourth step and determines whether the claimant has the residual 
functional capacity (“RFC”) to perform his or her past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. § 
416.920(a)(4)(iv). If the claimant is able to do such work, he or she is not disabled. Id. § 
416.920(a)(4)(iv). Finally, if the claimant is unable to perform past relevant work, the 
Commissioner must decide if the claimant’s RFC, in addition to his or her age, education, and work 
experience, permits the claimant to do other work. Id. § 416.920(a)(4)(v). If the claimant cannot 
perform other work, he or she will be deemed disabled. Id. § 416.920(a)(4)(v).  
    The claimant has the burden at the first four steps. Burgess, 537 F.3d at 128. If the claimant 
is successful, the burden shifts to the Commissioner at the fifth and final step, where the 
Commissioner must establish that the claimant has the ability to perform some work in the national 
economy. See Poupore v. Astrue, 566 F.3d 303, 306 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam).  

                   Evaluation of Medical Opinion Evidence                 
    “Regardless of its source, the ALJ must evaluate every medical opinion in determining 
whether a claimant is disabled under the [Social Security] Act.” Pena ex rel. E.R. v. Astrue, No. 
11-CV-1787 (KAM), 2013 WL 1210932, at *14 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2013) (citing 20 C.F.R. § 
416.927(d)) (internal quotation marks omitted). For SSI applications filed before March 27, 2017, 
the SSA’s regulations required application of the “treating physician rule,” which required an ALJ 
to give more weight to the opinions of physicians with the most significant relationship with the 
claimant. See 20 C.F.R. § 416.927(d)(2); see also Taylor v. Barnhart, 117 F. App’x 139, 140 (2d 
Cir. 2004). Under the treating physician rule, an ALJ was required to provide her reasoning if she 
determined that a treating physician’s opinion was not entitled to “controlling weight,” or at least 

“more weight,” than the opinions of non-treating and non-examining sources. Gonzalez v. Apfel, 
113 F. Supp. 2d 580, 588-89 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). In addition, under the treating physician rule, a 
consultative physician’s opinion was generally entitled to “little weight.” Giddings v. Astrue, 333 
F. App’x 649, 652 (2d Cir. 2009).                                          
    On January 18, 2017, the SSA published comprehensive revisions to the regulations 
regarding the evaluation of medical evidence for applications filed on or after March 27, 2017 
(such as Nunez’s application in this case). See Revisions to the Rules Regarding the Evaluation of 
Medical Evidence, 82 Fed. Reg. 5844, 5869-70, 2017 WL 168819 (Jan. 18, 2017). “In 
implementing new regulations, the SSA has apparently sought to move away from a perceived 
hierarchy of medical sources.” Velasquez, 2021 WL 4392986, at *19 (citing 82 Fed. Reg. 5844). 
The new regulations state that an ALJ need “not defer or give any specific evidentiary weight, 
including controlling weight, to any medical opinion(s) or prior administrative medical finding(s), 
including those from [a claimant’s] medical sources.”3 20 C.F.R. §416.920c(a); see also Young v. 
Kijakazi, No. 20-CV-03606 (SDA), 2021 WL 4148733, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2021). Instead, 

an ALJ must consider all medical opinions in the record and “evaluate the persuasiveness” based 
on five “factors”: (1) supportability; (2) consistency; (3) relationship with the claimant; (4) 
specialization; and (5) any “other” factor that “tend[s] to support or contradict a medical opinion.” 
20 C.F.R. § 416.920c(a)-(c).                                               
    Notwithstanding the requirement to “consider” all of these factors, the ALJ’s duty to 
articulate a rationale for each factor varies. 20 C.F.R. § 416.1520c(a)-(b). Under the new 
regulations, the ALJ must “explain,” in all cases, “how [she] considered” both the supportability 
and consistency factors, as they are “the most important factors.” Id. § 416.920c(b)(2); see also 
Young, 2021 WL 4148733, at *9 (describing supportability and consistency as “the most 
important” of the five factors); Amber H. v. Saul, No. 3:20-CV-490 (ATB), 2021 WL 2076219, at 

*4 (N.D.N.Y. May 24, 2021) (noting that the two “most important factors for determining the 
persuasiveness of medical opinions are consistency and supportability,” the “same factors” that 

    3 The new regulations define “prior administrative medical finding” as: a “finding, other 
than the ultimate determination about whether you are disabled, about a medical issue made by our 
Federal and State agency medical and psychological consultants at a prior level of review (see § 
416.1400) in your current claim based on their review of the evidence in your case record, 
including but not limited to: (i) The existence and severity of your impairment(s); (ii) The existence 
and severity of your symptoms; (iii) Statements about whether your impairment(s) meets or 
medically equals any listing in the Listing of Impairments in Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1; (iv) 
If you are an adult, your [RFC]; (v) Whether your impairment(s) meets the duration requirement; 
and (vi) How failure to follow prescribed treatment (see § 416.930) and drug addiction and 
alcoholism (see § 416.935) relate to your claim.” 20 C.F.R. § 416.913(a)(5). 
formed the foundation of the treating physician rule). With respect to the supportability factor, “the 
strength of a medical opinion increases as the relevance of the objective medical evidence and 
explanations presented by the medical source increase.” Vellone v. Saul, No. 20-CV-261 (RA) 
(KHP), 2021 WL 319354, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2021) (citing 20 C.F.R. § 416.920c(c)(1)); see 
Rivera, 2020 WL 8167136, at *16 (noting that supportability “has to do with the fit between the 
medical opinion offered by the source and the underlying evidence and explanations ‘presented’ by 

that source to support [his or] her opinion”) (quoting 20 C.F.R. § 416.920c(c)(1)). Consistency, on 
the other hand, “is an all-encompassing inquiry focused on how well a medical source is supported, 
or not supported, by the entire record.” Vellone, 2021 WL 319354, at *6 (citing 20 C.F.R. § 
416.920c(c)(2)).                                                           
    As to the three remaining factors—relationship with the claimant, specialization, and 
“other”—the ALJ is required to consider, but need not explicitly discuss, them in determining the 
persuasiveness of the opinion of a medical source. 20 C.F.R. § 416.920c(b)(2). If the ALJ finds two 
or more medical opinions to be equally supported and consistent with the record, but not identical, 
the ALJ must articulate how she considered the three remaining factors. See id. § 416.920c(b)(3); 
see also Velasquez, 2021 WL 4392986, at *20. Thus, “[a]lthough the new regulations eliminate the 

perceived hierarchy of medical sources, deference to specific medical opinions, and assigning 
‘weight’ to a medication opinion, the ALJ must still ‘articulate how [she] considered the medical 
opinions’ and ‘how persuasive [she] find[s] all of the medical opinions.’” Andrew G. v. Comm’r of 
Soc. Sec., No. 3:19-CV-942 (ML), 2020 WL 5848776, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2020) (citations 
omitted). “If the ALJ fails adequately to ‘explain the supportability or consistency factors,’ or bases 
[his] explanation upon a misreading of the record, remand is required.” Rivera, 2020 WL 8167136, 
at *14 (quoting Andrew G., 2020 WL 5848776, at *9).                        
    Courts considering the application of the new regulations have concluded that “the factors 
are very similar to the analysis under the old [treating physician] rule.” Velasquez, 2021 WL

(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2021) (collecting cases considering the new regulations and concluding that “the 
essence” of the treating physician rule “remains the same, and the factors to be considered in 

weighing the various medical opinions in a given claimant’s medical history are substantially 
similar”), report and recommendation adopted by, 2022 WL 717612 (Mar. 10, 2022). “This is not 
surprising considering that, under the old rule, an ALJ had to determine whether a treating 
physician’s opinion was supported by well-accepted medical evidence and not inconsistent with the 
rest of the record before controlling weight could be assigned.” Acosta Cuevas, 2021 WL 363682,

supportability” were the foundation of the treating physician rule).       
                         Claimant’s Credibility                           
    An ALJ’s credibility finding as to the claimant’s disability is entitled to deference by a 
reviewing court. Osorio v. Barnhart, No. 04-CV-7515 (DLC), 2006 WL 1464193, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 

May 30, 2006). “[A]s with any finding of fact, ‘[i]f the [Commissioner’s] findings are supported by 
substantial evidence, the court must uphold the ALJ’s decision to discount a claimant’s subjective 
complaints.’” Id. (quoting Aponte v. Sec’y of Health and Hum. Servs., 728 F.2d 588, 591 (2d Cir. 
1984)) (first alteration in original). Still, an ALJ’s finding of credibility “must . . . be set forth with 
sufficient specificity to permit intelligible plenary review of the record.” Pena v. Astrue, No. 07-
CV-11099 (GWG), 2008 WL 5111317, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2008) (quoting Williams v. 
Bowen, 859 F.2d 255, 260-61 (2d Cir. 1988)). “The ALJ must make this [credibility] determination 
‘in light of the objective medical evidence and other evidence regarding the true extent of the 
alleged symptoms.’” Id. (quoting Mimms v. Heckler, 750 F.2d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 1984)). 
    SSA regulations provide that statements of subjective pain and other symptoms alone 
cannot establish a disability. Genier, 606 F.3d at 49 (2d Cir. 2010). The ALJ must follow a two-
step framework for evaluating allegations of pain and other limitations. Id. First, the ALJ considers 
whether the claimant suffers from a “medically determinable impairment that could reasonably be 

expected to produce” the symptoms alleged. Id.; see also 20 C.F.R. § 416.929(b). “If the claimant 
does suffer from such an impairment, at the second step, the ALJ must consider ‘the extent to 
which [the claimant’s] symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective 
medical evidence and other evidence’ of record.” Id. (quotation omitted); see also 20 C.F.R. 
§ 416.929(a). Among the kinds of evidence that the ALJ must consider (in addition to objective 
medical evidence) are:                                                     
    1. The individual’s daily activities; 2. [t]he location, duration, frequency, and 
    intensity of the individual’s pain or other symptoms; 3. [f]actors that precipitate and 
    aggravate the symptoms; 4. [t]he type, dosage, effectiveness, and side effects of any 
    medication the individual takes or has taken to alleviate pain or other symptoms; 5. 
    [t]reatment, other than medication, the individual receives or has received for relief 
    of pain or other symptoms; 6. [a]ny measures other than treatment the individual 
    uses or has used to relieve pain or other symptoms (e.g., lying flat on his back, 
    standing for 15 to 20 minutes every hour, or sleeping on a board); and 7. [a]ny other 
    factors concerning the individual’s functional limitations and restrictions due to pain 
    or other symptoms.

  B.  The ALJ’s Decision                                                  
    On November 14, 2019, the ALJ issued her decision, R. at 19-33, finding that Nunez was 
not disabled under the Act. Id. at 33. The ALJ began by explaining the five-step process for 
determining whether an individual is disabled. Id. at 23-24.               
    At step one, the ALJ found that Nunez had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since 
August 22, 2018. Id. at 25. At step two, the ALJ found that Nunez had three severe impairments: 
(1) asthma, (2) agoraphobia with panic disorder, and (3) generalized anxiety behavior.4 Id. The 
ALJ also noted Nunez’s non-severe impairments: headaches, vertigo, and gastroesophageal reflux 
disease. Id.                                                               
    At step three, the ALJ found that Nunez “does not have an impairment or combination of 

impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20 CFR 
Part 404, subpart P, Appendix 1 (20 CFR 404.1520(a), 404.1525, 404.1426, 416.920(d), 416.925 
and 416.926).” Id. at 25-27. In assessing Nunez’s mental impairments, the ALJ applied evidence in 
the record to each of the “four broad functional areas” (known as “paragraph B” criteria), 
including: (1) understanding, remembering, or applying information; (2) interacting with others; (3) 
concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace; and (4) adapting or managing oneself. Id. at 26-27. 
The ALJ concluded that Nunez’s mental impairments caused moderate limitations in the functional 
areas of: (1) understanding, remembering or applying information; (2) interacting with others; and 
(3) concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace. Id. The ALJ also determined that Nunez’s 
mental impairments caused mild limitations in the functional area of adapting or managing oneself. 

Id. at 26. The ALJ concluded that because Nunez’s “mental impairments do not cause at least two 
‘marked’ limitations or one ‘extreme’ limitation, the ‘paragraph B’ criteria are not satisfied.” Id. at 
27. Additionally, the ALJ concluded that Nunez “does not meet the ‘paragraph C’ criteria of listing 
12.04 and 12.06,” because “[t]he record fails to demonstrate a medically documented history of the 
existence of a serious and persistent mental health disorder over a period of at least 2 years, along 


    4In his motion, Nunez does not dispute the ALJ’s findings related to his physical 
impairments. He challenges only the ALJ’s findings pertaining to his mental impairments. Pl.’s Br. 
at 1 n. 5. Therefore, the Court does not address the ALJ’s findings concerning Plaintiff’s asthma. 
with evidence of medical treatment, mental health therapy, psychosocial support, or a highly 
structured setting that is ongoing and that diminishes the symptoms and signs of the mental 
disorder.” Id. Further, the ALJ found that “there is no evidence of a marginal adjustment, that is, 
minimal capacity to adapt to changes in the environment or to demands that are not already part of 
the daily life.” Id.                                                       
    Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ found, “[a]fter careful consideration of the entire 

record,” that Nunez maintained the RFC “to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but 
with” certain non-exertional limitations. Id. Specifically, the ALJ found that Nunez “cannot operate 
a motor vehicle as an occupational requirement, nor work at unprotected eights or around moving 
mechanical parts”; Nunez can perform “work that requires him to understand, remember, and carry 
out instructions consistent with occupations that can be learned in up to 30 days”; Nunez “requires 
a setting that is goal-oriented versus requiring that he maintain a specific pace consistent 
throughout the day”; and Nunez “can tolerate occasional interaction with the public, and remains 
able to interact appropriately with supervisors and co-workers.” Id.       
    In considering Nunez’s symptoms, the ALJ followed the established two-step process: (1) 
determining whether there was an underlying medically determinable physical or mental 

impairment; and (2) if such an impairment was shown, evaluating the “intensity, persistence, and 
limiting effects of the claimant’s symptoms to determine the extent to which they limit the 
claimant’s functional limitations.” Id. at 27-28. The ALJ analyzed Nunez’s impairments, and after 
considering the evidence, found that even though Nunez’s “medically determinable impairments 
could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms,” Nunez’s “statements concerning the 
intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms [were] not entirely consistent with the 
medical evidence and other evidence in the record.” Id. at 28. The ALJ also independently 
evaluated each of the medical opinions and prior administrative medical findings, and determined 
whether each opinion was “persuasive,” “partially persuasive,” or “not persuasive.” Id. at 29-31. 
    At step four, the ALJ found that Nunez was unable to perform the work of a security guard, 
his past relevant work. Id. at 31. At step five, the ALJ considered Nunez’s “age, education, work 
experience, and [RFC],” and found that “there [were] jobs that exist in significant numbers in the 
national economy that [Nunez] can perform.” Id. at 32. Based on testimony from a vocational 

expert (“VE”) and in conjunction with the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, the ALJ concluded that 
Nunez was “not disabled” because he could perform a limited range of light work and was 
“capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the 
national economy.” Id. The ALJ cited the VE’s testimony that given Nunez’s age, education, work 
experience and RFC, such an individual would be able to perform work as a: (1) final assembler 
(DOT No. 789.687-046); (2) packager (DOT 559.687-074); and (3) product assembler (DOT No. 
739.687-030).5 Id. Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Nunez “has not been under a disability” 
within the meaning of the Act “from August 22, 2018,” the alleged onset date, “through the date of 
[the] decision.” Id. (citing 20 CFR 404.1520(g) and 416.920(g)).           
  C.  Analysis                                                            

    Nunez attacks the ALJ’s determination on three grounds. Nunez asserts that the ALJ failed 
to properly: (1) evaluate the medical opinion evidence; (2) determine Nunez’s RFC; and (3) 
evaluate Nunez’s subjective complaints about his symptoms. Pl.’s Br. at 11-25. For the reasons 
explained below, the ALJ properly evaluated both the medical opinion evidence and Nunez’s 
subjective complaints. Further, substantial evidence supports the ALJ’s determination that Nunez’s 
medically determinable impairments, although severe, do not prevent him from performing work, 


    5 The ALJ also noted that she found the VE’s testimony to be “consistent with the 
information contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.” R. at 32.  
with limitations as identified by the VE, and thus do not render him disabled under the Act. 
Accordingly, the Commissioner’s cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted and the 
ALJ’s decision is affirmed.                                                
       1.  The ALJ properly evaluated the medical opinions of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and 
         Ellis.                                                           

    In her assessment of the medical evidence, the ALJ determined that the medical opinions of 
treating psychiatrist and therapist Patrick Schulte, M.D., and examining psychologists Glenn 
Bromley, Ph.D. and James K. Ellis, Ph.D. were not persuasive. R. at 30-31. Nunez asserts that the 
ALJ erred because she failed “to consider evidence related to the supportability and consistency of 
the assessments from [Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis].” Pl.’s Br. at 15. The Commissioner 
counters that “the ALJ weighed the medical opinions in accordance with the Commissioner’s 
regulations, and articulated substantial evidence in support of the . . . credibility findings.” Def.’s 
Br. at 21. For the reasons set forth below, the ALJ properly considered evidence relating to the 
supportability and consistency of the findings of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis, and sufficiently 
explained her findings.                                                    
    Because Nunez’s application was filed after March 27, 2017, the ALJ must consider the 
medical opinions in the record based on the following five factors: (1) supportability; (2) 
consistency; (3) relationship with the claimant; (4) specialization; and (5) any “other” factor that 
“tend[s] to support or contradict a medical opinion.” 20 C.F.R. § 416.920c(a)-(c). Although the 
ALJ must “consider” all these factors, under the new regulations the ALJ must only “explain” how 
she considered the “most important factors” of supportability and consistency. 20 C.F.R. §§ 
416.1520c(a)-(b), (b)(2). Nunez argues that the ALJ failed to do exactly that with regard to the 

medical opinions of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis. Pl.’s Br. at 19. Nunez is mistaken. A review 
of the ALJ’s decision demonstrates that she considered the relevant evidence and discussed the 
supportability and consistency factors when weighing the opinions of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and 
Ellis, explicitly outlining why she found each opinion more or less persuasive. R. at 28-31. The 
ALJ articulated how the opinions of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis were not supported by or 
consistent with underlying medical evidence in the record, including cites to each doctor’s own 
treatment notes and mental examinations of Nunez. Id. Further, substantial evidence in the 
underlying record supports the ALJ’s determinations as to those medical opinions.  

    Beginning with Dr. Schulte, the ALJ properly found that Dr. Schulte’s opinions regarding 
Nunez’s inability to work and limited ability to adapt to, and use, public transportation, were not 
persuasive. Id. at 30. Dr. Schulte opined that Nunez was unable to work because of his panic 
attacks. Id. at 406, 722. Dr. Schulte rendered that opinion on November 27, 2018, and again on 
June 11, 2019. Id. Prior to that, Dr. Schulte had been treating Nunez for his panic disorder since 
November 2016. Id. at 309. In May 2018, Nunez started to experience a reemergence of panic 
attacks that were previously stable. Id. at 298. Dr. Schulte reported that Nunez had been taking the 
prescription medication Lexapro, but was in the midst of a “taper off” of the medication when his 
panic attacks reemerged. Id. However, Dr. Schulte’s treatment notes after June 2018, when Nunez 
started taking Lexapro again, demonstrate that Nunez’s condition stabilized and improved with 

treatment and medication. Id.                                              
    For example, in a September 2018 examination, Dr. Schulte reported that Nunez was less 
anxious and appeared calm and cooperative. Id. Nunez reported that he had been using various 
“cognitive behavioral techniques” that had been helpful in subsiding his panic-attack symptoms 
and residual anxiety. Id. at 298-99. Nunez also reported that he had continued to use the subway 
without experiencing symptoms of agoraphobia, and that he did not have any catastrophic or 
intrusive thoughts, or any manic or psychotic symptoms. Id. In October 2018, Nunez reported to 
Dr. Schulte that he began attending a weekly panic and anxiety therapy group and that his anxiety 
had been “well-controlled.” Id. at 346. Dr. Schulte reported that during that examination, Nunez 
was “hyperventilating, [and] pacing around the office,” but that he responded “well to grounding 
exercise and deep breathing.” Id. In November 2018, Nunez reported to Dr. Schulte that he 
continued to attend weekly therapy meetings and that his anxiety had been “more manageable.” Id. 
at 335. Nunez also reported “having less catastrophic thinking,” and was taking his medication 
(Lexapro) with no adverse effects. Id. In December 2018, Dr. Schulte reported that Nunez had been 

wholly compliant with the treatment recommendations and had started to incorporate “progressive 
muscle relaxation,” and “physical exercise and yoga,” which had “been helpful for his anxiety.” Id. 
at 453.                                                                    
    In January 2019, Nunez reported to Dr. Schulte that his anxiety had continued to become 
“more manageable.” Id. at 421. Nunez indicated that he had continued to ride the subway more 
often without company, but reported being fearful of the train and experiencing symptoms of 
shortness of breath and tachycardia when in the subway station. Id. Dr. Schulte discussed with 
Nunez ways he could continue to manage his anxiety while traveling alone on the subway, and 
reported that Nunez responded well to “reframing” and “cognitive restructuring.” Id. Dr. Schulte 
also reported that Nunez had continued attending the weekly psychosocial group and that he 

engaged in more physical exercise and yoga, which had been helpful in treating his anxiety. Id. at 
422. In February 2019, Dr. Schulte reported that Nunez’s objective mental-status examinations 
revealed improved anxiety, less panic attacks, “calm” motor activity, “normal” speech, and “fair” 
insight and judgment. Id. at 415. In April 2019, Nunez reported “interval improvement in anxiety,” 
and stated that he had been keeping busy by visiting family and volunteering. Id. at 663. Dr. 
Schulte reported that Nunez had continued doing “progressive muscle relaxation exercise and 
visualization exercises” with “good effect” and that he continued to engage in physical exercise 
and yoga, which continued to help treat his anxiety. Id. In May 2019, Nunez reported that he 
continued with “progressive muscle relaxation and visualization exercises” with “good effect,” in 
addition to attending the psychosocial group weekly and adhering to the Lexapro with no adverse 
effects. Id. at 657.  By June 2019, Nunez continued with the Lexapro and he reported “improved 
management” of his anxiety to Dr. Schulte. Id. at 645-46. Nunez reported that he was able to 
manage panic-attack symptoms using the prescription medication Atarax. Id. at 645. Dr. Schulte 
reported that Nunez continued to stay busy with visiting family, volunteering, physical exercise, 

and yoga. Id. at 645-46.                                                   
    As this discussion illustrates, Dr. Schulte’s own treatment notes during a period of nearly a 
year demonstrate that Nunez’s anxiety and panic attacks continuously improved with medication 
and other treatment regiments and had stabilized. By June 2019, Dr. Schulte’s treatment notes 
indicate that Nunez was able to manage his anxiety and panic attacks, allowing him to leave his 
house, visit family, and engage in volunteer activities. R. at 645. For this reason, Dr. Schulte’s 
opinion that Nunez was unable to work because of his panic attacks is not consistent with the 
medical evidence or supported by his own treatment notes, as the ALJ explained. Id. at 30. Instead, 
as the ALJ reasoned, the objective mental-status examinations by Dr. Schulte from September 2018 
to June 2019 revealed continuous improvement in Nunez’s anxiety and panic attacks and showed 

that Nunez’s condition could be adequately managed with medication and treatment therapies. The 
ALJ discussed this evidence in her decision and articulated that the improvement in Nunez’s 
condition, as reported by Dr. Schulte, did not support Dr. Schulte’s finding that Nunez is unable to 
work due to the frequency of his panic attacks and depression. Id. The ALJ’s determination 
adequately reflects that she considered the supportability and consistency of Dr. Schulte’s medical 
opinion, as assessed against the rest of the evidence in the record.       
    Next, the ALJ also properly found that Dr. Bromley’s finding of marked limitations was not 
persuasive. Id. The ALJ explained that Dr. Bromley’s opinion that Nunez had marked limitations in 
understanding, remembering, and applying complex directions and instructions, regulating 
emotion, controlling behavior, and maintaining well-being were “not supported and consistent” 
because “aside from some anxiety and panic attacks, [Nunez] was mentally stable.” Id. Here, too, 
the ALJ explained how she considered the supportability and consistency factors as it related to Dr. 
Bromley’s opinion.                                                         
    Dr. Bromley examined Nunez once, in November 2018. Id. at 328-32. As the ALJ 

recounted, Dr. Bromley’s notes indicated that Nunez had “appropriate” grooming, motor activities, 
and speech; despite some anxiety, he only had mildly impaired attention, concentration, and 
memory. Id. at 329-330. During the consultative examination with Dr. Bromley, Nunez reported 
feeling anxious and shaking, and Dr. Bromley recalled that Nunez had “borderline” intellectual 
functioning. Id. at 330. However, Nunez reported that his medications helped his symptoms, and 
Nunez also reported being able to dress, bathe, and groom himself, do basic cooking and food 
preparation, clean and shop by himself, and manage his own money. Id. at 329, 331. Nunez also 
reported socializing with friends and family members. Id. Dr. Bromley’s ultimate assessment was 
that Nunez had “fair” insight and that his prognosis remained “fair.” Id. at 332. The ALJ discussed 
this evidence in her decision and explained that Dr. Bromley’s own treatment and examination 

notes indicated that Nunez was “benefit[ting] from the medications and his panic attacks had 
lessened.” Id. at 30. The ALJ thus adequately explained how she considered the supportability and 
consistency factors as it relates to Dr. Bromley’s opinion.                
    Finally, the ALJ properly found that Dr. Ellis’ finding of marked limitations was not 
persuasive. Id. at 31. Dr. Ellis opined that Nunez had marked limitations in concentrating and 
maintaining pace, as well as in interacting with others and that Nunez would miss more than three 
workdays per month. The ALJ explained that Dr. Ellis’ opinion was not consistent with the 
treatment records from Drs. Schulte and Bromley and was also inconsistent with, and not supported 
by, Dr. Ellis’ own psychiatric evaluation of Nunez from August 2019. Id. During that evaluation, 
although Nunez reported intrusive dreams, panic attacks, and social anxiety, Dr. Ellis found that 
Nunez had full orientation, and “logical” and “linear” thought process. Id. at 729-31. Further, 
Nunez reported compliance with his Lexapro and Atarax prescriptions and denied any adverse side 
effects to the medications. Id. at 730. Ultimately, Dr. Ellis found that Nunez had no perceptual 
disturbances or impaired concentration or attention, and reported that Nunez had “good” impulse 

control and “fair” insight and judgment. Id. As the ALJ reasonably observed, Dr. Ellis’ own 
psychiatric evaluation revealed that Nunez remained mentally stable, his contrary opinion 
notwithstanding. Id. at 29. The ALJ’s discussion adequately explained how Dr. Ellis’s opinion was 
not consistent or supported by the record evidence. Id.                    
    As the ALJ explained in her decision, the underlying medical evidence shows that from 
May 2018 to August 2019, Nunez’s panic disorder improved as he continued to respond to 
medication and treatment, and Nunez exhibited less anxiety and suffered fewer panic attacks. 
During this period, Nunez remained under the ongoing treatment of Dr. Schulte, who noted these 
improvements at monthly examinations. These improvements were also documented by Drs. 
Bromley and Ellis in their examinations of Nunez. Contrary to Nunez’s argument, the ALJ did not 

disregard the longitudinal treatment records. Pl.’s Br. at 17. To be sure, those records showed that 
Nunez’s anxiety was persistent. But other evidence showed a sustained upward trajectory in 
Nunez’s condition due to treatment and medication, and that Nunez’s symptoms were managed in a 
way that still allowed him to engage in normal activities. In short, the ALJ’s assessment of the 
medical opinions is supported by substantial evidence, and therefore her determination must be 
upheld even if other evidence in the record may suggest a contrary conclusion. See Bonet ex rel. 
T.B. v. Colvin, 523 F.App’x 58, 59 (2d Cir. 2013) (summary order) (“[W]hether there is substantial 
evidence supporting the [claimant’s] view is not the question here; rather, we must decide whether 
substantial evidence supports the ALJ’s decision.”) (citations omitted; emphasis in original). 
    Nunez’s arguments attacking the ALJ’s determination are meritless. First, the ALJ did not 
ignore Nunez’s diagnoses. Pl.’s Br. at 17-18. Indeed, she found that Nunez’s severe impairments 
included agoraphobia with panic disorder and generalized anxiety behavior, R. at 25, but ultimately 
found that Nunez was not as functionally limited as the doctors opined, id. at 31. To the extent the 

record contained inconsistences or conflicting evaluations of Nunez’s condition, it is within the 
ALJ’s purview to resolve those conflicts. See Veino v. Barnhart, 312 F.3d 578, 588 (2d Cir. 2002) 
(“Genuine conflicts in the medical evidence are for the Commissioner to resolve.”) (citation 
omitted); Herrera v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 20-CV-7910 (KHP), 2021 WL 4909955, at *9 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 2021) (upholding ALJ’s determination which “noted and discussed” conflicting 
medical evidence and “arrived at a decision based on the record as a whole”).  
    Nor did the ALJ substitute her judgment for that of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis. Pl.’s 
Reply Br. at 1-2. Instead, the ALJ’s findings reconciled the doctors’ examinations and treatment 
notes with their final opinions. Additionally, the ALJ did not err, as Nunez argues, by discounting 
Dr. Schulte’s opinion as to Nunez’s inability to work, because this is a determination reserved to 

the Commissioner. Pl.’s Br. at 14. And while the ultimate determination of disability is indeed 
reserved to the Commissioner, Revi v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 16-CV-08521 (ER) (DF), 2018 
WL 1136997, at *30 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, 2018 WL 
1135400 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2018) (citations omitted), the ALJ’s decision illustrates that she did 
not simply discount Dr. Schulte’s opinion. As discussed, the ALJ explained why Dr. Schulte’s 
opinion was not supported by, or consistent with, the underlying medical evidence. R. at 30-31. 
    Contrary to Nunez’s argument, the totality of the record does not support a finding that 
what Nunez experienced were “transient” or isolated “periods of stability.” Pl.’s Br. at 18. Instead, 
as the ALJ concluded, the underlying record amply demonstrated that Nunez’s condition had 
improved over a sustained period of time. See supra pp. 17-19. And, this improvement was 
documented by Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis, based on their respective observations of Nunez 
and Nunez’s own statements regarding his condition. In her decision, the ALJ described how that 
evidence supported her findings that the opinions of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis were not 
persuasive, citing specific medical facts and observations made by each doctor. R. at 30-31.  

    In sum, because the ALJ’s decision reflects that she considered the supportability and 
consistency factors as they relate to the opinions of Drs. Schulte, Bromley, and Ellis, and because 
her findings are supported by substantial evidence, the weight the ALJ assigned to each opinion 
must be upheld.                                                            
       2.  Substantial evidence supports the ALJ’s RFC determination.     
    In her RFC determination, the ALJ found that Nunez’s mental impairments imposed 
significant restrictions, but did not prevent him from performing a limited range of simple, 
unskilled work.6 R. at 31. Accounting for Nunez’s mental impairments, the ALJ stated that Nunez 
“cannot work at unprotected heights or around moving mechanical parts.” Id. The ALJ also stated 
that Nunez “is able to perform the demands of work that requires him to understand, remember, 

and carry out instructions consistent with occupations that can be learned in up to 30 days.” Id. The 
ALJ limited Nunez to a work environment with “occasional interaction with the public,” but stated 
that he “remains able to interact appropriately with supervisors and co-workers.” Id. Finally, the 



    6 “Unskilled work” is defined by the Social Security regulations as “work which needs little 
or no judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time. The job 
may or may not require considerable strength. . .[A] person can usually learn to do [an unskilled] 
job in 30 days, and little specific vocational preparation and judgment are needed.” See 20 C.F.R. § 
404.1568(a); 20 C.F.R. § 416.968(a).                                       
ALJ stated that Nunez “requires a setting that is goal-oriented versus requiring that he maintain[ ] a 
specific pace consistent throughout the day.” Id.                          
    Nunez asserts that there is “no linkage” between the ALJ’s RFC finding and any evidence 
in the record, and that the ALJ erred because she did not cite to any “specific medical facts or 
persuasive non-medical evidence” in support of her RFC finding. Pl.’s Br. at 21. Further, Nunez 
states that the ALJ’s finding is flawed because her conclusion conflicts with Dr. Bromley’s finding 

of mild and moderate limitations, which the ALJ found persuasive, and that she failed to explain 
the conflict in her reasoning. Id. at 21-22. Defendant counters that evidence in the record supports 
the ALJ’s RFC finding. Def.’s Br. at 26-27. Here, not only did the ALJ properly articulate her 
reasoning, but substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ’s RFC determination. She 
therefore properly crafted Nunez’s RFC.                                    
    In assessing Nunez’s RFC, the ALJ explicitly mentioned Nunez’s previous mental 
evaluations and history of anxiety and panic attacks. R. at 31. Moreover, the evidence referred to 
by the ALJ indicates that Nunez benefited from medication and treatment, and that he appeared 
mentally stable and cooperative at numerous mental-status examinations. Id. For example, the ALJ 
noted that just a few months after starting Lexapro, Dr. Schulte reported that Nunez himself 

admitted to benefiting from treatment and the medication. Id. at 28. The ALJ noted, and the record 
supports, see supra pp. 17-19, that Nunez’s condition improved and remained stable while taking 
Lexapro and while under the continued care of Dr. Schulte. R. at 28-29. The record also shows that 
from December 2018 to June 2019, Nunez was regularly attending group therapy sessions under 
the care of Karen Merns, Ph.D. as part of his treatment, throughout the course of which Nunez 
reported improvement in his anxiety. See, e.g., id. at, 337, 344 351, 352, 412, 418, 427, 444, 451, 
458, 459, 466, 473, 474 481, 482.                                          
    The ALJ also described how Nunez’s improvement was observed not only by Dr. Schulte, 
but also by other examining doctors. For example, the ALJ noted that in November 2018, Dr. 
Bromley observed that Nunez “had appropriate grooming, motor activities, speech, and . . . only 
‘mildly’ impaired attention, concentration and memory,” and that he described Nunez’s prognosis 
as “fair.” R. at 28. The ALJ also noted that a psychiatric evaluation by Solomon Miskin, M.D. in 
January 2019, revealed that Nunez’s conditions were “unremarkable,” with Dr. Miskin observing 

that Nunez “was neatly dressed, appropriately groomed fully oriented, and coherent,” and “had 
grossly intact memory, calculation skills, and good insight and judgment.” R. at 29. Additionally, 
the ALJ noted that a mental-status examination of Nunez by Dr. Merns in April to June 2019 
revealed “improved anxiety and panic attacks, as well as concrete thought process and no evidence 
of suicidal or homicidal thoughts.” Id. Finally, the ALJ noted that an August 2019 psychiatric 
evaluation by Dr. Ellis showed that Nunez “was mentally stable,” and that he had “full orientation 
and logical thought process.” Id. Collectively, the treatment notes from various doctors, spanning a 
period of approximately fifteen months, provide substantial evidence for the ALJ’s RFC 
determination.                                                             
    The ALJ also explained that evidence in the record supported Nunez’s ability to perform 

basic daily activities, such as shopping at the store and using public transportation. R. 28. The ALJ 
pointed to evidence in the record showing that Nunez could perform daily personal-care activities, 
and that he appeared at many medical examinations appropriately groomed. Id. at 26. The ALJ also 
noted that there were no reported issues of Nunez interacting with medical staff, and that during his 
evaluations, doctors described him as “pleasant and cooperative.” Id. The record also indicates that 
Nunez would leave his house to interact with family members, attend church, walk in the park, and 
attend weekly group therapy sessions with Dr. Merns and monthly examinations with Dr. Schulte. 
Id. at 56-57, 298, 309, 335, 337, 344, 346, 351, 352, 412, 414, 418, 421 427, 444, 451, 458, 459, 
466, 473, 474, 481, 482, 654, 647, 663. Courts have found that a claimant’s ability to perform 
similar basic activities can properly support an ALJ’s determination that the claimant has an RFC 
to perform light work, subject to specified modifications. See Acevedo v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 
21-CV-10621 (KHP), 2023 WL 1433648, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2023) (finding that an RFC 
determination that limited the plaintiff to simple, routine, and repetitive tasks, a low-stress work 
environment, and occasional contact with others was consistent with mild to moderate limitations 

where the plaintiff was able to regularly take medication, able to shop, attend medical 
appointments and church, and sometimes use public transportation, even with some anxiety) 
(collecting cases); see also Cichocki v. Astrue, 729 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir. 2013) (upholding an 
RFC to perform light work that relied, in part, on the plaintiff’s indication that she performed 
numerous daily tasks, such as walking her dogs and cleaning her house); Browne v. Comm’r of 
Soc. Sec., 131 F. Supp. 3d 89, 101 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (upholding ALJ’s conclusion that a plaintiff’s 
could perform light work based on reports that the plaintiff could do household chores, go out 
alone and take public transportation, attend medical appointments several times per week, and walk 
for five blocks); Simmons v. Colvin, No. 13-CV-1724 (KBF), 2014 WL 104811, at *5-6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Jan. 8, 2014) (finding a plaintiff’s testimony that she could walk several blocks and did her own 

cooking, cleaning, and laundry provided substantial evidence for an RFC finding which limited 
plaintiff to light work).                                                  
    Contrary to Nunez’s argument, Pl.’s Br. at 21-22, the ALJ correctly considered Dr. 
Bromley’s findings that Nunez had mild to moderate limitations, which she found persuasive, in 
crafting Nunez’s RFC, R. at 30. Dr. Bromley concluded that Nunez had mild to moderate 
limitations in understanding, remembering, and applying simple directions and instructions, using 
reasoning and judgment, interacting with others, sustaining concentration and performing tasks, 
and sustaining order routine and regular attendance. See id.; see also id. at 328-32. Consistent with 
this conclusion, the ALJ limited Nunez to specific work conditions that reflected his limitations. 
Nunez has not shown that Dr. Bromley’s finding of mild to moderate limitations requires a more 
limited RFC. See Martinez v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 13-CV-159 (KMK)(JCM), 2016 WL 
6885181, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 WL 6884905 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2016) (concluding that an RFC finding of unskilled work was consistent with a 
consultative examiner’s opinion that plaintiff was able to follow and understand directions, 

occasionally deal with members of the public, and relate to coworkers); see also Landers v. Colvin, 
No. 14-CV-1090S, 2016 WL 1211283, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2016) (finding that an RFC of 
simple, repetitive, and routine work accounted for moderate limitations in maintaining regular 
attendance); Shannon v. Berryhill, No. 16-CV-06796, 2018 WL 6592181, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 
13, 2018) (“There is significant case law indicating that the ALJ’s limitation of Plaintiff to ‘simple, 
routine tasks’ . . . accounts for her limitations for performing activities within a schedule and 
maintaining regular attendance.”) (collecting cases). Additionally, the ALJ’s RFC determination is 
consistent with Dr. Bromley’s findings, though the ALJ was not required to directly reconcile her 
finding with Dr. Bromley’s opinion, as Nunez suggests, Pl.’s Br. 21-22. See Landers, 2016 WL 
1211283, at *4 (“[A]n ALJ need not call out every moderate limitation by name, provided that the 

RFC appropriately reflects such limitations.”); see also Vecchio v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 20-
CV-8105 (MKV) (SLC), 2021 WL 8013772, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2021), report and 
recommendation adopted, 2022 WL 873175 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2022) (“That the ALJ deemed 
only a portion of [a] medical opinion to be persuasive . . . was not an act of impermissible cherry-
picking . . . because the ALJ explained that a portion of her opinion was unpersuasive because it is 
inconsistent with the totality of the medical evidence in the record, including unremarkable mental 
status examinations.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).                 
    After articulating the evidence supporting her conclusion, the ALJ tailored her RFC finding 
to account for Nunez’s mental-health symptoms by limiting Nunez to low-stress work with only 
occasional decision making, and only occasional interaction with the public. R. at 31. The narrow 
tailoring of the ALJ’s determination makes it apparent that the ALJ considered the entire record in 
crafting the RFC, which fully accounted for Nunez’s impairments. See Anzola v. Berryhill, No. 18-
CV-11217 (VSB) (DCF), 2019 WL 10630956, at *20 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2019), report and 

recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 5646329 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2020) (concluding RFC 
determination that included restrictions based on the plaintiff’s limitations appropriately considered 
a medical opinion and was supported by substantial evidence); see also Matthew E. v. Saul, No. 
19-CV-6877L, 2021 WL 695103, at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2021) (reasoning that where an ALJ 
narrowly tailored his RFC finding to account for plaintiff’s mental-health symptoms by limiting 
plaintiff to simple, routine and repetitive tasks, low-stress work with only occasional decision 
making, and no more than occasional interaction with others, the RFC adequately accounted for 
plaintiff’s moderate-to-marked stress-related limitations); DeJesus v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec., No. 20-
CV-6815 (KHP), 2021 WL 5829766, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 8, 2021) (affirming RFC 
determination where “[i]mportantly, the ALJ did not ignore but rather acknowledged [the 

plaintiff’s] symptoms . . . but nevertheless found that the[y] were not so disabling as to preclude 
Plaintiff from working with appropriate limitations”). In short, the ALJ’s RFC determination is 
supported by substantial evidence and therefore must be upheld.            
       3.  The ALJ properly assessed Nunez’s subjective complaints about his symptoms. 
    Lastly, Nunez asserts that the ALJ failed to explain her reasoning with sufficient specificity 
as to how she assessed his subjective complaints about his symptoms. Pl.’s Br. at 23-25. Defendant 
counters that “[t]he ALJ provided sufficient analysis as to why Nunez’s symptoms were not as 
severe, persistent or limited as he had alleged, by considering the regulatory factors.” Def.’s Br. at 
29. For the reasons explained below, the ALJ sufficiently explained her reasoning, and therefore 
did not err in assessing Nunez’s subjective complaints about his symptoms.  
    The ALJ’s decision reflects that she considered Nunez’s subjective complaints concerning 
his anxiety and panic attacks, but, based on the medical record as a whole, determined that Nunez 
had responded to medication and that his condition had improved over the course of his treatment. 
R. at 28. At the August 2019 hearing, Nunez explained to the ALJ how his conditions had 

worsened, including that he experienced frequent daily panic attacks. Id. at 48-50. Nunez testified 
that due to his panic attacks, he had trouble taking public transportation and interacting with others. 
Id. at 53, 57. In his Function Report, Nunez described difficulty socializing with friends and 
family, and difficulty completing personal care, such as bathing. Id. at 214-21. During his 
psychological consultative examination, Nunez reported depressive mood, chronic panic disorder, 
and difficulty remembering and concentrating. Id. at 329. The ALJ acknowledged all these 
statements concerning Nunez’s condition in her decision, id. at 26, but explained, citing to the 
record, that Nunez had responded well to his medications, and that his condition was improving. Id. 
at 28-31. Thus, the ALJ determined that while Nunez’s “medically determinable impairments could 
reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms,” Nunez’s “statements concerning the 

intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely consistent with the 
medical evidence and other evidence in the record.” Id. at 28.             
    The ALJ’s decision demonstrates that she identified specific record-based reasons to 
support her determination, including findings from multiple doctors showing Nunez’s sustained 
improvement, and Nunez’s own statements indicating an improvement in his condition with 
medication and treatment. See Reices-Colon v. Astrue, 523 F. App’x 796, 799 (2d Cir. 2013) 
(affirming decision where substantial evidence supported ALJ’s finding that plaintiff showed 
improvement following treatment); see also Hollaway v. Colvin, No. 14-CV-5165 (RA) (HBP), 
2016 WL 96172, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 WL 
1275658 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2016) (finding ALJ made a proper credibility determination and “did 
not completely reject plaintiff’s complaints of pain or physical limitations, but rather found that 
given the overall record, plaintiff’s medically determinable impairments would allow for the 
performance of ‘a limited range of light work’”).                          
    Ultimately, the ALJ is “not required to accept the claimant’s subjective complaints without 

question”; she is permitted to discount Nunez’s testimony and subjective statements based on the 
record as a whole. See Genier, 606 F.3d at 49 (citations omitted). The ALJ appropriately did so 
here, and for the reasons discussed, her determination with respect to Nunez’s credibility and her 
finding that Nunez could perform the limited range of simple, unskilled work was supported by 
substantial evidence. See Johnson, 563 F. Supp. 2d at 454 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (holding that “[i]f the 
reviewing court finds substantial evidence to support the Commissioner’s final decision, that decision 
must be upheld”).                                                          
                                CONCLUSION 
     For the foregoing reasons, Nunez’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED and 
the Commissioner’s cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED. The Clerk of 
Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 19 and 26.
