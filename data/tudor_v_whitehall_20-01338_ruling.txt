                        Plaintiff,                    (GLS/CFH)

WHITEHALL CENTRAL SCHOOL
DISTRICT,

                   Defendant.
________________________________

                            SUMMARY ORDER

      Plaintiff Angel Tudor brings this action against defendant Whitehall

Central School District alleging a failure to accommodate claim1 pursuant

to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).2 (Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 9.)

Now pending is the District’s motion for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 22.)

For the reasons that follow, the District’s motion is granted.

      The District is a public school district located in Washington County,

New York. (Def.’s Statement of Material Facts (SMF) ¶ 1, Dkt. No. 22,




      1
        Tudor originally alleged additional claims pursuant to New York
State Human Rights Law and New York Executive Law, however, the
parties stipulated to their dismissal. (Dkt. No. 16.)
      2
          See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-213.

Attach. 1.)3 Tudor has been an employee of the District since 2006 as a

substitute teacher, and, subsequently, as a full-time teacher. (Id. ¶ 2.)

Patrick Dee is the District’s Superintendent, and Brian Keller is the

Principal of the District’s Junior-Senior High School. (Id. ¶¶ 3-4.) Tudor

has sought accommodations from the District for her Post-Traumatic

Stress Disorder (PTSD). (Id. ¶ 7.) The District asserts that Tudor sought

“the ability to take three, uninterrupted breaks of at least fifteen minutes in

duration each day during which [Tudor] was permitted to leave” school

grounds. (Id. ¶ 8.) Tudor objects to this characterization of her

accommodation request, maintaining that she only requested two fifteen-

minute breaks, and that a third break, during lunch, “was not requested nor

provided as an accommodation but was provided as matter of law

irrespective any accommodation request.” (Pl.’s SMF ¶ 8, Dkt. No. 32.)

       3
         Unless noted otherwise, the facts are undisputed. To the extent
Tudor disputes any of the facts asserted by the District, but fails to cite
record support that shows an actual dispute, the fact is deemed admitted
pursuant to Local Rule 56.1(b). Further, to the extent Tudor asserts
additional facts or makes arguments in her responsive paragraphs that do
not directly dispute the facts alleged in the District’s statement, these
“facts” and arguments will not be considered in connection with this
summary judgment motion “because they have not been submitted
through the procedure outlined by N.D.N.Y. L.R. [56].” See Lomonoco v.
Saint Anne Inst., No. 1:15-CV-1163, 2018 WL 2324051, at *1 (N.D.N.Y.
May 22, 2018).

     During the 2019-2020 school year, the period at issue here, (id. ¶¶

70, 73, 76-78; see Am. Compl. ¶ 76), Tudor was only required to report to

work in-person for one hundred days of the 2019-2020 school year, with

the remainder of the school year being conducted remotely as a result of

the COVID-19 pandemic. (Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 51-52, 54.) On the one hundred

days Tudor was required to work in person during the 2019-2020 school

year, she was permitted to take a break every morning during her “prep

period,” and also took a break during her lunch. (Id. ¶¶ 44-45.)

Additionally, the District asserts that Keller scheduled Tudor to be assigned

an unpopulated study hall every afternoon during the 2019-2020 school

year so that she could take an afternoon break. (Id. ¶¶ 24, 31, 39.) Tudor

disputes the fact that the study hall was unpopulated, noting that there

were occasionally students present, and, additionally, maintains that Keller

did not express to her that she was permitted to leave during the study hall

or that it was being provided as an accommodation. (Pl.’s SMF ¶¶ 24, 31,

39.) However, Tudor was able to take an afternoon break on “[m]ost days,”

leaving the building in the afternoon on ninety-one days. (Def.’s SMF ¶¶

44-47.) After the transition to remote instruction, Tudor “was able to take

breaks when she needed them.” (Id. ¶ 55.)

      With respect to the 2019-2020 school year, Tudor “admit[ed] that . . .

she could perform the essential functions of her job even though she was

not granted her accommodation request,” albeit “under great duress and

harm.” (Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 14 at 3-4; see id., Attach. 13 at 3; see id.,

Attach. 4 at 126-28; Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 84, 86.) “No one at the [school d]istrict

expressed any concerns to [Tudor] about her job performance during the

2019-2020 school year,” Tudor “was not counseled or disciplined,” and she

“did not lose any compensation or benefits.” (Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 88, 92-94.)

      Tudor filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission (EEOC) in March 2020, regarding the District’s alleged failure

to accommodate her during the 2019-2020 school year. (Id. ¶¶ 69-70.)

Tudor thereafter received a right to sue notice in connection with that

EEOC charge. (Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 8.)

      The standard of review under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 is well settled and

will not be repeated here. For a full discussion of the governing standard,

the court refers the parties to its prior decision in Wagner v. Swarts, 827 F.

Supp. 2d 85, 92 (N.D.N.Y. 2011), aff’d sub nom. Wagner v. Sprague, 489

F. App’x 500 (2d Cir. 2012).

      The District argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because

                                       4
 Case 1:20-cv-01338-GLS-CFH Document 35 Filed 03/21/23 Page 5 of 8




Tudor has not established that she is considered disabled under the ADA.

(Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 2 at 12-14.) In the alternative, the District contends

that, while it did not provide Tudor with the exact accommodation she

requested, it provided a reasonable alternative accommodation. (Id. at 14-

21.) Further the District maintains that it is entitled to summary judgment

because Tudor “admits that she was able to perform her essential job

duties during the 2019-2020 school year with the accommodations that

were provided to her by the District, albeit under ‘great duress and harm’”

and faced no “adverse employment action as a result of any alleged failure

by the District to accommodate her disability.” (Id. at 16-19.)4

      Tudor argues that she has adequately established that she is

considered disabled under the ADA. (Dkt. No. 33 at 10-20.) Tudor further

contends that “Keller did not tell her that the afternoon study [hall] was

being provided to her as [alternative] accommodation” which “compelled


      4
         Additionally, the District maintains that, “[t]o the extent . . . [Tudor]
claims that the District violated the ADA by failing to engage in the ADA
interactive process,” there “is no independent cause of action for” such
action, (Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 2 at 19-20), which is correct. See Kugel v.
Queens Nassau Nursing Home Inc., 568 F. Supp. 3d 253, 262 (E.D.N.Y.
2021) (“Second Circuit case law is clear that failure to engage in a
good-faith interactive process under ADA . . . does not state an
independent cause of action.” (collecting cases)).

[her] to accommodate herself by leaving the building during her study hall

under threat of discipline.” (Id. at 19, 21.) Finally, Tudor maintains that

such a failure to accommodate her violated the ADA because her

proposed accommodation was reasonable and would have allowed her to

“perform the essential functions of [her] employment position.” (Id. at 21-

28.)

       An employer may be liable under the ADA where it fails to make

“reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of

an otherwise qualified individual with a disability.” 42 U.S.C.

§ 12112(b)(5)(A); see McBride v. BIC Consumer Prod. Mfg., 583 F.3d 92,

96 (2d Cir. 2009). To make a prima facie showing of an employer’s failure

to accommodate, a plaintiff must establish:

            “(1) the plaintiff is a person with a disability under the
            meaning of the statute in question; (2) an employer
            covered by the statute had notice of h[er] disability;
            (3) with reasonable accommodation, plaintiff could
            perform the essential functions of the job at issue;
            and (4) the employer has refused to make such
            accommodations.”

WL 598699, at *3 (2d Cir. Dec. 17, 2021) (quoting Natofsky v. City of New

York, 921 F.3d 337, 352 (2d Cir. 2019)).

      Here, assuming, without deciding, that Tudor is disabled under the

ADA, and that the scheduling arrangement in place regarding her

afternoon study hall constituted a denial of Tudor’s requested

accommodation, the District’s motion for summary judgment must still be

granted. The District points to uncontroverted evidence, including Tudor’s

own admissions, that, regardless of the alleged denial of her

accommodation, she was able to perform the essential functions of her job,

(Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 84, 86; see Dkt. No. 22, Attach. 14 ¶ 2; see also id., Attach.

13 at 3; id., Attach. 4 at 126-28), and, therefore, no fact finder could

determine she has established the third element of her failure to

accommodate claim, see Anderson v. Nat’l Grid, PLC, 93 F. Supp. 3d 120,

139 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (granting summary judgment, where “there [wa]s

insufficient evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that

plaintiff needed a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential

functions of his job,” because “plaintiff admitted that he met all of his job

performance goals”); see also Harvin v. Manhattan and Bronx Surface

Transit. Operating Auth., No. 14-CV-5125, 2018 WL 1603872, at *5,

(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2018) (collecting cases). Accordingly, the District’s

motion for summary judgment must be granted.

      Accordingly, it is hereby

      ORDERED that the District’s motion for summary judgment (Dkt.

No. 22) is GRANTED; and it is further

      ORDERED that the amended complaint (Dkt. No. 9) is DISMISSED;

and it is further

      ORDERED that the Clerk close this case; and it is further

      ORDERED that the Clerk provide a copy of this Summary Order to

the parties.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
