                                  13          In 2016, Congress amended the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to enact the first

                                  14   national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standards. See 7 U.S.C. § 1639 (the disclosure

                                  15   statute). The purpose of the disclosure statute is to establish uniformity in the way that

                                  16   bioengineered food is labeled and described to consumers. Plaintiffs are retail stores that sell

                                  17   natural and organic food products, and organizations engaged in food safety advocacy.

                                  18   Defendants are the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the USDA Secretary, and

                                  19   the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which is a USDA agency

                                  20   responsible for the marketing of agricultural commodities, among other programs.

                                  21          Plaintiffs filed a 115-page amended complaint that alleges a number of challenges to the

                                  22   disclosure statute and implementing regulations promulgated by the USDA. Dkt. No. 19. In

                                  23   pertinent part, plaintiffs challenge under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (APA),

                                  24   regulations that: (1) permit a text message disclosure option as an alternative to an electronic or

                                  25   digital link disclosure; (2) require disclosures to use the word “bioengineered”; and (3) exclude

                                  26   highly refined foods that do not contain detectable amounts of modified genetic material.

                                  27   Plaintiffs also say that the word-use regulations restrict their speech in violation of the First and

                                  28   Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and that a provision in the disclosure statute

                                   1   preempting state labeling laws for genetically engineered (GE) seeds violates the Tenth

                                   2   Amendment.

                                   3             Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, Dkt. No. 54, which the government

                                   4   opposed, Dkt. No. 56. The Court granted applications to intervene by the United States Beet

                                   5   Sugar Association, the American Sugarbeet Growers Association, and the American Farm Bureau

                                   6   Federation, see Dkt. Nos. 29, 46, and intervenors filed a consolidated opposition to plaintiffs’

                                   7   summary judgment motion. Dkt. No. 57.

                                   8             Summary judgment is granted in favor of plaintiffs under the APA for the text message

                                  11   I.        THE DISCLOSURE STATUTE
                                  12             The salient facts are undisputed. In 2016, in response to the adoption of state laws
Northern District of California
 United States District Court




                                  13   regulating the labeling of GE and genetically modified (GM or GMO) food and seeds, Congress

                                  14   amended the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to establish the first-ever national standard of

                                  15   consumer disclosures for bioengineered foods. AR248811.1 Congress declared that the purpose

                                  16   of the disclosure statute was “to preempt state and local actions that mandate labeling of whether a

                                  17   food or seed is genetically engineered, and establish a mandatory uniform national disclosure

                                  18   standard for human food that is or may be bioengineered.” Id.

                                  19             As used in the disclosure statute, “bioengineering” with respect to a food means a food

                                  20   “(A) that contains genetic material that has been modified through in vitro recombinant

                                  21   deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques; and (B) for which the modification could not otherwise

                                  22   be obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature.” 7 U.S.C. § 1639(1). “Food” takes

                                  23   the definition in 21 U.S.C. § 321(f) of “(1) articles used for food or drink for man or other animals,

                                  24   (2) chewing gum, and (3) articles used for components of any such article.” See 7 U.S.C.

                                  25   § 1639(2). A “food derived from an animal” may not “be considered a bioengineered food solely

                                  26   because the animal consumed feed” containing bioengineered substances. Id. § 1639b(b)(2)(A).

                                   1   Congress did not specify a threshold of “the amounts of a bioengineered substance” in a food to

                                   2   trigger a bioengineering classification. Id. § 1639b(b)(2)(B).

                                   3          Congress directed the USDA to implement regulations “with respect to any bioengineered

                                   4   food and any food that may be bioengineered,” and to “establish such requirements and

                                   5   procedures as the [USDA] determines necessary to carry out the standard.” Id. § 1639b(a). The

                                   6   statute mandates that “[a] food may bear a disclosure that the food is bioengineered only in

                                   7   accordance with regulations promulgated by the [USDA] in accordance with this subchapter.” Id.

                                   8   § 1639b(b)(1).

                                   9          Congress issued a number of specific directives to the USDA for the regulations. Among

                                  10   others, Congress required that a bioengineering disclosure on labels for consumers take the form

                                  11   of “a text, symbol, or electronic or digital link,” with the “disclosure option to be selected by the

                                  12   food manufacturer.” Id. § 1639b(b)(2)(D). It required that the electronic or digital link be

                                  13   accompanied by “on-package language” indicating that the link provides access to food

                                  14   information, along with “a telephone number that provides access to the bioengineering

                                  15   disclosure.” Id. § 1639b(d)(1), (4).

                                  16          The disclosure statute also directed the USDA to “conduct a study to identify potential

                                  17   technological challenges that may impact whether consumers would have access to the

                                  18   bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods.” Id. § 1639b(c)(1). If

                                  19   the study determined “that consumers, while shopping, would not have sufficient access to the

                                  20   bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods,” the USDA was to

                                  21   “provide additional and comparable options to access the bioengineering disclosure.” Id.

                                  22   § 1639b(c)(4).

                                  23          In addition to the consumer disclosure elements, the statute contains a section that

                                  24   preempts state labeling laws for GE food and seeds. This section declares that “[n]o State or a

                                  25   political subdivision of a State may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue

                                  26   in effect as to any food or seed in interstate commerce any requirement relating to the labeling of

                                  27   whether a food (including food served in a restaurant or similar establishment) or seed is

                                  28   genetically engineered (which shall include such other similar terms as determined by the

                                   1   [USDA]) or was developed or produced using genetic engineering, including any requirement for

                                   2   claims that a food or seed is or contains an ingredient that was developed or produced using

                                   3   genetic engineering.” Id. § 1639i(b). Plaintiffs acknowledged in a reply brief that the preemption

                                   4   provision properly regulates private actors with respect to food labeling, but they challenge

                                   5   preemption with respect to seed labeling. Dkt. No. 58 at 18-19.

                                   6   II.       THE DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS
                                   7             The USDA delegated to AMS the task of formulating regulations responsive to Congress’s

                                   8   directives. 83 Fed. Reg. at 65814. To that end, AMS posted 30 questions for public comment on

                                   9   its website in June 2017, and received over 112,000 responses. AR282-90; 83 Fed. Reg. at 19860.

                                  10   In May 2018, AMS published a notice of proposed rulemaking, and received approximately

                                  11   14,000 comments. 83 Fed. Reg. at 19860, 65814. AMS published the final regulations in

                                  12   December 2018, with a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2022. Id. at 65814; 7 C.F.R.

                                  13   § 66.1.

                                  14             The regulations apply to a “regulated entity,” which is defined as “the food manufacturer,

                                  15   importer, or retailer that is responsible for making bioengineered food disclosures under

                                  16   § 66.100(a).” 7 C.F.R. § 66.1. A manufacturer or importer is responsible for disclosures for foods

                                  17   that are “packaged prior to receipt by a retailer.” Id. § 66.100(a)(1). A retailer is responsible for

                                  18   foods the retailer packages itself, or sells in bulk. Id. § 66.100(a)(2). The retailer plaintiffs,

                                  19   Natural Grocers, Good Earth Natural Foods, and Puget Consumers Co-op, are regulated entities to

                                  20   the extent they package or sell food in bulk in their stores. See id.

                                  21             A.     The Electronic Disclosure Study
                                  22             AMS hired Deloitte Consulting to conduct the study on the accessibility of the electronic

                                  23   disclosure mandated by Section 1639b(c)(1) of the statute. See AR250043-118. The study found

                                  24   that “key technological challenges,” including a lack of technical knowledge and a lack of

                                  25   infrastructure, “prevented nearly all participants from obtaining the information through electronic

                                  26   or digital disclosure methods.” AR250046. It also found that the telephone numbers

                                  27   accompanying the electronic disclosure “do not provide a viable means of accessing the

                                  28   bioengineering disclosure.” AR250091. The study recommended “on-package identification,”
                                                                                           4

                                   1   such as “a landline-enabled bioengineering disclosure” with “24-hour disclosure information via

                                   2   an automated recording,” and “a text message alternative for consumers who have access to a

                                   3   mobile phone.” AR250111.

                                   4          Based on the study, AMS concluded that “consumers would not have sufficient access to

                                   5   the bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital means under ordinary shopping

                                   6   conditions at this time.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 65828. To improve consumer access to the

                                   7   bioengineering information, and to satisfy Congress’s directive to “provide additional and

                                   8   comparable options to access the bioengineering disclosure,” 7 U.S.C. § 1639b(c)(4), AMS

                                   9   created a fourth disclosure option of text messaging separate from the electronic disclosure

                                  10   method. 83 Fed. Reg. at 65828-29; 7 C.F.R. §§ 66.100(b)(4), 66.108.

                                  11          The final regulations provide that regulated entities can comply with the disclosure

                                  12   requirement by adding one of the following to a food label: (i) the statement “Bioengineered

                                  13   food” or “Contains a bioengineered food ingredient” (the text disclosure); (ii) a symbol that says

                                  14   “bioengineered” (the symbol disclosure); (iii) an electronic or digital disclosure link and

                                  15   accompanying text (the electronic disclosure); or (iv) text message instructions (the text message

                                  16   disclosure). Id. §§ 66.100(b)(1)-(4), 66.102, 66.104, 66.106, 66.108. 2

                                  17          For the electronic disclosure, a food label must have an electronic or digital link printed on

                                  18   the label, and the link must be accompanied by the statement “Scan here for more food

                                  19   information” and “Call [1-000-000-0000] for more food information.” Id. § 66.106. The link

                                  20   must connect directly to a product information page that includes the text disclosure or the symbol

                                  21   disclosure, and the page must exclude marketing and promotional information. Id. § 66.106(b).

                                  22          For the text message disclosure, a food label must say “Text [command word] to [number]

                                  23   for bioengineered food information.” Id. § 66.108(a). The number must send “an immediate

                                  24   response to the consumer’s mobile device” with the text disclosure or the symbol disclosure, and

                                  25   the response must not contain any marketing or promotional information. Id. § 66.108(a)-(c).

                                   1          B.      Mandatory Disclosure Terminology

                                   2          In the notice of proposed rulemaking, AMS proposed the use of the term “bioengineered”

                                   3   in all disclosures because the “statutory term, ‘bioengineering,’ adequately describes food

                                   4   products of the technology that Congress intended to be within the scope of the [regulations].” 83

                                   5   Fed. Reg. at 19871. The statute itself did not require the use of any particular words.

                                   6          A number of commenters objected to this proposal, and said the disclosure language

                                   7   should include GE or GMO because those terms are better understood by consumers. See id. at

                                   8   65851-52. Some commenters suggested that disclosures should include “may be bioengineered,”

                                   9   but others said that would be confusing. Id. at 65827, 65852.

                                  10          After reviewing the comments, AMS decided to require “bioengineered” in all disclosures.

                                  11   Id. at 65827, 65852-53; 7 C.F.R. §§ 66.100-66.108. The agency declined to use “may be

                                  12   bioengineered” as vague and likely to be confusing. 83 Fed. Reg. at 65827, 65852. AMS was a

                                  13   bit more ambivalent about GE or GMO, but “ultimately determined that bioengineering and

                                  14   bioengineered food accurately reflected the scope of disclosure and the products and potential

                                  15   technology at issue.” Id. at 65837. In the view of AMS, GE or GMO might “create

                                  16   inconsistencies with the preemption provisions or muddy the scope of disclosure,” and limiting

                                  17   mandatory disclosure language to bioengineered would provide “disclosure consistency” and

                                  18   minimize “marketplace confusion.” Id. at 65837, 65851.

                                  19          AMS took some pains to emphasize that the mandatory disclosure language is intended to

                                  20   be a floor, not a ceiling. As minimum requirements, the text disclosure must say “Bioengineered

                                  21   food” or “Contains a bioengineered food ingredient,” and the symbol disclosure must use the word

                                  22   “BIOENGINEERED.” 7 C.F.R. §§ 66.102(a), 66.104(a). Even so, as detailed in the ensuing First

                                  23   and Fifth Amendment discussion, regulated entities are perfectly free to make additional

                                  24   statements about bioengineered foods so long as they are consistent with federal laws generally.

                                  25   83 Fed. Reg. at 65852; 7 C.F.R. § 66.118; see also Dkt. No. 56 at 28 (government brief

                                   1          C.      Regulatory Definition of “Bioengineering” and Highly Refined Foods

                                   2          In the notice of proposed rulemaking, AMS called for comments on what bioengineered

                                   3   should mean in light of the statutory definition of “bioengineering.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 19862-63; see

                                   4   also 7 U.S.C. § 1639(1). AMS presented two “positions” as options. Position 1 defined

                                   5   “bioengineering” to exclude highly refined food products that might have used genetically

                                   6   modified ingredients, but do not have detectable levels of modified genetic material in the final

                                   7   product sold to consumers. 83 Fed. Reg. at 19862-63. Such ingredients include sugar derived

                                   8   from genetically modified sugar cane and sugar beets, corn starch and corn syrup derived from

                                   9   genetically modified corn, and soybean oil derived from genetically modified soybeans. Id.

                                  10   Position 2 defined bioengineering to include all foods produced using bioengineering technology

                                  11   or genetically modified ingredients, including highly refined products that do not have detectable

                                  12   modified genetic material. Id. at 19863.

                                  13          The position proposals elicited divided comments. Id. at 65833-37. Supporters of Position

                                  14   2 argued that consumers are more concerned about the use of bioengineered crops than whether

                                  15   the products derived from those crops contain detectable modified genetic material. Id. at 65834-

                                  16   35. Proponents of Position 1 stated that scientific studies have demonstrated an absence of

                                  17   modified genetic material in highly refined foods as the result of processing, and expressed

                                  18   concern that mandating disclosure for all refined products would disparage biotechnology and

                                  19   impose undue compliance costs on regulated entities. Id. at 65833, 65836. Critics of Position 1

                                  20   took issue with the detectability point and noted that testing methods would likely improve over

                                  21   time to reveal the presence of previously undetectable modified genetic material. Id. at 65834.

                                  22   The concern is that a detection standard would allow refined foods containing modified genetic

                                  23   material to be sold unwittingly to consumers today.

                                  24          In the final regulations, AMS adopted a modified version of Position 1. It defined

                                  25   bioengineering to exclude foods with undetectable modified genetic material. Id. at 65816-17;

                                  26   7 C.F.R. § 66.1. AMS also created something of a safety net by adopting a “List of Bioengineered

                                  27   Foods,” which are crops and food ingredients presumed to be bioengineered. 7 C.F.R. § 66.6; 83

                                  28   Fed. Reg. at 65826. The current list comprises “[a]lfalfa, apple (ArcticTM varieties), canola, corn,

                                   1   cotton, eggplant (BARI Bt Begun varieties), papaya (ringspot virus-resistant varieties), pineapple

                                   2   (pink flesh varieties), potato, salmon (AquAdvantage®), soybean, squash (summer), and

                                   3   sugarbeet.” 7 C.F.R. § 66.6. AMS committed to updating the list as warranted on an annual basis.

                                   4   Id. § 66.7. A highly refined food produced with a listed item as an ingredient is presumed to

                                   5   require disclosure, and would be exempted only if the regulated entity proved that the product is

                                   6   not bioengineered. 83 Fed. Reg. at 65818-19, 65826; 7 C.F.R. §§ 66.5, 66.6, 66.9; see also Dkt.

                                   7   No. 56 at 5 (“A crop or food included on the List or a food made from or with an item on the List

                                   8   requires disclosure unless a regulated entity has records demonstrating that its food product is not

                                   9   bioengineered (e.g. is organic or does not contain detectable modified genetic material).”). In

                                  10   sum, AMS determined that highly refined foods would not be subject to the disclosure statute and

                                  11   regulations unless: (1) they had detectable amounts of modified genetic material; or (2) they

                                  12   included ingredients from the presumed bioengineered list and the regulated entity did not prove

 United States District Court




                                  13   that the food was not bioengineered.

                                  14            AMS concluded that this approach would likely be overinclusive. 83 Fed. Reg. at 65826

                                  15   (“While we acknowledge that this framework may result in regulated entities placing a BE

                                  16   disclosure on a food that they do not know with certainty is bioengineered, we believe that it is

                                  17   appropriate to err on the side of disclosure to provide consumers with the fullest information about

                                  18   food that could be bioengineered.”). AMS also concluded that many highly refined foods may not

                                  19   require a bioengineering disclosure even with the use of a listed ingredient because “the refining

                                  20   process removes the genetic material so that it can no longer be detected. If the genetic material is

                                  21   not detected, then it is not possible to conclude that the food product or ingredient contains

                                  22   modified genetic material.” Id. at 65834.

                                  23   III.     PLAINTIFFS’ LAWSUIT
                                  24            Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit approximately 18 months after AMS published the final

                                  25   regulations. Dkt. No. 1. The amended complaint alleges that the regulations concerning the text

                                  26   message disclosure, mandatory disclosure terminology, and the definition of bioengineering, are

                                  27   not in accordance with law and are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure

                                  28   Act. Dkt. No. 19 ¶¶ 133-42, 205-10, 271-79. Plaintiffs also say that the disclosure statute and the
                                                                                         8

                                   1   regulations violate the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution by limiting their freedom to

                                   2   use words other than “bioengineered” in communications with consumers. Id. ¶¶ 317-33, 392-

                                   3   401. To be clear, plaintiffs do not bring a constitutional challenge to the mandatory use of specific

                                   4   words in the standardized disclosures. They object only that the regulations, in their view, do not

                                   5   let them say more. Plaintiffs also contend that the preemption of state labeling laws for GE seeds

                                   6   violates the Tenth Amendment. Id. ¶¶ 361-67.

                                   8   IV.     LEGAL STANDARDS
                                   9           The standard of review for claims brought under the APA is well established. See, e.g.,

                                  14   relied on factors Congress did not intend it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important

                                   1          These alleged injuries are concrete, fairly traceable to the agency’s conduct, and

                                  10   advocacy groups, are not regulated entities, and suggest that a right to receive information is

                                  11   impaired by the chilling effect on regulated entities. See Dkt. No. 54 at 23 n.40 (“Customers of

                                   1   (9th Cir. 2010). The “inquiry into injury-in-fact does not turn on the strength of plaintiffs’

                                   2   concerns about a law, but rather on the credibility of the threat that the challenged law will be

                                   5          Plaintiffs’ main speech challenge goes to the use of terms such as GE, GMO, and the like.

                                   9   vague because the statute states that “similar terms” may be incorporated in the definition of

                                  10   bioengineering, but the regulations prohibit them. Id. at 27. The retail store plaintiffs are said to

                                  11   have suffered economic and reputational injuries as a result because they terminated plans to label

                                  12   foods as GE or GMO or removed such labels from their stores out of fear that the labels violated

                                  13   the disclosure statute and the regulations. See Dkt. No. 54-1 ¶¶ 20-21, 24, 27; Dkt. No. 54-7 ¶¶ 4,

                                  14   17-18; Dkt. No. 54-9 ¶¶ 7, 14-15.

                                  15          These points are not well taken. To start, plaintiffs misconstrue the plain language of the

                                  16   statute and the regulations. Nothing in either text forbids the plaintiffs from using GE, GMO, or

                                  17   any other words they want in their communications with consumers. The only requirement is that

                                  18   all disclosures must use the word “bioengineered.” 7 C.F.R. §§ 66.102, 66.104. This is the whole

                                  19   purpose of the disclosure statute: the use of standardized language to ensure that consumers get

                                  20   the same baseline information about bioengineered food irrespective of where they buy it, or from

                                  21   whom. After that, plaintiffs are perfectly free to speak their minds in any manner they choose.

                                  22   The regulations spelled this out by stating that “nothing in the final rule prohibits regulated entities

                                  23   from providing additional statements or other claims regarding bioengineered foods and

                                  24   bioengineered food ingredients, so long as such statements are consistent with all other applicable

                                  25   laws and regulations.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 65852; see also 7 C.F.R. § 66.118. The government has

                                  26   expressly affirmed that,“[a]s long as regulated entities use those standard terms, they are permitted

                                  27   to ‘mak[e] other claims regarding bioengineered foods,’ including Plaintiffs’ preferred terms

                                  28   ‘produced with genetic engineering,’ ‘genetically engineered,’ or ‘GMO’ on their disclosures,” so

                                   1   long as the claims are consistent with federal law. See Dkt. No. 56 at 28 (quoting 7 C.F.R.

                                   2   § 66.118).

                                   3          Plaintiffs have not demonstrated otherwise. They say that the government’s statement is

                                   4   nothing more than a “convenient, 11th hour” litigation position, but this fails to account for the

                                   5   plain language of the regulations to the same effect. See Dkt. No. 58 at 17. Plaintiffs also did not

                                   6   proffer any evidence indicating that “they have ever been threatened with prosecution, that a

                                   7   prosecution is likely, or even that a prosecution is remotely possible.” Lopez, 630 F.3d at 787

                                   8   (quoting Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 42 (1972)). “Mere allegations” of a “subjective chill,”

                                   9   which is all plaintiffs have tendered here, are not a substitute for establishing a likelihood of an

                                  10   injury in fact. Id. (internal quotations omitted).

                                  11          Overall, the record does not establish that plaintiffs face a well-founded fear of

                                  12   enforcement for using GE, GMO, or any other words above and beyond the mandatory disclosure

                                  13   terminology. Consequently, they do not have standing to challenge the statute or regulations on

                                  14   First or Fifth Amendment grounds. See Barke, 25 F.4th at 718-19.

                                  15          The same goes for plaintiffs’ ancillary speech challenges. They object to a provision that

                                  16   prohibits labeling meat or dairy products as bioengineered solely because the products were

                                  17   derived from livestock fed GE feed. See 7 U.S.C. § 1639b(b)(2)(A); 7 C.F.R. § 66.5(d)); see also

                                  18   Dkt. No. 54 at 24-25. Plaintiffs again have not shown a well-founded fear of enforcement because

                                  19   they did not demonstrate concrete plans to use a “bioengineered” label on any meat or dairy

                                  20   products. See Dkt. No. 54-1 ¶¶ 24, 26; Dkt. No. 54-7 ¶ 15; Dkt. No. 54-9 ¶ 13. This devitalizes

                                  21   their standing to sue. See Lopez, 630 F.3d at 787 (“Because the Constitution requires something

                                  22   more than hypothetical intent to violate the law, plaintiffs must articulate a concrete plan to violate

                                  23   the law in question by giving details about their future speech such as when, to whom, where, or

                                  24   under what circumstances.”) (internal quotations omitted).

                                  25          Plaintiffs also object that the regulations prohibit use of the phrase “may be

                                  26   bioengineered.” See 83 Fed. Reg. at 65827 (“The ‘may be bioengineered’ disclosure cannot be

                                  27   used.”); see also Dkt. No. 54 at 24-25. Some of the plaintiffs said that they might like to use “may

                                  28   be bioengineered” on labels in their stores, see Dkt. No. 54-1 ¶¶ 22, 27; Dkt. No. 54-7 ¶ 16, but

                                   1   such “some day intentions” are not the stuff of constitutional standing. Lopez, 630 F. 3d at 787-88

                                   2   (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiff Puget Consumers Co-op said that it had devoted substantial

                                   3   effort to an in-store labeling plan for GE/GMO foods that included “may be bioengineered”

                                   4   language, see Dkt. No. 54-9 ¶¶ 12-13, 19, but undercut that claim substantially by opining that

                                   5   “bioengineered” is deceptive and that it would not use the phrase with customers. Id. ¶ 15

                                   6   (“[R]ather than using the labeling plan PCC worked on for six years, with the clearly recognized

                                   7   and widely accepted and understood terms of ‘GE’ or ‘GMO’ for foods with identified genetically

                                   8   engineered ingredients, the Disclosure Standard forces PCC to use the unknown terminology,

                                   9   ‘bioengineered’ … ‘GE’ and ‘GMO’ are the terms that our members know, so using the label,

                                  10   ‘bioengineered,’ will simply not pass the information to our members in a useful, clearly

                                  11   understandable way.”). This does not demonstrate a “concrete intent to violate the challenged

                                  12   law” and consequently does not establish a credible threat of enforcement. Lopez, 630 F.3d at

                                   5   gives Congress’s words their ordinary and every day meaning, and may consult dictionary

                                  13          “When construing a statute, a virtuoso feat of analysis is neither required nor particularly

                                  14   useful.” Michigan v. DeVos, 481 F. Supp. 3d 984, 991 (N.D. Cal. 2020). The ultimate goal of

                                  15   statutory construction is to effectuate Congress’s intent in enacting the statute. “In every case, ‘it

                                  16   is the intent of Congress that is the ultimate touchstone.’” Barr, 941 F.3d at 940 (quoting Arizona

                                  18   The Court bears “the conventional judicial duty to give faithful meaning to the language Congress

                                  22          The language Congress used in Section 1639b(c) of the disclosure statute is

                                  23   straightforward. It directed the USDA to conduct a study “to identify potential technological

                                  24   challenges that may impact whether consumers would have access to the bioengineering

                                  25   disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods.” 7 U.S.C. § 1639b(c)(1). No feat of

                                  26   analysis is necessary to conclude that Congress was especially concerned about whether

                                  27   consumers would be able to access bioengineering information through the electronic disclosure.

                                  28   The same subsection of the disclosure statute also required USDA to “provide additional and
                                                                                         16

                                   2   while shopping, would not have sufficient access to the bioengineering disclosure through

                                   3   electronic or digital disclosure methods.” Id. § 1639b(c)(4). In mandating a study on the

                                   4   accessibility of the electronic disclosure, and directing the USDA to act only if the electronic

                                   5   disclosure was determined to be inaccessible, Congress clearly intended for the USDA to provide

                                   6   “additional and comparable options” to improve the accessibility of the electronic disclosure

                                   7   method.

                                   8          AMS’s decision to provide a separate text message disclosure option did nothing to fix the

                                   9   problem of inaccessible electronic disclosures. It merely provided a fourth disclosure option that

                                  10   regulated entities can select instead of the electronic disclosure method. See 7 C.F.R. § 66.100(b)

                                  13   options). The result is that the standalone electronic disclosure suffices under the regulations,

                                  14   even though USDA “determined that consumers would not have sufficient access to the

                                  15   bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital means under ordinary shopping conditions

                                  16   at this time.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 65828.

                                  17          The government says AMS acted appropriately because it “adopted the study’s

                                  18   recommendation to provide food manufacturers with an additional option of disclosing the

                                  19   bioengineering information via text message, a method that is comparable to the electronic or

                                  20   digital link method.” Dkt. No. 56 at 18. It says the words “additional and comparable options”

                                  21   only obligated AMS to provide “similar” disclosure options rather than improvements on the

                                  22   electronic disclosure. Id. These arguments are not consonant with the rest of Section 1639b(c),

                                  23   which expressly addresses whether consumers can access the electronic disclosure at all.

                                  24   Congress mandated a study on “whether consumers would have access to the bioengineering

                                  25   disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods” precisely to ensure that those methods

                                  26   were accessible and would achieve the goal of disclosure. See 7 U.S.C. § 1639b(c)(1).

                                  27          The Deloitte Consulting study also undercuts the government’s arguments. The study

                                  28   determined that access problems abounded. Among other findings, it concluded that “key
                                                                                        17

                                   1   technological challenges” prevented “nearly all participants” from accessing bioengineering

                                   2   information electronically. AR250046. The study found that “[t]houghtful action can improve

                                   3   access for consumers facing technological challenges,” and identified specific “[o]ffline options”

                                   4   that could “provide greater access for populations who lack smartphones or broadband.”

                                   5   AR250110-11. It recommended that, “[a]s the Law already requires that the electronic disclosure

                                   6   is accompanied by a telephone number,” the number could call into an automated recording that

                                   7   would provide consumers with “24-hour disclosure information.” AR250111. It also

                                   8   recommended that “packages could include a text message alternative for consumers who have

                                   9   access to a mobile phone.” Id. AMS partly adopted this recommendation by requiring that the

                                  10   telephone number that accompanies the electronic disclosure must provide access to the

                                  11   bioengineered food disclosure “regardless of the time of day.” See 7 C.F.R. § 66.106(a)(2). But

                                  12   the agency failed to take the next step of adding “additional and comparable options,” like the
Northern District of California
 United States District Court




                                  13   alternative text message instructions, to the electronic disclosure. See 7 U.S.C. § 1639b(c)(4).

                                  14          The government tries to defend this inaction by suggesting that adding more requirements

                                  15   to the electronic disclosure “would narrow rather than expand the disclosure options for food

                                  16   manufactures” and “rewrite the [disclosure statute] to require AMS to effectively eliminate the

                                  17   electronic or digital link option mandated by Congress, rather than providing an additional and

                                  18   comparable option for labeling.” Dkt. No. 56 at 19 (emphasis in original). Not so. The statute

                                  19   already requires that the electronic disclosure be accompanied by a telephone number and by “on-

                                  20   package language” indicating that the link and the telephone number will provide access to “more

                                  21   food information.” 7 U.S.C. §§ 1639b(d)(1), (4). In addition, nothing in the statute permitted

                                  22   AMS to expand the disclosure options for manufacturers beyond the “text, symbol, or electronic

                                  23   or digital link” choices. Id. § 1639b(b)(2)(D). It may be that many retailers and manufacturers

                                  24   supported the standalone text message disclosure option, as the government notes. Dkt. No. 56 at

                                  25   21; see also 83 Fed. Reg. at 65855-56; AR183199; AR183707; AR233404-05. But that did not

                                  26   relieve AMS of the obligation to comply with Congress’s express direction to “provide additional

                                  27   and comparable options to access the bioengineering disclosure.” 7 U.S.C. § 1639b(c)(4).

                                   1          The government also suggests that the agency’s interpretation of Section 1639b(c)(4) is

                                   2   entitled to deference. Dkt. No. 56 at 20-22. “[C]ourts ‘often apply the two-step framework

                                   3   announced in’” Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), “to

                                   4   determine the validity of an agency’s interpretation of a statute.” DeVos, 481 F. Supp. 3d at 993

                                   5   (quoting King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 485 (2015)). “This approach is premised on the theory

                                   6   that a statute’s ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in

                                   7   the statutory gaps.” King, 576 U.S. at 485 (internal quotations omitted). When the statute is

                                   8   ambiguous, courts will defer to the agency’s interpretation. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.

                                   9          The problem for the government is that it cannot make it past step one, which asks whether

                                  10   the statute is ambiguous. When Congress has spoken clearly, as it did in Section 1639b(c)(4) of

                                  11   the disclosure statute, “that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give

                                  12   effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” Corrigan, 12 F.4th at 907 (internal

                                  13   quotations omitted). “An executive agency . . . has no authority to rewrite Congress’s plain and

                                  14   unambiguous commands under the guise of interpretation, and no deference is owed when an

                                  15   agency acts in contravention of a statute.” DeVos, 481 F. Supp. 3d at 993 (citing Chevron, 467

                                  16   U.S. at 842-43).

                                  17          Consequently, plaintiffs have carried their burden of showing that AMS’s decision to

                                  18   implement a standalone text message disclosure option was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of

                                  19   discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).

                                  20          For the question of a remedy, the Court will set aside an action “found to be arbitrary,

                                  21   capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” Id. Remand with

                                  22   vacatur is the typical remedy in these circumstances, unless the government establishes why

                                  23   another remedy, such as remand without vacatur, is a better result. All. for the Wild Rockies v.

                                  25   appropriate “depends on how serious the agency’s errors are and the disruptive consequences of an

                                   1          The text message disclosure decision was a significant error, but the government urges a

                                   2   remand without vacatur so that the status quo is maintained while AMS revisits the issue. Dkt.

                                   3   No. 56 at 39-40. It says that vacatur would disrupt consumer access to bioengineering disclosures

                                   4   and exacerbate the very concerns implicated by the agency’s error. Id. It also says that vacatur

                                   5   would disrupt the food industry, which was required to comply with the regulations as of January

                                   6   1, 2022. Id.; 83 Fed. Reg. at 65814.

                                   7          These are legitimate and persuasive concerns, and plaintiffs have not demonstrated

                                   8   otherwise. Consequently, Sections 66.106 and 66.108 of the regulations are remanded without

                                   9   vacatur to AMS for further consideration in a manner consistent with this order.

                                  11          Although plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the regulations for the mandatory disclosure

                                  12   terminology under the First and Fifth Amendments, they may challenge the regulations under the
Northern District of California
 United States District Court




                                  13   APA. Plaintiffs say that mandating the use of “bioengineered” in disclosures was contrary to the

                                  14   statutory directive to define “any similar term,” which plaintiffs construe as requiring terms other

                                  15   than just “bioengineered.” See Dkt. No. 54 at 15-16; 7 U.S.C. § 1639(1). Plaintiffs also say that

                                  16   the decision was arbitrary and capricious because the term bioengineered is inconsistent with the

                                  17   agency’s past use of terms like GE and GMO, and is potentially misleading to consumers. See

                                  18   Dkt. No. 54 at 16-18.

                                  19          None of these contentions is tenable. The statute authorized the USDA to supplement the

                                  20   definition of bioengineering with “any similar term, as determined by the [USDA].” 7 U.S.C.

                                  21   § 1639(1). This is wholly distinct from the disclosure requirements in Section 1639b. Nothing in

                                  22   either section indicates that Congress intended to require that “any similar term” be part of the

                                  23   mandatory disclosure language, and the Court will not strain to find such a hidden meaning when

                                  24   Congress could easily have conveyed such a clear directive. See Corrigan, 12 F.4th at 910.

                                  25          Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious arguments are equally unavailing. To start, the use of

                                  26   the term bioengineered cannot be characterized as a change in practice or policy because the

                                  27   disclosure statute and regulations are the first federal actions implementing standards for

                                  28   bioengineered food disclosures. It is true that some of the evidence before AMS indicated that
                                                                                        20

                                   1   consumers are more familiar with terms like GE and GMO than bioengineered. See, e.g.,

                                   2   AR17667; AR95879-80; AR178749-50. But AMS considered GE and GMO for use in the

                                   3   mandatory disclosure terminology, and ultimately determined that those terms could blur the

                                   4   scope of the regulations, and lead to inconsistent disclosures. 83 Fed. Reg. at 65837, 65851. The

                                   5   decision was reasoned and reasonable, and plaintiffs have not shown that it was arbitrary or

                                   6   capricious in any way.

                                   8            Plaintiffs’ other APA challenge concerns the agency’s definition of “bioengineering,”

                                   9   which excludes foods without “detectable” modified genetic material. 7 C.F.R. § 66.1. Plaintiffs

                                  10   say that this exemption is overbroad and does not regulate “any food that may be bioengineered,”

                                  11   as the disclosure statute requires. 7 U.S.C. § 1639b(a)(1) (emphasis added); see also Dkt. No. 54

                                  12   at 19-20. Plaintiffs also say that the agency’s decision to adopt an exclusion based on whether
Northern District of California

                                  13   modified genetic material is “detectable” was arbitrary and capricious because some studies have

                                  14   identified previously “undetectable” modified genetic material in highly refined foods. Dkt. No.

                                  15   54 at 21-22. Plaintiffs add that AMS arbitrarily and capriciously ignored evidence indicating that

                                  16   consumers are more concerned about whether foods are produced through bioengineering

                                  17   technology than whether modified genetic material is detectable in the final food product. Id. at

                                  18   22-23.

                                  19            These objections are not well taken. As discussed in Section II.C above, the regulations

                                  20   are much less exclusionary than plaintiffs suggest because AMS augmented the definition of

                                  21   bioengineering with the “List of Bioengineered Foods.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 65818-19, 65826;

                                  22   7 C.F.R. § 66.6. The list identifies a number of foods known to be bioengineered, and a refined

                                  23   food that contains an item from the list is presumed to be bioengineered and so require disclosure.

                                  24   83 Fed. Reg. at 65826, 65834. The food may escape the disclosure requirement only if the

                                  25   regulated entity provides records demonstrating that it is not bioengineered. Id.; 7 C.F.R. § 66.9.

                                  26   As AMS stated, the framework is designed to be overinclusive and “err on the side of disclosure to

                                  27   provide consumers with the fullest information about food that could be bioengineered.” 83 Fed.

                                   1          None of this was arbitrary and capricious. The statute expressly states that the agency

                                   2   “shall” promulgate regulations that “determine the amounts of a bioengineered substance that may

                                   3   be present in a food, as appropriate, in order for the food to be a bioengineered food.” 7 U.S.C.

                                   4   § 1639b(b)(2)(B). AMS did just that. See 7 C.F.R. § 66.9 (listing recordkeeping requirements to

                                   5   prove that modified genetic material is not detectable and “[s]tandards of performance for

                                   6   detectability testing”). It may be, as plaintiffs suggest, that future testing methods will be able to

                                   7   better detect modified genetic material in highly refined foods, see Dkt. No. 54 at 21-22, but that

                                   8   does not mean the regulations are defective because the current state of testing cannot exhaustively

                                   9   capture all foods that “may” contain bioengineered components. To the contrary, it would be

                                  10   wrong for an agency to require results impossible to obtain with existing technology.

                                  11          In addition, AMS did not ignore the likelihood of progress, and committed to updating the

                                  12   List of Bioengineered Foods on an annual basis. 83 Fed. Reg. at 65834 (“If the modified genetic

                                  13   material in [a] food ingredient becomes detectable under § 66.9 in the future, the food ingredient

                                  14   would be subject to BE disclosure.”); see also 7 C.F.R. § 66.7(a). AMS also concluded, based on

                                  15   multiple studies, that “for many refined food products and ingredients, the refining process

                                  16   removes the genetic material so that it can no longer be detected.” 83 Fed. Reg. at 65833-34.

                                  17   AMS ultimately determined that “the products of technology, rather than the technology itself,

                                  18   should determine whether a food meets the BE food definition and requires disclosure.” Id. at

                                  19   65834. Plaintiffs do not seriously dispute this observation.

                                  20          Overall, the record with respect to the mandatory disclosure language and highly refined

                                  21   foods does not show that AMS “relied on factors Congress did not intend it to consider, entirely

                                  22   failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, or offered an explanation that runs counter

                                  23   to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference

                                  24   in view or the product of agency expertise.” Defenders of Wildlife, 856 F.3d at 1257 (internal

                                  25   quotations omitted). Consequently, the agency’s actions were not in violation of the APA.

                                  26   VII.   THE TENTH AMENDMENT CLAIM
                                  27          Plaintiffs’ final challenge is to the preemption of state labeling requirements for GE seeds,

                                  28   see 7 U.S.C. § 1639i(b), which is said to violate the Tenth Amendment’s guarantee that “[t]he

                                   1   powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are

                                   2   reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” U.S. Const. amend. X; see also Dkt. No. 54

                                   3   at 28-29. For this claim, plaintiffs rely primarily on the anticommandeering doctrine developed in

                                   4   Tenth Amendment jurisprudence, particularly as discussed in Murphy v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic

                                   5   Ass’n, 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018). See Dkt. No. 54 at 28-29.

                                   6          “The anticommandeering doctrine may sound arcane, but it is simply the expression of a

                                   7   fundamental structural decision incorporated into the Constitution, i.e., the decision to withhold

                                   8   from Congress the power to issue orders directly to the States.” Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1475. The

                                   9   basic principle is that when “a federal interest is sufficiently strong to cause Congress to legislate,

                                  10   it must do so directly; it may not conscript state governments as its agents.” Id. at 1477 (quoting

                                  11   New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 178 (1992)). Put plainly, Congress cannot order a state

                                  12   to require or prohibit certain acts, or enact laws to those ends. Id. at 1476-77. A classic

                                  13   application of the doctrine is found in New York, 404 U.S. at 174-76, which struck down a federal

                                  14   statute that required states to enact laws for radioactive waste according to the instructions of

                                  15   Congress. As the Supreme Court stated, the Constitution “confers upon Congress the power to

                                  16   regulate individuals, not States.” Id. at 166.

                                  17          As New York indicates, the anticommandeering doctrine does not serve to protect the

                                  18   sovereignty of the states for the benefit of the states themselves. “To the contrary, the

                                  19   Constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of

                                  20   individuals” and their liberty. Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1477 (quoting New York, 404 U.S. at 181).

                                  21   This is accomplished by ensuring a “healthy balance” between state and federal power, which

                                  22   moderates the “risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.” Id. (quotation omitted).

                                  23          None of this is particularly germane to the GE seed labeling provision in Section 1639i(b)

                                  24   of the disclosure statute, and for good reason. The plain text of Section 1639i(b) demonstrates that

                                  25   it is not an attempt by Congress to order the states to do something. See 7 U.S.C. § 1639i(b).

                                  26   Rather, Section 1639i(b) is a typical federal preemption provision no different from similar

                                  27   provisions in many other federal statutes.

                                   1          Preemption is based on the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI cl. 2, and a federal

                                   2   statute may preempt state law without offending the Tenth Amendment. Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at

                                   3   1479. To preempt state law, a federal statute must (1) “represent the exercise of a power conferred

                                   4   on Congress by the Constitution,” and (2) “be best read as one that regulates private actors.” Id.;

                                   8   under the Commerce Clause and the regulations operated on private entities).

                                   9          For the first element, plaintiffs do not dispute that the disclosure statute as a whole,

                                  10   including Section 1639i(b), is a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.

                                  11   See Dkt. No. 58 at 18. They even go so far as to agree that Section 1639i(b) properly preempts

                                  12   state GE food labeling laws. See id.
Northern District of California
 United States District Court




                                  13          For the second element, plaintiffs overread the opening words of Section 1639i(b) that

                                  14   “[n]o State or a political subdivision of a State may” establish GE seed labeling requirements. 7

                                  15   U.S.C. § 1639i(b). The Supreme Court has expressly cautioned that “[t]his language might appear

                                  16   to operate directly on the States, but it is a mistake to be confused by the way in which a

                                  17   preemption provision is phrased.” Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1480. Murphy observed that the Airline

                                  18   Deregulation Act of 1978 contained nearly exactly the same formulation to preempt state

                                  19   regulation of airline rates, routes, and services. Id. (“[T]he Act provided that ‘no State or political

                                  20   subdivision thereof … shall enact or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision

                                  21   having the force and effect of law relating to rates, routes, or services of any [covered] air

                                  22   carrier.’”) (quoting Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 378 (1992)). Even so,

                                  23   the Court had no trouble concluding “it is clear that this provision operates just like any other

                                  24   federal law with preemptive effect” by conferring “on private entities (i.e., covered carriers) a

                                  25   federal right to engage in certain conduct subject only to certain (federal) constraints.” Id.

                                  26          So too, here. Section 1639i(b) of the disclosure statute confers on suppliers of GE seeds

                                  27   the right to be free of a patchwork of state laws. 7 U.S.C. § 1639i(b). This manifests Congress’s

                                  28   intent to set national standards and practices for disclosures about bioengineered foods. See
                                                                                         24

                                   1   AR248811 (“The purpose of the bill is to preempt state and local actions that mandate labeling of

                                   2   whether a food or seed is genetically engineered, and establish a mandatory uniform national

                                   3   disclosure standard for human food that is or may be bioengineered.”).

                                   4          Plaintiffs’ main response is that federal law currently does not have specific provisions for

                                   5   the labeling of GE seeds. See Dkt. No. 58 at 18-19. In effect, plaintiffs say that preemption is

                                   6   valid only if Congress has enacted federal laws in the area. But that is not an element of

                                   7   preemption stated in Murphy. In addition, the preemption clause in the Airline Deregulation Act

                                   8   was enacted precisely “[t]o ensure that the States would not undo federal deregulation with

                                   9   regulation of their own.” Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1480 (quoting Morales, 504 U.S. at 378). The

                                  10   petitioner in Morales made a similar objection that the Airline Deregulation Act did not have the

                                  11   “comprehensive” federal regulatory scheme of statutes with preemption clauses, such as ERISA,

                                  12   but the Supreme Court did not reject preemption on that ground. 504 U.S. at 384. Plaintiffs have
