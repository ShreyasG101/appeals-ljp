outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Lorna Orabona''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Orabona argued that the district court erred in finding her state law claims preempted by ERISA section 514(a), contending that her claims did not ''relate to'' the ERISA Severance Policy because reference to the plan would only be necessary to calculate a portion of her damages, not to determine liability.

  2. Orabona contended that her claims for breach of implied contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful termination, fraud and intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation were based on Santander''s pretextual and fraudulent termination of her employment to deprive her of severance benefits, and that these claims were not preempted by ERISA.

  3. Orabona argued that the calculation of damages under her state law claims would not require interpretation of the ERISA plan, and that reference to the plan for damages alone was insufficient to support ERISA preemption.

  4. Orabona asserted that her claims were not an attempt to recover ERISA plan benefits but rather sought relief for Santander''s alleged wrongful conduct in terminating her employment and misrepresenting her eligibility for benefits.

  5. Orabona contended that the district court improperly relied on the authenticity and applicability of the Severance Policy and related documents, and that further discovery was needed to determine whether the policy was truly an ERISA plan.'
