outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Reliance argued that the district court misinterpreted the policy’s mental or nervous disorder limitation by starting the 24‑month period in April 2021, and that under the policy language the 24‑month cap should have begun earlier because McEachin’s mental-health conditions had ''caused or contributed to'' her total disability prior to that date.

  2. Reliance contended that, giving independent effect to the terms ''caused by'' and ''contributed to'' in the limitation clause, the existence of mental-health treatment and symptoms before April 2021 meant those conditions contributed to McEachin’s disability and thus triggered the 24‑month limitation earlier than the district court held.

  3. Reliance further asserted that prior case law, including Okuno and Eastin, did not require the later start date adopted by the district court and that those precedents should be distinguished so as to permit application of the mental-health limitation once any mental condition contributed to the disability, even if physical conditions were also present.


  === Annette McEachin''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. McEachin argued that the district court erred in finding that, as of April 1, 2021, her physical conditions no longer rendered her totally disabled, asserting that her post‑April 2021 medical evidence and overall record showed she remained physically unable to perform her sedentary occupation with restrictions at that time.

  2. McEachin contended that, even if she was not physically totally disabled on April 1, 2021, the district court should have allowed her to use subsequent medical evidence from within the ensuing two‑year period to toll or pause the running of the 24‑month mental-disability limitation for those months in which her physical impairments again rendered her totally disabled, thereby extending her eligibility for benefits beyond April 2023.'
