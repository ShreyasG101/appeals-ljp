outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== David Keane''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Keane argued that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against Expeditors Hong Kong Limited for lack of personal jurisdiction, contending that Expeditors HK was subject to personal jurisdiction as the alter ego of Expeditors US due to overlapping leadership and alleged control.

  2. Keane contended that the district court erred in dismissing his contract claims against Expeditors US under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.

  3. Keane argued that the 2023 employment agreement designating Expeditors HK as his employer was a calculated move by the defendants to divest the U.S. District Court of jurisdiction over his claims.

  4. Keane alleged that Expeditors US exercised direct and substantial command over the business activities of Expeditors HK, supporting his theory that Expeditors HK''s actions should be imputed to Expeditors US.

  5. Keane claimed that the CEO of Expeditors US personally sanctioned the termination of his employment, and that Expeditors US should be held liable for the actions of Expeditors HK.

  6. Keane asserted that Expeditors HK and Expeditors US shared common management and that Expeditors HK was required to implement policies and directives promulgated by Expeditors US, further supporting his alter ego and imputation arguments.

  7. Keane argued that the district court should not have dismissed his claims because the only prior sexual harassment allegation against him occurred while he was employed by Expeditors US in Massachusetts, suggesting a factual connection to the forum.'
