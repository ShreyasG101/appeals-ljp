reason_for_appeal: '=== Matthew Byrnes''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his Title VII retaliation claim based on his termination, contending that under the McDonnell Douglas framework he presented sufficient circumstantial evidence for a jury to find that his firing was in retaliation for his protected activity of reporting Dr. Kessler’s alleged sexual harassment.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court wrongly concluded he could not establish the causation element of his prima facie case on the termination claim, asserting that a reasonable jury could find causation under a cat’s paw theory because Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey acted with retaliatory animus, intended their investigation and report to lead to his termination, and their actions were a but-for cause of the decision by the ultimate decisionmakers.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred in holding he failed to show pretext on the termination claim, asserting that Defendants’ stated reasons for firing him were inconsistent or uncorroborated, that the close temporal proximity between his renewed sexual-harassment complaints and his termination supported an inference of retaliation, that Defendants conducted a biased and one-sided investigation (including failing to interview him or key witnesses and relying on selective information), and that Defendants deviated from normal policies and procedures.

  4. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his Title VII retaliation claim based on Defendants’ reporting of four of his cases to the Kansas Board of Healing Arts (KBHA), asserting that he established a prima facie case because the reporting was a materially adverse action causally connected to his protected activity of complaining about Dr. Kessler’s alleged sexual harassment.

  5. Appellant contended that the district court incorrectly found no causal connection for the KBHA-reporting claim by treating the outside peer review committee as the decisionmaker; he argued instead that SCH, acting through Dr. Stucky and Dr. Green-Cheatwood—who knew of his protected activity and controlled which cases were selected, how they were processed, and which were reported—were the relevant actors and that their knowledge and conduct supported an inference of retaliatory motive.

  6. Appellant argued that, with respect to the KBHA-reporting claim, he presented sufficient evidence of pretext and retaliatory motive because Defendants treated him differently from similarly situated surgeons (including Drs. Gottschalk and Rink) in the peer review and reporting process, reported at least one of his cases that was not legally required to be reported, applied different review periods and criteria to his cases, and revealed his identity to the peer review chair, all of which suggested that the stated mandatory-reporting rationale was not the true reason for the KBHA reports.

  7. Appellant argued that, because his federal Title VII retaliation claims should not have been dismissed at summary judgment, the district court erred in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his related state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3), and that those state claims should be reinstated for further consideration.'
