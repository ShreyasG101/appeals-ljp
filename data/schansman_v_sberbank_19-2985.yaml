outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Sberbank of Russia PJSC''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Sberbank argued that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it is immune from suit under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), as it is an agency or instrumentality of the Russian Federation due to majority ownership by the Russian Ministry of Finance.

  2. Sberbank contended that the FSIA’s commercial activity exception does not apply to its conduct because the alleged claims are not based upon commercial activity carried on in the United States.

  3. Sberbank argued that, even if FSIA immunity is determined at the time the suit was filed, it was still immune because its then-majority owner, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, is a political subdivision of the Russian Federation, making Sberbank an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof.

  4. Sberbank asserted that it is immune under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), and that the ATA’s immunity provisions bar claims against Sberbank regardless of when it acquired agency or instrumentality status.

  5. Sberbank argued that the ATA’s immunity provision applies to instrumentalities as well as agencies of foreign states, and that the FSIA’s commercial activity exception does not apply to actions brought under the ATA.

  6. Sberbank contended that the only evidence of transfers to the DPR through Sberbank’s U.S. correspondent accounts consists of two small transfers totaling $300, which cannot constitute the core of the lawsuit or establish the gravamen of the claims as commercial activity in the United States.

  7. Sberbank raised procedural objections regarding the timing and scope of jurisdictional discovery ordered by the district court, including the degree of independence of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.'
