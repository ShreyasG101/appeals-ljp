MATSUMOTO, United States District Judge:                                  

In prior motions in limine before this Court,                   
Defendants failed to include any argument or analysis about the           
relevance of Penal Law § 70.45 to punitive damages.                       
Nonetheless, on November 18, 2022, the week before the start of           
trial, the Court provided the parties an opportunity to further           
brief Defendants’ request [176] [177] to “introduce evidence as           
to Penal Law § 70.45,” as Defendants had not specified what that          
evidence would be and belatedly argued that the evidence would            
be relevant to punitive damages.  The Court has reviewed the              
parties’ briefing [196] [197] regarding Defendants’ request to            
“introduce evidence as to Penal Law § 70.45” at trial.  The               
Court notes that Defendants included Penal Law § 70.45’s                  
legislative history and subsequent amendments, which Defendants           
                      1                                         
argue for the first time are also relevant to punitive damages.           
(ECF No. 198, Defendants’ Brief on Penal Law § 70.45, at 2.)              
The Court respectfully DENIES the Defendants’ request to                  

introduce Penal Law § 70.45, its legislative history, and                 
subsequent amendments at trial, for several independent reasons.          
First, Defendants repeatedly fail to explain what               
specific evidence about Penal Law § 70.45 they would seek to              
introduce at trial.  Despite this Court’s instructions,                   
Defendants do not state in their brief who in particular would            
testify as to Penal Law § 70.45 and what in particular those              
witnesses would say.  Instead, Defendants appear to make legal            
arguments about Penal Law § 70.45, including referencing                  
Plaintiff’s original complaint (id. at 1) and how subsequent              
amendments to Penal Law § 70.45 only later provided Defendants            
with authority to “initiate re-sentencings” (id. at 2) of                 

individuals who previously had had unconstitutional post-release          
supervision terms (“PRS”) imposed by Defendants.  (See id. at 3           
(“Although this Court found that Defendants were liable for not           
taking steps such as re-sentencings, Defendants should be                 
allowed to provide evidence that, as they understood the                  
statute, they had no authority to do so.”).)                              
Second, insofar as Defendants seek to have witnesses            
testify that they were relying on Penal Law § 70.45 during the            

                      2                                         
events relevant to this case, the Second Circuit has already              
rejected the Defendants’ argument that their unconstitutional             
conduct was excused by Penal Law § 70.45.  Earley v. Murray               
(“Earley I”), 451 F.3d 71, 76 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that the            

DOCS practice of adding PRS to a sentence where Penal Law §               
70.45 required it, but the sentencing judge had not imposed it,           
was unconstitutional), reh’g denied, 462 F.3d 147, 150 (2d Cir.           
2006) (“Earley II”); Betances v. Fischer (“Betances II”), 837             
F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 2016).  Specifically, in 2006, the Second          
Circuit found the administrative imposition of PRS by DOCS                
unconstitutional.  Earley I, 451 F.3d at 76.                              
In the instant action, Defendants, based on prior               
Second Circuit rulings, are liable to Plaintiff for                       
incarcerating him between June 12, 2007 to February 8, 2008               
because of an administratively imposed post-release supervision.          

The Second Circuit, by the time Plaintiff was incarcerated for            
violating his illegal term of PRS, had found that despite the             
existence of Penal Law § 70.45, Defendants could not                      
administratively impose PRS sentences.  Id. at 73, 76.                    
Therefore, despite the existence of Penal Law § 70.45 and any             
official’s understanding of it, any PRS administratively imposed          
by Defendants “was, quite simply, never a part of the sentence.”          
Id. at 76.  Defendants are liable for causing the administrative          

                      3                                         
imposition of the PRS sentence on Plaintiff by 2006.  Even after          
the Earley I decision had determined that any administratively            
and illegally imposed PRS sentence was not a constitutional or            

legal sentence, Defendants enforced Plaintiff’s administratively          
and illegally imposed term of PRS by incarcerating Plaintiff for          
violating PRS.                                                            
Defendants’ argument that they could properly rely on           
Penal Law § 70.45 after Earley I and Earley II is difficult to            
square with the statutory text and cannot be reconciled with              
Second Circuit precedent.  Penal Law § 70.45 has not ever, on             
its face, stated that DOCS was authorized to administratively             
impose post-release supervision; thus the existence of a state            
law does not excuse Defendants from scrupulously following the            
federal Constitution.                                                     
Moreover, the Second Circuit has held that Defendants           
did not have a legitimate basis for failing to follow Earley I.           

In 2016, the Second Circuit found that “[t]he [same] three                
[D]efendants became aware of Earley I’s holding at different              
times,” and noted that Defendant Annucci despite “immediately             
under[standing] Earley I’s holding [in 2006] . . . deliberately           
refused to change DOCS procedures to bring them into                      
compliance.”  Betances II, 837 F.3d at 167.  The Betances II              
court found that Defendant Fischer understood Earley I’s holding          

                      4                                         
but agreed with Defendant Annucci’s decision not to follow it.            
Id.  Defendant Tracy was also aware of and understood Earley I            
and decided not to follow it.  Instead, Defendant Tracy                   

“affirmatively decided to continue [the state agency’s] former            
approach in contravention of Earley I.”  Id. at 168.  Citing              
Defendants’ depositions and testimony, the Second Circuit                 
concluded that, in not making “an objectively reasonable effort           
to relieve plaintiffs of the burdens of those unlawfully imposed          
[PRS] terms after they knew it had been ruled that the                    
imposition violated federal law,”  “[a]ll three [Defendants]              
confirmed that their noncompliance was not the result of                  
oversight or confusion; they understood that Earley I required            
them to change their [unconstitutional] practices but                     
affirmatively decided not to do so.”  Id. at 167-69; 172-74.              
The Court finds that the Second Circuit’s decisions in          
Earley I, Earley II, and Betances preclude Defendants from                

rearguing whether they had a reasonable legal basis for ignoring          
the Court’s constitutional rulings.  Nonetheless, Defendants’             
belated motion requests leave to “introduce evidence as to Penal          
Law § 70.45” (and its legislative history and subsequent                  
amendments) “to provide evidence that they had no malicious               
intent and no callous disregard for not attempting, from June             
2007 to February 2008, to send a letter to Plaintiff’s                    

                      5                                         
sentencing court to urge the court and the district attorney to           
correct the omission of PRS from Plaintiff’s sentence.”  (ECF             
No. 198, Defendants’ Brief on § Penal Law 70.45, at 3.)                   

Defendants assert without citation to authority that “as a                
matter of due process” they should be permitted to submit all             
evidence of their state of mind.  (Id. at 1, 4-5.)                        
Notwithstanding Defendants’ arguments, in holding that even               
evidence relevant to a defendant’s state of mind may be excluded          
in a criminal case, the Supreme Court has instructed that “the            
proposition that the Due Process Clause guarantees the right to           
introduce all relevant evidence is simply indefensible.”                  
Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, 42 (1996) (plurality opinion);          
Lurie v. Wittner, 228 F.3d 113, 133 (2d Cir. 2000) (“Even                 
relevant testimony can be excluded, depending upon                        
circumstances, without offending due process.”).                          

Third, this Court does not find Penal Law § 70.45 to            
be relevant to Defendants’ defense against punitive damages.              
“[A] jury may be permitted to assess punitive damages in an               
action under § 1983 when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be           
motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless          
or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of              
others.”  Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 (1983); see                 
Wiercinski v. Mangia 57, Inc., 787 F.3d 106, 115 (2d Cir. 2015)           

                      6                                         
(“The Supreme Court has explained that punitive damages are               
appropriate only ‘when the defendant's conduct is shown to be             
motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless          

or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of              
others.’” (quoting Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass'n, 527 U.S. 526,             
536 (1999)); New Windsor Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Inc. v.               
Meyers, 442 F.3d 101, 121 (2d Cir. 2006) (“The fact that the              
constitutional violation does not warrant an award of                     
compensatory damages is not a basis for denying an award of               
punitive damages.” (quoting Robinson v. Cattaraugus County, 147           
F.3d 153, 161 (2d Cir. 1998)).                                            
Plaintiff has not sought to argue that Defendants               
acted with “evil motive” or “malice” in violating Plaintiff’s             
constitutional rights.  (ECF No. 197, Plaintiff’s Brief on Penal          
Law § 70.45, at 2) (“Plaintiff only needs to prove that                   

Defendants acted recklessly disregarded [sic] Plaintiff’s                 
rights, or intentionally violated federal law (citing to Smith            
at 51)).  Indeed, Defendants may testify that they did not act            
or fail to act with evil motive [or intent] or malice, but they           
may not invoke Penal Law § 70.45.  The Court respectfully                 
disagrees with Defendants’ contention that admission of Penal             
Law § 70.45 is necessary or relevant to “defend against claims            
of malice or evil intent.”  (ECF No. 198, Defendants Brief on             

                      7                                         
Penal Law § 70.45 at 6.)  Defendants fundamentally have failed            
to explain how Penal Law § 70.45 and their interpretation of              
that state statute provides a defense to what Plaintiff has               

asserted is Defendants’ “reckless or callous indifference” to             
his federal constitutional rights.  Smith, 461 U.S. at 56.                
Fourth, even if Penal Law § 70.45 were relevant to              
Defendants’ defense to punitive damages, which the Court                  
concludes it is not, given the Plaintiff’s punitive damages               
claim and the extensive record on Defendants’ conduct, the Court          
concludes that it cannot allow Defendants “introduce evidence as          
to Penal Law § 70.45” under the balancing required by Federal             
Rule of Evidence 403.  Any evidence that the parties seek to              
offer or exclude in their motions, even if relevant, is subject           
to the Court’s balancing of its probative and prejudicial value,          
as provided in Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  Rule 403 permits            

the exclusion of evidence, even if relevant, “if its probative            
value is substantially outweighed by a danger of . . . unfair             
prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue               
delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative                  
evidence.”  Fed. R. Evid. 403.  Courts have broad discretion in           
making decisions under Rule 403’s probative-prejudice balancing           
analysis.  See United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 131             
(2d Cir. 2010) (“We review a district court’s evidentiary                 

                      8                                         
rulings deferentially, mindful of its superior position to                
assess relevancy and to weigh the probative value of evidence             
against its potential for unfair prejudice.” (citing United               
States v. Royer, 549 F.3d 886, 901 (2d Cir. 2008)); see also              
United States v. Dwyer, 539 F.2d 924, 927 (2d Cir. 1976) (“In             

the balancing of probative value against unfair prejudice                 
required by Rule 403, the trial judge has wide discretion[.]”             
(quotation omitted)).                                                     
Granting Defendants’ broad and nebulous request to              
“introduce evidence as to Penal Law § 70.45” into this damages            
trial, after Defendants’ liability (including causation) for              
their unconstitutional conduct has not only been extensively              
litigated, but also repeatedly determined by the Second Circuit,          
would undoubtedly open the floodgates to evidence that is                 
irrelevant, would confuse the issues, mislead and confuse the             

jury, and unfairly prejudice the Plaintiff.

                 CONCLUSION                                     
For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES                     
Defendants’ overbroad and ill-defined request to “introduce               

evidence as to Penal Law § 70.45,” its legislative history, and           
subsequent amendments at trial.
