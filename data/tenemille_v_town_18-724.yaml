outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Ernst Theodore Tenemille''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in dismissing his employment discrimination action, alleging that his investigation and termination by the Town of Ramapo Police Department were due to discrimination based on his national origin and/or race, and as retaliation for his protected activity of questioning defendants’ access to his private medical information, in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and state law.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in finding his allegations related to his doctors’ notes insufficient to plausibly allege discriminatory intent, asserting that similarly situated white officers submitted identical doctors’ notes without legal challenge or investigation.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred in denying his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion for reconsideration, claiming that his motion alleged fraud by the defendants warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(3).'
