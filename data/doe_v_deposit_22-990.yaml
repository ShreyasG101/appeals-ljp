reason_for_appeal: '=== John Doe #1, John Doe #2, John Doe #3, John Doe #4, John Doe #5, John Doe #6, John Doe #7 (Plaintiffs-Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in vacating the writ of execution on the grounds that Ukraine’s nationalization of Prominvestbank (PIB) meant that PIB was no longer an instrumentality of the Taliban, even assuming it previously was.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that the delisting and unblocking of PIB’s assets by the Treasury Department did not defeat their pending TRIA execution, asserting that once a TRIA writ attaches to blocked assets, no executive action can defeat the execution.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that their ability to execute upon PIB’s assets was not extinguished by the Treasury Department’s action because they had invoked standard judicial processes as a terrorist judgment creditor and had served defendants with notice of the now-vacated writ.

  4. Plaintiffs asserted that 31 C.F.R. § 587.402 prevents subsequent executive action from affecting ongoing TRIA proceedings, and thus the unblocking of PIB’s assets should not impact their ability to execute on those assets.'
