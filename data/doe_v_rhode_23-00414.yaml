outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Rhode Island Interscholastic League''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in finding a causal connection between John Doe''s disability and his ineligibility under the Eight-Semester Rule, contending that Doe''s ineligibility was due to his voluntary decision to repeat the ninth grade, not his disability.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in concluding that waiving the Eight-Semester Rule for Doe would be a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, arguing that such a waiver would fundamentally alter the nature of the League''s interscholastic athletics program.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred in its analysis of the essential nature of the Eight-Semester Rule, asserting that the Rule is foundational to the League''s mission of promoting fair competition and maximum participation.

  4. Appellant asserted that the district court improperly relied on subsequent events (Doe''s second transfer) rather than the initial reclassification as the cause of ineligibility, and that the disability was not a but-for cause of Doe''s exclusion under the Rule.'
