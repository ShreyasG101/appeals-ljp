reason_for_appeal: '=== John Conti''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court failed to apply the proper test for preemption as outlined in the Supreme Court''s Cantero decision.

  2. Appellant contended that, applying the Cantero standard, Citizens Bank had not shown that the Rhode Island statute significantly interferes with federal-banking power such that it should be preempted under the National Bank Act.'
