outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. State Teachers argued that the district court erred in finding that their complaint failed to adequately allege that Charles River''s statements to investors were false and misleading, specifically regarding the impact of the federal indictment on Charles River''s supply chain.

  2. State Teachers contended that the district court incorrectly determined that their complaint did not adequately allege scienter, asserting that Charles River knowingly or recklessly misled investors as to problems in its supply chain.

  3. State Teachers argued that Charles River''s repeated statements in SEC disclosures over the class period that it ''may'' be required to source macaques from ''non-preferred vendors'' were false and misleading because Charles River was already relying on suppliers subject to law-enforcement scrutiny.

  4. State Teachers challenged the district court''s failure to address loss causation, maintaining that their complaint adequately alleged that their losses were caused by Charles River''s misdirection.'
