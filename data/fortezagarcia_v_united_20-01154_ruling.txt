IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT                        
                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO                          

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                                                

      Plaintiff,                                                         

          v.                       CIVIL. NO. 20-1154 (RAM)              
ANGEL FORTEZA-GARCIA,                                                    

      Defendant.                                                         

                       OPINION AND ORDER                                 
RAÚL M. ARIAS-MARXUACH, District Judge                                    
    Pending before the Court is Petitioner Angel Forteza-García’s        
Second Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence (“Second           
Motion”)  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2255.  (Docket  No.  2).  The      
Assistant Federal Public Defender also filed a Memorandum of Law          
in Support of Petitioner’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Motion (“Memorandum in        
Support”) filed on Defendant’s behalf. (Docket No. 13). While the         
Assistant  Federal  Public  Defender  has  competently  presented         
Petitioner’s case, having considered the arguments of the parties,        
the Court DENIES Petitioner’s Second Motion. (Docket Nos. 2, 13,          
16 and 17). No certificate of appealability shall issue as the            
Second Motion fails to make a substantial showing of the denial of        
a  constitutional  right  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2253(c)(2).  In    
accordance with Rule 22(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate           
Procedure, Petitioner may still seek a certificate directly from          
the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (“First          
Circuit”).                                                                
                         I.   BACKGROUND                                 
 A. Criminal Case No. 03-cr-0073-2 (JAF)1                                

    On  March  12,  2003  a  Grand  Jury  returned  the  original        
indictment in Case No. 03-cr-0073-2 (JAF). (Docket No. 7). The 6-         
count   indictment  charged   Petitioner   Angel   Forteza-García         
(“Petitioner”  or   “Forteza-García”)  and  co-defendants   Angel         
Forteza-García and David Gómez-Olmeda with robbing and murdering          
A.V.G., a confidential informant. Id.                                     
    On September 24, 2003, Petitioner plead guilty to Count Three        
of  the  original  Indictment  in  Criminal  Case  no.  03-cr-0073-2      
pursuant to a plea agreement. (Docket Nos. 7 and 124). Count Three        
charged Petitioner and his co-defendants with a violation of 18           
U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(3) and 924 (j) and 2 in the course of committing         
a violation of Title 18 U.S.C. § 2114 (robbery of mail or any money       

or property of the United States). Id.                                    
    Judgment was entered against Forteza-García on January 15,           
2004 and he was sentenced to Three-Hundred Twenty-Four (324) months       
of imprisonment and five (5) years of supervised release. (Docket         
No. 187).

 B. Civil Case No. 20-01154 (RAM)                                        
    In  the  Memorandum  in  Support,  Petitioner  posits  that  his     
conviction  under  18  U.S.C.  §§  924(c)  and  924(j)  and  2  for       
unlawfully possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in relation to        
a crime of violence resulting in murder as defined in 18 U.S.C. §         

1111 must be vacated. (Docket No. 13 at 1). Petitioner avers that         
the predicate crime underlying the Section 924(c) and (j) and 2           
convictions, 18 U.S.C. 2114(a) (assault and robbery of money or           
property of the United States or “postal robbery”), is not “a crime       
of violence” under Section 924(c)(3)(A) (the “force clause”). Id.         
at  1-2.  Petitioner  argues  that:  (a)  postal  robbery  does  “not     
necessarily  require  as  an  element,  the  actual,  threatened,  or     
attempted use of force[,]” and (b) the least culpable form of             
postal robbery criminalizes “rather minimal” force not “capable of        
causing physical pain or injury to another person.” Id. at 8-13.          
    The Government responds that 18 U.S.C. § 2114 is a “crime of         
violence” because according to multiple Circuit Courts, the word          

“rob” in the statute refers to common-law robbery which requires          
force or violence. (Docket No. 16 at 6-8). The Government also            
argues that Petitioner’s Section 924(c) conviction is predicated          
on  the  “aggravated  modality”  of  18  U.S.C.  2114(a).  Id.  at  8.    
Lastly, the Government points to case law from the United States          
District Court for District of Puerto Rico (“District of Puerto           
Rico”) and other United States Circuit Courts of Appeals which            
have concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a)’s “aggravated modality” is        
a “crime of violence.” Id. at 9-10.                                       
    The Court need not determine whether robbery or assault in           
the  first  part  of  18  U.S.C.  §  2114(a)  constitute  “crimes  of     
violence.” Nor must it determine whether the offense in 18 U.S.C.         

§  2114(a)  is  not  a  “crime  of  violence”  under  18   U.S.C.         
924(c)(3)(B) (the “residual clause”) because the Supreme Court of         
the United States has already declared the residual clause void           
for vagueness. See United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319 (2019).        
Instead, for the following reasons explained below, the Court holds       
that the predicate offense in this case is 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a)’s          
“aggravated offense” which is a “crime of violence” under Section         
924(c)(3)(A)’s “force clause.”                                            
    First, 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) is a divisible statute with an            
aggravated offense that provides for enhanced penalties when a            
victim is wounded, or the victim’s life is put in jeopardy using          
a  dangerous  weapon.  Persuasive  precedent  from  several  United       

States Courts of Appeals and the District of Puerto Rico have held        
that the aggravated offense in 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) constitutes a          
“crime of violence” under Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s “force clause.”          
    Second,  applying  the  modified  categorical  approach  by          
examining the Indictment, the Plea Agreement, and the plea colloquy       
confirms that Petitioner plead guilty to the aggravated offense in        
18 U.S.C. § 2114(a).                                                      
                     II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW                             
    Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, a prisoner in custody under a sentence       
of a Federal Court may move the Court that imposed the sentence to        
vacate, set aside or correct the sentence:                                
         [U]pon  the  ground  that  the  sentence  was                   
         imposed in violation of the Constitution or                     
         laws of the United States, or that the court                    
         was  without  jurisdiction  to  impose   such                   
         sentence, or that the sentence was in excess                    
         of  the  maximum  authorized  by  law  or  is                   
         otherwise subject to collateral attack.                         

    A petitioner’s post-conviction request for relief “must show         
that  his  sentence  ‘reveal[s]  fundamental  defects  which,  if         
uncorrected, will result in a complete miscarriage of justice.’”          
Gandia-Maysonet v. United States, 2020 WL 5646457, at *2 (D.P.R.          
2020) (quoting Lebron Ortiz v. United States, 2015 WL 2400746, at         
*2  (D.P.R.  2015)).  Thus,  the  petitioner  bears  the  burden  of      
establishing the defect. Id.                                              
    Likewise, “[w]hen a petition is brought under section 2255,          
the petitioner bears the burden of establishing the need for an           
evidentiary hearing.” U.S. v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir.          
1993) (citations omitted). To determine whether the petitioner has        
met this burden, “the court must take many of petitioner’s factual        
averments as true,” but it need not “give weight to conclusory            
allegations,   self-interested   characterizations,   discredited         
inventions, or opprobrious epithets.” Id. (citation omitted). A           
hearing on such a petition “generally is not necessary when a §           
2255 motion (1) is inadequate on its face, or (2) although facially       
adequate is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the           
files and records of the case.” Moran v. Hogan, 494 F.2d 1220,            
1222 (1st Cir. 1974). Simply put, a Section 2255 motion “‘may be          
denied without a hearing as to those allegations which, if accepted       

as true, entitle the movant to no relief, or which need not be            
accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts,         
contradict the record, or are inherently incredible.’” McGill, 11         
F.3d at 226 (quoting Shraiar v. United States, 736 F.2d 817, 818          
(1st Cir. 1984)) (internal quotation omitted).                            
                         III.  DISCUSSION                                
    No hearing has been requested or is necessary in this case           
because  the  Petition  presents  only  legal  issues  and  does  not     
require  resolving  any  disputed  factual  issues.  See  Gandia-         
Maysonet, 2020 WL 5646457, at *2 (quoting Miller v. United States,        
564 F.2d 103, 106 (1st Cir. 1977)) (“Where there are no disputed          
facts crucial to the outcome, leaving only questions of law, [§]          

2255 does not require a hearing; the motion may be decided [...]          
without oral presentation”).                                              
 A. Section  924  (C)(3)(A)  and  the  approaches  to  analysis  of      
    whether a predicate offense is a “crime of violence”.                

    Section 924(c)(1) provides for enhanced penalties to:                
         [A]ny person who, during and in relation to                     
         any  crime  of  violence  or  drug  trafficking                 
         crime (including a crime of violence or drug                    
         trafficking  crime   that  provides  for   an                   
         enhanced punishment if committed by the use of                  
         a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for                     
         which the person may be prosecuted in a court                   
         of  the  United  States,  uses  or  carries  a                  
         firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such                     
         crime, possesses a firearm[.]                                   

18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1). Furthermore, Section 924(c)(3) contains two        
definitions of the statutory term “crime of violence.” A “crime of        
violence” is one that:                                                    
         (A)  has as an element the use, attempted use,                  
         or threatened use of physical force against                     
         the person or property of another, or                           

         (B)     that  by  its   nature,  involves   a                   
         substantial risk that physical force against                    
         the person or property of another may be used                   
         in the course of committing the offense.                        

18 U.S.C. § 924 (c)(3). Section 924(c)(3)(A) is known as the “force       
clause”. See United States v. Rose, 896 F.3d. 104, 106 (1st Cir.          
2018).  Whereas  section  924(c)(3)(B)  is  known  as  the  “residual     
clause.” Id. The Court need not dwell on subsection “B” as it has         
been declared unconstitutional. See Davis, 139 S. Ct. at 2336.            
    As  explained  by  the  First  Circuit,  the  first  step  in        
determining  whether  a  statute  is  a  “crime  of  violence”  under     
Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s force clause, is to ascertain “whether the         
criminal  statute  of  the  predicate  offense  is  indivisible  or       
divisible.” King v. United States, 965 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2020).       
An  indivisible  statute  contains  a  “single,  indivisible  set  of     
elements[,]”  instead  of  containing  alternative  elements,  “that      
criminalizes a broader swath of conduct than the relevant generic         
offense.” Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 258 (2013).            
This  indivisible  statute  may  also  “enumerate[]  various  factual     
means of committing a single element.” United States v. Faust, 853        
F.3d 39, 52 (1st Cir. 2017); see also Mathis v. United States, 136        
S.Ct.  2243,  2249  (2016)  (providing  hypothetical  examples  of        

indivisible  statutes).  Conversely,  a  statute  is   considered         
“divisible” when it “sets out one or more elements of the offense         
in  the   alternative[,]”  thereby  “listing  potential   offense         
elements.” Descamps, 570 U.S. at 257, 260. A “divisible” statute          
therefore “comprises multiple, alternative versions of the crime.”        
Id. at 262. Moreover, when “statutory alternatives carry different        
punishments, then . . . they must be elements.” Mathis, 136 S.Ct.         
at 2256.                                                                  
    To determine whether an indivisible statute is a “crime of           
violence,” courts apply a “categorical approach” that considers           
“the elements of the crime of conviction, not the facts of how it         
was committed, and assess[es] whether violent force is an element         

of the crime.” United States v. Taylor, 848 F.3d 476, 491 (1st            
Cir.  2017)  (emphasis  added).  However,  for  divisible  statutes,      
courts use a “modified categorical approach.” This approach is            
used when certain “alternative elements require the use, attempted        
use, or threatened use of physical force while others do not[.]”          
King, 956 F.3d at 66. It consists of analyzing a limited set of           
Shepard  documents   “such  as  the   charging  documents,   plea         
agreements, plea colloquies, jury instructions, and verdict forms         
[...] to determine which of the statute’s alternative elements            
formed  the  basis  of  the  prior  conviction.”  United  States  v.      
Delgado-Sánchez, 849 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2017) (quoting United            
States v. Castro-Vazquez, 802 F.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir. 2015). The            

objective of looking at those documents is to “determine which of         
the  enumerated  alternatives  within  the  statute  constituted  the     
actual  crime  of  conviction.”  King,  965  F.3d  at  66  (citation      
omitted).  These  documents  also  help  the  sentencing  court  to       
“compare[] only this specific offense with the relevant generic           
offense.” United States v. Burghardt, 939 F.3d 397, 406 (1st Cir.         
2019) (citing Mathis, 136 S.Ct. at 2249). Moreover, “under the            
modified categorical approach, if the crime of conviction involves        
the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against       
the person or property of another, then the offense qualifies a           
crime of violence under § 924(c)’s force clause.” King, 965 F.3d          
at 66 (citation omitted).                                                 

 B. The aggravated offense in 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) is a “crime of         
    violence” for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A)’s force           
    clause.                                                              

    Forteza-García  contends  that  “basic  postal  robbery,”  18        
U.S.C. § 2114(a), the underlying crime to his 924(c)(3) conviction,       
, is not a “crime of violence” for purposes of 924(c)(3)(A)’s force       
clause because it purportedly criminalizes “rather minimal force”         
that does not require “force capable of causing physical pain or          
injury to another person.” (Docket No. 13 at 10-12). The Court            
disagrees. 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) is a divisible statute with an             
aggravated offense that is categorically a predicate “crime of            
violence” under Section 924(c)(3)(A)’s force clause. Application          
of the modified categorical approach leads to the conclusion that         

Forteza-García plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a)’s aggravated           
offense.                                                                  
    The postal robbery statute provides that:                            

         A person who assaults any person having lawful                  
         charge, control, or custody of any mail matter                  
         or of any money or other property of the United                 
         States, with intent to rob, steal, or purloin                   
         such mail matter, money, or other property of                   
         the United States, or robs or attempts to rob                   
         any  such  person  of  mail  matter,  or  of  any               
         money, or other property of the United States,                  
         shall, for the first offense, be imprisoned                     
         not more than ten years; and if in effecting                    
         or attempting to effect such robbery he wounds                  
         the person having custody of such mail, money,                  
         or  other  property  of  the  United  States,  or               
         puts  his  life  in  jeopardy  by  the  use  of  a              
         dangerous weapon, or for a subsequent offense,                  
         shall be imprisoned not more than twenty-five                   
         years.(Emphasis added).                                         

18 U.S.C. § 2114(a). While the First Circuit has not weighed in on        
the issue, multiple United States Courts of Appeals have concluded        
that 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) is a divisible statute. As the highlighted       
text  after  the  semicolon  shows,  the  statute  provides  for  an      
increased penalty of imprisonment of up to twenty-five years when         
in the course of the assault or robbery the defendant: (1) wounds         
the person having custody of property of the United States; or (2)        
puts  the  person’s  life  in  jeopardy  by  the  use  of  a  dangerous   
weapon. See United States v. Bryant, 949 F.3d 168, 174 (4th Cir.          
2020); Knight v. United States 936 F.3d 495, 498-99 (6th Cir.             
2019); United States v. Enoch, 865 F.3d 575, 5801-81 (7th Cir.            

2017), cert. denied 138 S.Ct. 1015 (2018); United States v. Thomas,       
703 F. App'x 72, 78 (3d Cir. 2017) (affirming appellant’s § 924(c)        
conviction  because  “the  jury  had  an  adequate  factual  basis  to    
conclude  that § 2114(a),  committed  while  using  and  carrying  a      
firearm, is a crime of violence.”); In re Watts, 829 F.3d 1287,           
1289-90 (11th Cir. 2016).                                                 
    Other judges in the District of Puerto Rico have reached the         
same conclusion. See Rojas-Tapia v. United States, 2020 WL 3690398,       
at *5 (D.P.R. 2020). The Court held therein that “Circuit Courts          
have  determined  that  18  U.S.C.  §  2114(a)  carries  a  ‘separate     
aggravated  offense  that  includes  the  wounding  or  putting  the      
victim’s life in jeopardy by the use of dangerous weapon.’” Id.           

(emphasis in original); see also, Rojas-Tapia v. United States,           
458 F.Supp. 3d 111, 119-121 (D.P.R. 2020). The Court further notes        
that Petitioner and the Government agree that we are dealing with         
a divisible statute. (Docket Nos. 13 at 8-9, 12; 16 at 8).                
    The aggravated offense in 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) is “crime of           
violence” for Section 924 purposes because “wounding” and putting         
a  victim’s  life  “in  jeopardy”  with  a  “dangerous  weapon”  are      
elements that entail “the use, attempted use, or threatened use of        
physical force against the person.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A). The         
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (“Seventh Circuit”) reached a            
similar conclusion in United States v. Enoch when it concluded            
that the second part of 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) is a crime of violence        

under  Section  924(c)(3)’s  force  clause  in  a  case  involving        
brandishing of a weapon. See Enoch, 865 F.3d at 582. As aptly put         
by the Seventh Circuit:                                                   
         We cannot see how a defendant can brandish a                    
         gun in such a manner as to put the life of a                    
         victim  in  jeopardy  without  committing  an                   
         offense  that  “has  as  an  element  the  use,                 
         attempted use, or threatened use of physical                    
         force  against  the  person  and  property  of                  
         another.”                                                       

Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A)) (emphasis added). See also         
United States v. Dowd, 451 F.3d 1244, 1252 n.8 (11th Cir. 2006)           
(holding that the aggravated § 2114(a) violations stemming from           
the fact that the appellant placed the victim’s life in jeopardy          
by using a dangerous weapon “undisputedly describes a crime of            
violence.”); Rojas-Tapia, 2020 WL 36960398, at *5 (holding that           
Petitioner‘s conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) was a “crime of         
violence”  under  Section  924(c)’s  force  clause  because  he  used     
firearms and placed the lives of postal employees in danger).             
    Pursuant  to  the  modified  categorical  approach,  the  Court      
reviewed the Indictment, the Plea Agreement, and the plea colloquy.       
(Case  No.  03-cr-0073-2,  Docket  Nos.  7,  124  and  232).  These       
documents  show  that  the  predicate  offense  underlying  Forteza-      
García’s  Section  924(c)  conviction  is  18  U.S.C.  §  2114(a)’s       
aggravated offense because Petitioner agreed to plead guilty to           
the elements of “wounding” and putting A.V.G.’s life “in jeopardy”        

with a “dangerous weapon” in the course of assaulting A.V.G with          
the intent to rob, steal or purloin money of the United States            
that’s was within A.V.G.’s custody. (Case No. 03-cr-0073-2, Docket        
No.  232  at  18).  Thus,  Forteza-García’s  Section  924(c)  and  (j)    
convictions are valid.                                                    
    In the Plea Agreement, Petitioner plead guilty to Count Three        
of the original Indictment which states that Petitioner and his           
co-defendants:                                                            
         [A]aiding and abetting each other, and, aided                   
         and  abetted  by  others  to  the  Grand  Jury                  
         unknown,  did  willfully,  intentionally  and                   
         unlawfully  possess,  use  or  carry  a  firearm                
         during  and  in   relation  to  a  crime   of                   
         violence…that is assaulting an individual who                   
         lawfully had charge, control, or custody of                     
         money  of  the  United  States,  with  intent  to               
         rob,  steal,  or  purloin  said  money,  as  set                
         forth in COUNT ONE herein, which is realleged                   
         and  incorporated  by  reference  herein,  an                   
         offense  that  they  could  be  prosecuted  in  a               
         court of the United States as a violation to                    
         Title 18, United States Code, Section 2114,                     
         and, in the course of that crime of violence,                   
         the  defendants   herein  unlawfully   killed                   
         A.V.G., with malice aforethought through the                    
         use of a firearm, which is murder, as defined,                  
         in Title 19 United States Code Section 1111,                    
         by  knowingly,  willfully,  deliberately  and                   
         maliciously  and  with  premeditation  shooting                 
         A.V.G. with a firearm thus causing his death,                   
         all  in  violation  of  Title  18  United  States               
         Code Section 924 (j) and 2.                                     

(Case No. 03-cr-0073-2, Docket No. 7 at 2-3; 124 at 1-2) (emphasis        
added). The Indictment charged Petitioner and his co-defendants           
with possessing and using a dangerous weapon, that is the firearm,        
during the assault, robbery and killing of A.V.G. who had charge,         
control, or custody of money of the United States. (Docket No. 7          
at 2-3). To state the obvious, a firearm is a dangerous weapon            
because “as used or attempted to be used, [it] may endanger the           
life of or inflict great bodily harm on a person.” Taylor, 848            
F.3d at 493-494; see also Rojas-Tapia, 2020 WL 3960398, at *6             
(identifying  a  9mm  pistol,  a  .40  caliber  semi-automatic  Glock     
pistol, and a semi-automatic AK-47 type assault rifle as “dangerous       
weapons.”). Thus, Count Three stated all of the elements of a             
violation of 18 U.S.C.§ 2114(a)’s aggravated offense. (Case No.           
03-cr-0073-2, Docket Nos. 124 at 1-2; 232 at 17-18). In particular,       
the Transcript of the September 24, 2003 Change of Plea reflects          
where  Petitioner  was  read  Count  Three  by  the  Court  and  he       
acknowledged the charges. (Case No. 03-cr-0073-2, Docket No. 232          
at 10, 17-18, 26).                                                        
    By pleading guilty to Count Three, Petitioner plead guilty to        
the  aggravated  offense  in  18  U.S.C.  §  2114(a)  because  the        

indictment alleged that A.V.G. was wounded (mortally) and his life        
was placed in jeopardy (taken) with a dangerous weapon in the             
course of assaulting and robbing him while he had custody of money        
belonging to the United States.  Moreover, even though Petitioner         
did not plead guilty to Count One of the Indictment, that is a            
violation to 18 U.S.C. § 20114(a), the plea colloquy demonstrates         

that Petitioner agreed to plead guilty to a charge wherein he             
admitted  to  having  been  involved  in  the  assault,  killing  and     
robbing of A.V.G. with a firearm. Id. at 18, 26, 30-31. Similarly,        
during the plea colloquy and after the Government’s proffer of the        
factual basis for Count Three, the Court asked Petitioner whether         
he accepted his involvement in the killing and robbing of A.V.G.          
and Petitioner replied in the affirmative “Yes.” Id. at 40. Thus,         
Petitioner admitted to having committed the predicate offense. As         
stated by several United States Courts of Appeals “[b]y its plain         
language, section  924  does  not  require  that  a  defendant  be        
convicted of, or even charged with, the predicate offense to be           
found guilty of using or carrying a firearm in relation to the            

predicate offense.” United States v. Frye, 402 F.3d 1123, 1127            
(11th Cir. 2005). See also United States v. Munoz-Fabela, 896 F.2d        
908, 911 (5th Cir. 1990) (“[I]t is only the fact of the offense,          
and not a conviction, that is needed to establish the required            
predicate.”); Harris v. United States, 2013 WL 12450621, at *3            
(M.D. Fla. 2013) (“[A] defendant does not have to be convicted of,        
or even charged with, the predicate offense to be found guilty of         
using  or  carrying  a  firearm  in  relation  to  the  predicate         
offense. Section 924 requires only that the crime of violence be          
one that “may be prosecuted.”)                                            
    Petitioner also contends that the Court should focus on the          
least culpable conduct captured by the aggravated modality of 18          

U.S.C. § 2114(a), a “simple robbery” which he argues is not a crime       
of violence. (Docket No. 13 at 12-13). But, the whole point of            
engaging in the modified categorical approach in the face of a            
divisible  statute  is  to  determine  “if  the  crime  of  conviction    
involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical            
force  against  the  person  or  property  of  another,”  thereby         
“qualifyi[ng]  as  a  crime  of  violence  under  §  924(c)’s  force      
clause.”  King,  965  F.3d  at  66.  As  shown  above,  Petitioner’s      
conviction included the element of “wounding” and “placing the            
person’s life in jeopardy through the use of a dangerous weapon”          
which undoubtedly qualifies his 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a)’s aggravated          
offense as a “crime of violence.”                                         

         Lastly, First Circuit precedent precludes any potential         
argument that “aiding and abetting” a “crime of violence” does not        
satisfy 924(c)’s force clause. According to First Circuit case            
law, 18 U.S.C. § 2 “makes an aider and abettor ‘punishable as the         
principal,’ and thus no different for purposes of the categorical         
approach than one who commits the substantive offense.” United            
States v. García-Ortiz, 904 F.3d 102, 109 (1st Cir. 2018) (citation       
omitted). See also Gonzales v. Duenas Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 189          
(2007)  (“[E]very   jurisdiction—all  States   and  the   Federal         
Government—has  ‘expressly   abrogated  the  distinction’   among         
principals  and  aiders  and  abettors”.);  Ocasio-Ruiz  v.  United       
States, 2020 WL 4437858, at *9 n. 15 (D.P.R. 2020) (“[T]he fact           

that Petitioner was charged as an “aider an abettor” does nothing         
to change the underlying crime's category of “crime of violence”.);       
Rojas-Tapia,  2020  WL  36960398,  at  *5  (holding  that  “since  the    
‘separate aggravated offense’ of 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) is a ‘crime          
of  violence’,  the   aiding  and  abetting  conviction   against         
Petitioner constitutes a ‘crime of violence’ in itself.”). The            
Court sees no reason to rule any differently in the case at bar.          
 C. No certificate of appealability will be issued.                      
    28 U.S.C.A. § 2253(c)(2) establishes that a District Court           
judge may only issue a certificate of appealability of a section          
2255 proceeding “if the applicant has made a substantial showing          
of the denial of a constitutional right.” In this case, the Court         

will not issue a certificate of appealability because Petitioner          
has failed to make such a showing. See Morales Torres v. United           
States, 2019 WL 4744217 at *3 (D.P.R. 2019) (denying certificate          
of appealability in a case dismissing Section 2255 petition because       
Hobbs Act Robbery is a predicate crime of violence under Section          
924 (c)’s force clause).                                                  
                         IV.  CONCLUSION                                 
    Based  on  the  foregoing,  Petitioner  Angel  Forteza-García’s
