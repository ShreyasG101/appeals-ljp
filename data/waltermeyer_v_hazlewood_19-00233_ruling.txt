UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT                             
          FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

Diane L. Kistler                                                          
                       O R D E R                                     
Pro se plaintiff Broc T. Waltermeyer alleges that defendants, former Warden 
of the Berlin, New Hampshire Federal Correctional Institution (“FCI Berlin”) 
Robert Hazlewood and an FCI Berlin physician, Diane L. Kistler, violated his 
Eighth Amendment rights. Waltermeyer seeks money damages pursuant to Bivens 
v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), 
claiming that defendants provided inadequate medical treatment during his 
incarceration at FCI Berlin. Defendants moved to dismiss Waltermeyer’s Bivens 
claim. Doc. no. 33. The Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation 
(“R&R”) on December 28, 2023, recommending that the district court deny the 
motion to dismiss. Doc. no. 38. Defendants object. Doc. no. 44. The court rejects the 
R&R for the reasons explained below.                                      
                    BACKGROUND                                       
The United States Supreme Court has recognized only three factual contexts 

in which a plaintiff may bring a Bivens claim: (1) a Fourth Amendment claim 
consisting of facts comparable to Bivens itself, see Bivens, 403 U.S. 388 at 389-91; 
(2) a Fifth Amendment Equal Protection Clause claim for sex discrimination, see 
Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228 (1979); and (3) an Eighth Amendment claim for 
inadequate medical treatment, see Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14 (1980). See 

Quinones-Pimentel v. Cannon, 85 F.4th 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2023) (summarizing legal 
landscape). It is undisputed that Waltermeyer’s Bivens claim for inadequate 
medical treatment invokes Carlson.                                        
Since Carlson, the Supreme Court has “consistently” refused to extend Bivens 
despite numerous opportunities to do so. See Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 137 
(2017); Quinones-Pimentel, 85 F.4th at 69 (collecting Supreme Court cases). At the 
same time, the Supreme Court has not overruled Bivens. Egbert v. Boule, 596 U.S. 

482, 491 (2022) (“[R]ather than dispense with Bivens altogether, we have  
emphasized that recognizing a cause of action under Bivens is ‘a disfavored judicial 
activity.’” (quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 135)). Instead, the Court has imposed “a 
highly restrictive two-step analysis,” which limits when claims for damages against 
federal officers may proceed. Bulger v. Hurwitz, 62 F.4th 127, 136-37 (4th Cir. 
2023).                                                                    

The two-step analysis proceeds as follows: under the first step, the court must 
determine whether the claim seeks to apply Bivens in a “new context.” Egbert, 596 
U.S. at 492. A claim arises in a new context if it is “meaningfully different” from the 
three cases in which the Supreme Court has authorized damages claims against 
federal officers for constitutional violations. Id. Meaningful differences may include:  
     the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at  
     issue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the 
     extent  of judicial  guidance  as to  how  an  officer  should  
     respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; the       
     statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer        
     was  operating;  the  risk  of  disruptive  intrusion  by  the  
     Judiciary  into  the  function  of  other  branches;  or  the   
     presence of potential special factors that previous Bivens      
     cases did not consider.                                         
Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 140 (emphasis added). Thus, a meaningful difference exists 
where a claim presents “special factors” that the Supreme Court did not consider in 
one of the three original Bivens cases.                                   
If there are meaningful differences that place the plaintiff’s claim in a new 
context, the court proceeds to the second step. Egbert, 596 U.S. at 492. In Egbert, 
the Supreme Court explained that “a new context arises when there are ‘potential 
special factors that previous Bivens cases did not consider.’” Egbert, 596 U.S. at 492 
(quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 137). Most importantly for the instant case, Egbert v. 
Boule holds that an alternative remedial structure may be one of the many “special 
factor[s]” that the three previous Bivens actions did not consider. See id. at 492-93; 
Noe v. United States, No. 23-1025, 2023 WL 8868491, at *3 (10th Cir. Dec. 22, 
2023); Silva v. United States, 45 F.4th 1134, 1139 (10th Cir. 2022); Arias v. Herzon, 
--- F. Supp. 3d ---, 17-cv-516-LM, 2023 WL 4204657, at *5 (D.N.H. June 27, 2023) 
(“[T]he Supreme Court made clear that an alternative remedial structure is a 
‘special factor’ which courts must give heightened consideration.”).      
This means that, after Egbert, the two-step framework “often resolves to a 
single question: whether there is any reason to think that Congress might be better 
equipped to create a damages remedy.” Egbert, 596 U.S. at 492. Stated another 
way: “[Whether] Congress already . . . provided, or . . . authorized the Executive to 
provide, an ‘alternative remedial structure.’” Id. 494 (internal citations omitted) 
(quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 137 (2017)). If the court answers that question in the 

affirmative, then the Bivens claim does not survive.                      
As the Court in Egbert recognized, it denied relief “for two independent 
reasons: Congress is better positioned to create remedies in the border-security 
context, and the Government already has provided alternative remedies that 
protect plaintiffs . . . .” Id. (emphasis added). Ultimately, Egbert is unequivocal: “[a] 
court faces only one question: whether there is any rational reason (even one) to 
think that Congress is better suited to ‘weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a 

damages action to proceed.’” Id. at 496 (quoting Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 136).  
The bottom line is that Egbert precludes a Bivens claim where there is a new 
alternative remedial structure available to the plaintiff. See Noe, 2023 WL 8868491, 
at *3; Silva, 45 F.4th at 1139; Arias, 2023 WL 4204657, at *5. As the Tenth Circuit 
explained in Noe v. United States, where—as here—a plaintiff brings a Carlson 
claim despite having the availability of the Bureau of Prisons’s (“BOP”)  

Administrative Remedy Program (“ARP”) during his incarceration, the district court 
must dismiss the claim as a matter of law. Noe, 2023 WL 8868491, at *3. Following 
Egbert, “the availability of the ARP is sufficient to foreclose a Bivens claim despite 
any factual similarity between the two.” Id. In Noe, the Tenth Circuit concluded 
that it “need not decide whether [the plaintiff’s] case is meaningfully different from 
Carlson because in the wake of Egbert and Silva v. United States, the availability of 
the ARP is sufficient to foreclose a Bivens claim despite any factual similarity 
between the two.” Id. (internal citation omitted).                        

        APPLICATION OF EGBERT TO THIS CASE                           
The Tenth Circuit’s decision in Noe is on all fours with Waltermeyer’s case. 
Regardless of the similarity between Waltermeyer’s alleged circumstances and the 
facts in Carlson, the ARP’s existence eliminates any possibility that his claim 
survives. There is no discovery that could breathe life into this claim.  

The more recent cases from the Supreme Court, see Egbert, 596 U.S. at 491, 
Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 133, Hernandez v. Mesa, 140 S. Ct. 735, 741 (2020), make 
crystal clear that the Court views the original, court-created Bivens remedy as 
violating fundamental separation of powers principles. See Egbert, 596 U.S. at 502 
(Gorsuch, J., concurring) (“Our Constitution’s separation of powers prohibits federal 
courts from assuming legislative authority. As the Court today acknowledges, 
Bivens crossed that line . . . .” (internal citation omitted)); Abbasi, 582 U.S. at 13 

(“[I]t is a significant step under separation-of-powers principles for a court to 
determine that it has the authority, under the judicial power, to create and enforce 
a cause of action for damages against federal officials in order to remedy a 
constitutional violation.”); Hernandez, 140 S. Ct. at 739 (“As we have made clear in 
many prior cases, however, the Constitution’s separation of powers requires us to 
exercise caution before extending Bivens to a new ‘context,’ . . . .”).   

Those separation of powers principles animate the decisions in Egbert and 
Abbasi. In cases where an alternative remedial scheme (that was not considered by 
the Court in Carlson) exists, Egbert and Abbasi command the lower courts to 
exercise judicial restraint and defer to the authority of the executive (or legislative) 
branch that provided the alternative remedy.                              

The R&R attempts to distinguish my decision in Arias because (1) I decided 
Arias at summary judgment, and (2) Arias is presently on appeal. But these 
distinctions ignore the key legal principle in Arias: after Egbert, an alternative 
remedial structure is “sufficient by itself” to preclude a Bivens claim. Arias, 2023 
WL 4204657, at *3. This principle is not only consistent with Egbert, it is also 
supported by the Tenth Circuit’s post-Egbert caselaw. See Noe, 2023 WL 8868491, 
at *3 (viewing the takeaway from Egbert “as being that courts may dispose of 

Bivens claims for two independent reasons” (internal quotation marks and brackets 
omitted)); Silva, 45 F.4th at 1141 (finding that the ARP “offers an independently 
sufficient ground to foreclose [the plaintiff’s] Bivens claim”).          
Further, the court’s determination that alternative remedies independently 
preclude a Bivens action is consistent with Egbert’s citation to Correctional Services 
Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61 (2001). In Malesko, the Supreme Court declined to 

extend Bivens relief to claims asserted against a BOP contractor. Malesko, 534 U.S. 
at 63. In Egbert, the Court discussed Malesko approvingly: “In Malesko, we 
explained that Bivens relief was unavailable because federal prisoners could, among 
other options, file grievances through an ‘Administrative Remedy Program.’” 
Egbert, 596 U.S. at 497 (quoting Malesko, 534 U.S. at 74). This is the same 
remedial structure that was available to Waltermeyer. The court, therefore, 
declines to abandon the approach it took in Arias.                        
The R&R contends that more factual development is necessary to determine 

whether alternative remedies were available to Waltermeyer. But Waltermeyer 
does not dispute that, while he was in the custody of the BOP, the ARP was 
available to him.1 Instead, Waltermeyer’s objection to defendants’ motion to dismiss 
argues that the court need not consider the availability of alternative remedies 
because his case is not a new Bivens context. However, as explained above, the 
Supreme Court’s recent jurisprudence calls on lower courts to consider alternative 
remedial structures when determining whether a Bivens claim presents a new 

context, and the availability of ARP places Waltermeyer’s claim in a context that 
differs from Carlson.                                                     
The R&R additionally asserts that, to the extent Waltermeyer had     
alternative remedies other than the ARP available, those remedies are insufficient 
to resolve his claims. This assertion, however, goes against Egbert: “the question 
whether a given remedy is adequate is a legislative determination that must be left 

to Congress, not the federal courts.” 596 U.S. at 498. Therefore, under Egbert, the 
court must not assess the sufficiency of the remedies available to Waltermeyer.  
The takeaway from the Supreme Court’s recent Bivens jurisprudence is that 
separation of powers principles call for judicial restraint. Those principles informed 

1 Waltermeyer’s original complaint, construed as part of his third amended 
complaint  in  the  R&R,  explicitly  states  that  Waltermeyer  “exhausted  his 
Administrative Remedy process.” Doc. no. 1 at 1.                          
my reasoning in Arias, and I am not persuaded by the Magistrate Judge’s attempt 
to distinguish it. 

                          CONCLUSION 
 For the aforementioned reasons, the court rejects the Magistrate Judge’s 
Report and Recommendation (doc. no. 38). The court grants defendants’ motion to 
dismiss (doc. no. 33). Accordingly, the clerk of court shall enter judgment and close 
the case.
