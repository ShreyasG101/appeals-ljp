outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Ana I. Escobar-Pabón, Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; Héctor Hernández-Morales, Warden; Commonwealth of Puerto Rico''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that Núñez''s federal habeas petition was untimely under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(C) because his Puerto Rico Rule 192.1 motion was filed eleven days after the one-year statute of limitations period following the Supreme Court''s decision in Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle had expired.

  2. Appellants contended that the District Court erred in granting equitable tolling to Núñez for the eleven-day delay in filing his Rule 192.1 motion, and thus his petition should be dismissed as time-barred.'
