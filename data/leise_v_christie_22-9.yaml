outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Kevin Christie and Bor Yang''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Christie and Yang argued that the district court erred in denying them federal qualified immunity as to Leise’s substantive due process claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, contending that releasing the Investigative Report did not violate clearly established law.

  2. Christie and Yang contended that the district court erred in denying them qualified immunity under Vermont state law as to Leise’s individual capacity claims for defamation and invasion of privacy, asserting that their actions were lawful and protected by state qualified immunity.


  === Andrew Leise''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. Leise argued that the district court erred by concluding that the Vermont Human Rights Commission (VHRC) is an arm of the State of Vermont and thus entitled to state sovereign immunity, contending that the VHRC is an independent entity and not protected by sovereign immunity.'
