reason_for_appeal: '=== Brandon Velez''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his wrongful-arrest claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and his state law false-imprisonment claim, contending that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in finding probable cause existed for his arrest, arguing that his actions did not constitute resisting arrest or detention under New Hampshire law because he was not given an opportunity to submit before force was used.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claim, asserting that he was arrested in retaliation for protesting the officer''s conduct and attempting to record the encounter.

  4. Appellant contended that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his Fourth Amendment excessive-force and common-law assault-and-battery claims, arguing that the force used by the officers, particularly Officer Slocum, was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.

  5. Appellant argued that the district court erred by not finding that the officers'' escalation of force, including multiple blows and tasing, constituted excessive force given the minor nature of the underlying offense and his lack of threat or flight risk.

  6. Appellant contended that the district court erred in granting qualified immunity to the officers, asserting that clearly established law put the officers on notice that their conduct was unconstitutional.

  7. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his municipal liability (Monell) claim, contending that the City of Manchester failed to adequately train its officers regarding the use of force and response to First Amendment-protected conduct.

  8. Appellant contended that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on his state-law failure-to-train claim, arguing that the City was negligent in training and supervising its officers, which led to his injuries.'
