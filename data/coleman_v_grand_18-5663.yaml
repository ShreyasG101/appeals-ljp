outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Steven Douglas Coleman''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Coleman argued that the district court erred in its application of New York law to his defamation claim.

  2. Coleman contended that the district court erroneously determined there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Grand acted with actual malice in making the statements in her letter.

  3. Coleman argued that the district court incorrectly concluded that the allegedly defamatory statements in Grand’s letter were non-actionable statements of opinion rather than fact.

  4. Coleman asserted that specific statements in Grand’s letter were provably false, including: (a) that Coleman ''convinced [her] to be intimate with him'' when she moved to New York in 2011; (b) that she was ''sexually harassed'' within a ''professional relationship''; (c) that the sexual harassment began in September 2013 when she ''wasn’t in love with him anymore'' and ''didn’t want to be intimate with him anymore''; and (d) that Coleman often ''call[ed] [her] in the middle of the night and [would] never take no for an answer.''

  5. Coleman further argued that Grand’s letter falsely insinuated that she was ''forced to go to [Coleman’s] hotel room'' during a 2011 trip to Chicago.'
