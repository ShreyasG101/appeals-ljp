outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Selim Zherka''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), which prohibits convicted felons from possessing firearms, is unconstitutional as applied to him because he was convicted only of a nonviolent financial felony and Congress cannot deprive him of his right to bear arms on that basis.

  2. Appellant contended that, because he has a constitutional right to bear arms, he also has a due process right under the Fifth Amendment to an individualized assessment of dangerousness before the government can deprive him of his Second Amendment rights.

  3. Appellant asserted that the district court erred by applying the pre-Bruen two-step test for Second Amendment challenges and argued that the case should be remanded for consideration under the standard announced in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen.

  4. Appellant alternatively claimed that the government failed to meet its burden under Bruen to demonstrate a history and tradition of firearms regulation in the United States that is analogous to Section 922(g)(1), specifically as applied to nonviolent felons.

  5. Appellant argued that, even if facially constitutional, Section 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to individuals convicted only of nonviolent felonies, and that the statute sweeps too broadly by not providing an exception or individualized process for such persons.'
