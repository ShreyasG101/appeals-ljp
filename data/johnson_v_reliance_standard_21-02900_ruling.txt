                              OPINION AND ORDER

        This matter is before the Court on Plaintiff Cheriese D. Johnson’s Motion for

Judgment on the Administrative Record [ECF 26] and Defendant Reliance

Standard Life Insurance Co.’s (Reliance Standard) Motion for Summary Judgment

[ECF 27]. On consideration of the parties’ briefing, and with the benefit of oral

argument, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion and GRANTS Reliance

Standard’s.

I.      Factual Background

        Unless otherwise noted, the facts are either undisputed by the parties or

taken from materials contained in the administrative record.1 Johnson was

employed at The William Carter Company.2 She became eligible for coverage

under its long-term disability insurance plan (the Plan) on October 12, 2016.3 The

Plan was issued by Reliance Standard and is governed by ERISA.4 Johnson would

eventually become totally disabled within the meaning of the Plan and seek long-

term disability benefits, which were denied by Reliance Standard.5

      The Plan contains a pre-existing conditions exclusion (the Exclusion):

              Benefits will not be paid for a Total Disability:

              (1) caused by;

              (2) contributed to by; or

              (3) resulting from;

              a Pre-existing Condition unless the Insured has been
              Actively at Work for one (1) full day following the end of
              twelve (12) consecutive months from the date he/she
              became an Insured.6

“Pre-existing Condition” is defined as “any Sickness or Injury for which the

Insured received medical Treatment, consultation, care or services, including

diagnostic procedures, or took prescribed drugs or medicines, during the three (3)

months immediately prior to the Insured’s effective date of insurance.”7

“Sickness,” in relevant part, “means illness or disease causing Total Disability

which begins while insurance coverage is in effect for the Insured.”8 The three-

month period is referred to as the “Look-Back Period.”9

       On December 31, 2015, Johnson first noticed the symptoms that would

ultimately lead her to stop working.10 Although Johnson was seen numerous times

by multiple professionals for her symptoms, the Court summarizes only some of

those visits. On August 15, 2016, Johnson was evaluated by a medical professional

for fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting.11 She underwent an upper

gastrointestinal endoscopy on August 23.12 On September 6, Johnson was

evaluated by a doctor who noted her complaints of nausea/vomiting, nose bleeds,

memory loss, body aches, and joint swelling.13 On September 13, Johnson was seen

by a doctor for low blood sugar; the day before that she had been seen for a

“syncopal episode.”14 Treatment notes from September 30 identify Johnson’s

symptoms as “vomiting, skin rash, chest pain, headaches, forgetfulness and

cognitive impairment, fatigue, inability to control bowels, blurred visions, fever,

low blood sugar (54), nausea, loss of appetite, syncope, dizziness, generalized

aching, swelling of feet and hands, loss of motor skills and nosebleeds.”15 From

July 25 through October 3, 2016, Johnson was prescribed a variety of medications

to treat her symptoms.16 In February 2017, Johnson had a lung resection surgery

and was finally diagnosed with scleroderma.17 Scleroderma is a rare, chronic

autoimmune disease “in which normal tissue is replaced with dense, thick fibrous

tissue.” Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness, persistent cough, shortness of

breath, digestive and gastrointestinal problems, and fatigue.18

       On October 3, 2017, Johnson filed a claim for long-term disability benefits.19

The parties do not dispute that Johnson has a Total Disability within the meaning

of the Plan.20 Her claim form indicates that she became unable to work as of

January 26, 2017.21 One of her treating physicians identified her symptoms for

purposes of her claim as joint pain, swelling, and shortness of breath.22

       Because Johnson sought benefits within 12 months of first becoming insured

under the Plan, her claim was subject to evaluation under the Exclusion.23 The

applicable Look-Back Period under the Exclusion was from July 12, 2016 through

October 12, 2016.24 Despite having been seen by and received treatment from many

doctors and been prescribed numerous medications during this period, Johnson

was not diagnosed with scleroderma until after her lung resection surgery in

February 2017. This is the crux of the parties’ dispute.

       Reliance Standard denied Johnson’s claim on January 4, 2018, and indicated

that, at the time she stopped working, she was suffering from “pain and numbness

involving all fo[u]r extremities, joint swelling, motor loss, cough, and cognitive

impairment.”25 Johnson appealed, asserting that she was not diagnosed with

scleroderma until after the Look-Back Period. As a result, she argued that the

Exclusion did not apply.26 In response, Reliance Standard engaged an

endocrinologist, Dr. Robert Cooper, to review Johnson’s medical file.27 Dr. Cooper

concluded that Johnson had received various treatment during the Look-Back

Period.28 On July 18, 2018, Reliance Standard upheld the denial of Johnson’s claim

for benefits, concluding that her disability was “caused by, contributed to by, or

the result of a pre-existing condition.”29

II.     Applicable Legal Standard

        The procedural vehicle for resolving motions for judgment based on the

administrative record is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(1), which states:

“[i]n an action tried on the facts without a jury . . . the court must find the facts

specially and state its conclusions of law separately. The findings and conclusions

may be stated on the record after the close of the evidence or may appear in an

opinion or a memorandum of decision filed by the court.” Presenting findings and

conclusions in a written order “has been accepted as the preferable practice” by

this Court. Garlington v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 2012 WL 7589403, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Dec.

31, 2012). In contrast, summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine

dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter

of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In determining whether a genuine issue of material

fact exists, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing

summary judgment, “and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn” in favor of that

party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986); see also Herzog v. Castle

Rock Entm’t, 193 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir. 1999). Because the parties largely agree

on the facts and do not contest the accuracy of the administrative record, the

difference between these two standards does not substantially affect the Court’s

analysis here.

III.   Discussion

       In short, the parties disagree about whether Johnson’s treatment for a

variety of symptoms during the Look-Back Period—without a diagnosis of the

cause of those symptoms—makes her claim for benefits subject to the Exclusion.

The parties do not dispute that scleroderma is a Sickness (an illness or disease

causing Total Disability). They do dispute whether it is a Sickness “for which”

Johnson received medical Treatment, consultation, care, or services during the

Look-Back Period. Johnson contends that she could not have received treatment

for a disease no one knew she had. Rather, Johnson argues that she was only
        Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 8 of 16




treated for a litany of symptoms that are associated with numerous illnesses and

diseases.30

       In evaluating the denial of benefits under ERISA, this Court must apply the

comprehensive framework developed by the Eleventh Circuit for reviewing an

administrator’s determination:

              1. Apply the de novo standard to determine whether the
                 claim administrator’s benefits-denial decision is
                 “wrong” (i.e., the court disagrees with the
                 administrator’s decision); if it is not, then end the
                 inquiry and affirm the decision.

              2. If the administrator’s decision in fact is “de novo
                 wrong,” then determine whether he was vested with
                 discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial
                 inquiry and reverse the decision.

              3. If the administrator’s decision is “de novo wrong” and
                 he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims,
                 then determine whether “reasonable” grounds
                 supported it (hence, review his decision under the
                 more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).

              4. If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the inquiry
                 and reverse the administrator’s decision; if
                 reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he
                 operated under a conflict of interest.

              5. If there is no conflict, then end the inquiry and affirm
                 the decision.

              6. If there is a conflict, the conflict should merely be a
                 factor for the court to take into account when



30   ECF 26-1, at 10–16.
        Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 9 of 16




                    determining whether an administrator’s decision
                    was arbitrary and capricious.

Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 644 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir. 2011). Where an

exclusion is at issue, the insurer bears the burden of establishing that the exclusion

prevents coverage. Horton v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 141 F.3d 1038, 1040

(11th Cir. 1998).

       The parties have not argued steps one or two of this test. Accordingly, the

Court begins with step three. Ferrizzi v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 792 F. App’x

678, 684 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (“Because the parties have briefed only the

arbitrary and capricious issues involving steps three through six, and because the

magistrate judge and the district court addressed only those issues, we will also

pretermit the de novo review of steps one and two and begin with the “arbitrary

and capricious” standard of steps three through six, considering the structural

conflict as a factor.”).

       A.     Step Three: Was Reliance Standard’s decision reasonable?

       Since the analysis begins with step three, the Court assumes without

deciding that Reliance Standard’s decision to deny benefits to Johnson was de novo

wrong.31 When conducting a review of an ERISA benefits denial under the




31   The Court is not convinced that any part of the Blankenship analysis beyond
     step one was required here. But the parties started their arguments with step
     three, so that is where the Court begins as well.
       Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 10 of 16




arbitrary and capricious standard, the Court’s function is to determine “whether

there was a reasonable basis for the decision, based upon the facts as known to the

administrator at the time the decision was made.” Graham v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,

222 F. Supp. 3d 1129, 1137–38 (N.D. Ga. 2016). The Court limits its review to

whether the benefits determination “was made rationally and in good faith—not

whether it was right.” Griffis v. Delta Family–Care Disability, 723 F.2d 822, 825 (11th

Cir. 1984).

      Whether Johnson was entitled to benefits depends on the meaning of the

Exclusion—a legal question. Ferrizzi, 792 F. App’x at 684 (“We first look to the plain

and ordinary meaning of the policy terms to interpret the contract.”) (quoting

Alexandra H. v. Oxford Health Ins. Inc. Freedom Access Plan, 833 F.3d 1299, 1307

(11th Cir. 2016)). Although it is an unreported decision, the Eleventh Circuit

addressed the exact contract language at issue here in Ferrizzi. As Johnson now

does, Ferrizzi argued that the pre-existing condition exclusion could not apply

because he had not been diagnosed or treated for the disabling condition during

the look-back period. The Court of Appeals squarely rejected this argument:

              [T]he policy’s own definition of a “pre-existing
              condition” does not require a specific diagnosis or a
              specifically timed diagnosis of a condition for the
              exclusion to apply. Under the policy, if Ferrizzi received
              “treatment, consultation, care or services, including
              diagnostic procedures, or took prescribed drugs or
              medicines” for “any Sickness or Injury” that caused,
              contributed to, or resulted in his “total disability” from
        Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 11 of 16




              substance abuse/drug dependence, then the policy
              excludes coverage. The Reliance policy exclusion does
              not require a formal diagnosis during the lookback
              period, and Ferrizzi’s arguments to the contrary are
              unpersuasive.

Id. at 685.

       Applying standard contract interpretation rules, as the Court of Appeals did

in Ferrizzi, leads this Court to the inescapable conclusion that Reliance Standard’s

benefits determination was supported by reasonable grounds. The Exclusion does

not require that a diagnosis have been made for it to apply; it only required that

Johnson have been treated or received consultation during the Look-Back Period

for the Sickness that caused her total disability. Johnson plainly received

treatment, consulted with physicians, and was prescribed medication for her

ailments during the Look-Back Period.32

       Johnson attempts to distinguish Ferrizzi, claiming that it does not address

cases that held a pre-existing condition exclusion cannot apply to an undiagnosed

condition.33 Those cases, however, are from a smattering of other state and federal

courts and are not persuasive in light of the unambiguous language of the




32   The Court assumes without deciding that Reliance Standard bears the burden
     to show its application of the Exclusion was reasonable. Compare ECF 26-1, at
     8–9 and ECF 35, at 1–2 with ECF 29, at 4–7. Reliance Standard has more than
     satisfied that standard.

        Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 12 of 16




Exclusion and the Eleventh Circuit’s interpretation of the exact same exclusion

language.34

       The primary case from the Eleventh Circuit on which Johnson relies,

Horneland v. United of Omaha Insurance Company, is not as helpful to her position as

she suggests. Horneland involved a pre-existing conditions exclusion with

language very similar to the one here. But it defined “[s]ickness” more narrowly—

as a “disease, disorder or condition, including pregnancy, for which you are under

the care of a Physician.” 717 F. App’x 846, 847 (11th Cir. 2017) (per curiam). (Here,

“Sickness” is an illness or disease causing Total Disability.) Horneland’s benefits

claim was denied because the insurer concluded he was not disabled; but the

insurer also determined that, even if he was disabled, the pre-existing exclusion

applied because Horneland had been treated for “muscle spasms” and “back

pain” during the look-back period.

       The Court of Appeals noted that Horneland’s symptoms were not “by

themselves necessarily Pre-Existing Conditions under the Exclusion,” or a

“disease, disorder, or condition.” Id. at 855. Further, the plan defined pain as a




34   ECF 32, at 11 (relying on Ermenc v. American Family Mutual Ins. Co., 585 N.W.2d
     679, 682 (Wis. 1998); Hall v. Continental Cas. Co., 207 F. Supp. 2d 903, 912 (W.D.
     Wis. 2002); McLeod v. Hartford, 372 F.3d 618, 626 (3d Cir. 2004); Ceccanecchio v.
     Continental Cas. Co., 50 F. App’x 66, 72 (3d Cir. 2002); App v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.,
     2009 WL 2475020, at *8 (M.D. Pa. 2009)).
       Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 13 of 16




symptom, not a condition. Id. But the court also found that the underlying cause

of Horneland’s back pain and muscle spasms could trigger the pre-existing

condition exclusion. Id. at 856. Factual disputes prevented resolution of that issue.

The Court of Appeals therefore concluded that there were material disputes about

the disability, the pre-existing condition, and whether the pre-existing condition

caused the disability.

      None of that is in dispute here. The parties agree that scleroderma rendered

Johnson disabled. The problems for which she received medication and medical

treatment during the Look-Back Period were all attributable to scleroderma—even

though she had not yet been diagnosed with it. Moreover, the problems for which

Johnson was treated during the Look-Back Period certainly fall within the

definition of “illness,” which makes them a Sickness under the Plan. Illness was

not a term used in the policy at issue in Horneland. Johnson’s characterization of

that case as standing for the proposition that a person cannot receive treatment for

a Sickness that has not yet been diagnosed does not accurately reflect the

conclusions reached by the Court of Appeals. At a minimum, Ferrizzi and

Horneland demonstrate that it was not unreasonable for Reliance Standard to

conclude Johnson had been treated during the Look-Back Period for the Sickness

that caused her Total Disability.
        Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 14 of 16




       B.     Steps Four and Five: Conflict of Interest

       The parties agree that Reliance Standard operated under a structural conflict

of interest.35 Therefore, the Court proceeds to Step Six.

       C.     Step Six: Was Reliance Standard’s decision arbitrary and
              capricious?

       Johnson bears the ultimate burden of showing that the benefits denial was

arbitrary and capricious. Ferrizzi, 792 F. App’x at 684 (where “there is a conflict of

interest, ‘the burden remains on the plaintiff to show the decision was arbitrary; it

is not the defendant’s burden to prove its decision was not tainted by self-

interest.’”) (quoting Doyle v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Boston, 542 F.3d 1352, 1360

(11th Cir. 2008)). In this effort Johnson points towards Reliance Standard’s

engagement of Dr. Cooper and argues in conclusory fashion that, since Dr. Cooper

was an endocrinologist, and since scleroderma is a rare rheumatological condition

that is difficult to diagnose, Dr. Cooper was not sufficiently qualified to render his

opinion.36

       But simply questioning Dr. Cooper’s qualifications without evidence is

unavailing. Johnson is the one who needed to establish that Dr. Cooper was not




35   ECF 27-1, at 11; ECF 38 (during oral argument, counsel for both sides agreed
     that Reliance Standard was conflicted).
36   ECF 26-1, at 18; ECF 35, at 14-15.
            Case 1:21-cv-02900-SDG Document 40 Filed 09/29/23 Page 15 of 16




qualified to render his opinion. Her contention that Dr. Cooper’s resumé does not

“indicate familiarity with rare rheumatological disorders”37 is not enough.

            Finally, Johnson argues that Reliance Standard’s decision was tainted by the

conflict because the denial letters do not mention scleroderma.38 Given the

Exclusion’s reliance on Treatment—rather than diagnosis—during the Look-Back

Period, this is weak evidence at best that Reliance Standard “did not undertake a

deliberate and principled reasoning process.”

            Even taking all of Johnson’s arguments together, Reliance Standard’s

decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious when it was entirely consistent with

an Eleventh Circuit case interpreting the exact same policy language. The Court

empathizes with Johnson’s situation. She suffers from a disabling and extremely

painful terminal condition. But Johnson’s genuine need for coverage cannot

render meaningless the legal standards the Court must apply. Johnson has not

demonstrated that Reliance Standard’s decision to deny her benefits was arbitrary

and capricious.
