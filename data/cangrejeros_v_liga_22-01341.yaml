outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Cangrejeros de Santurce Baseball Club, LLC; Santurce Merchandising LLC; Thomas J. Axon (Plaintiffs)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Sherman Act claims because the ''business of baseball'' exemption applies only to Major League Baseball (MLB) and its affiliates, not to the Puerto Rico professional baseball league.

  2. Plaintiffs contended in the alternative that, even if the exemption could apply to the League, the specific conduct alleged (the alleged conspiracy to oust Axon and seize the franchise) was not ''central'' to the business of baseball and thus fell outside the scope of the exemption.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Puerto Rico antitrust and fair competition law claims on the ground that those claims were preempted by the Supremacy Clause due to the ''business of baseball'' exemption.

  4. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in dismissing their 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim on res judicata grounds, asserting that there was not perfect identity of parties or causes of action between the prior state court action and the present federal action.

  5. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in dismissing their remaining Puerto Rico law claim (a contract/tort claim) for lack of supplemental jurisdiction, because a federal claim remained viable.'
