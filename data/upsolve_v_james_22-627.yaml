outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Letitia James, in her official capacity as Attorney General of New York''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in concluding that Plaintiffs had standing to challenge the application of New York’s unauthorized practice of law (UPL) statutes, contending that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the existence of any client to whom they anticipated providing unlicensed legal counsel and thus lacked a credible threat of prosecution.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in holding that New York’s UPL statutes, as applied to Plaintiffs, constitute a content-based regulation of speech subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment.

  3. Appellant argued that the UPL statutes regulate professional conduct, not speech, and that any burden on speech is incidental, so the statutes should not be subject to heightened First Amendment scrutiny.

  4. Appellant asserted that, even if the UPL statutes regulate speech, the regulation is content-neutral and should be subject only to intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny.'
