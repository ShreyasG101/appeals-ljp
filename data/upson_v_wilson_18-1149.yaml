outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Jamel Upson''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Defendants Wilson and White by finding that he failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact as to whether they knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to his health or safety in violation of the Eighth Amendment.

  2. Appellant contended that there were factual disputes regarding whether Wilson and White were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs when they allegedly refused to evaluate or treat his bowel obstruction while he was confined at Upstate Correctional Facility.'
