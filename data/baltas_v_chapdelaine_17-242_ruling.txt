                      RULING AND ORDER                                  

   In 2017, inmates in the custody of the Connecticut                   
Department of Correction (“DOC”) at MacDougall-Walker                     
Correctional Institution (“MWCI”) brought this action under               
42 U.S.C. § 1983 against DOC officials in their individual                
and official capacities seeking damages and injunctive                    
relief based on alleged violations of their rights under                  
federal and state law arising from their confinement in Q-                
Pod, a housing unit at MWCI.  Named as defendants were the                
officials responsible for the operation of Q-Pod at the                   
time: Carol Chapdelaine, who served as Warden of MWCI;                    
Guilianna Mudano, who served as Deputy Warden; and Angel                  

Quiros, who served as DOC’s District Administrator.                       
   Plaintiffs alleged that Q-Pod, although nominally a                  
general population housing unit, actually functioned as an                
administrative detention unit.  Plaintiffs alleged that                   
while in Q-Pod, they were denied privileges in                            

contravention of DOC Administrative Directives (“DOC                      
A.D.”), specifically, DOC A.D. 9.4, which authorizes                      
various types of restrictive housing units, and DOC A.D.                  
9.5, which governs the disciplinary process.  They further                
alleged that they were housed in Q-Pod for up to a year or                
more at the “whim” of prison officials without the benefit                

of procedural safeguards.  Plaintiffs claimed that as a                   
result of their confinement in Q-Pod, each of them had been               
deprived of certain constitutional rights, with the                       
knowledge and approval of the defendants, specifically: (1)               
the Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and                      
unusual punishment; (2) the Fourteenth Amendment right to                 

due process of law; (3) the First Amendment right to access               
the courts; and (4) the First Amendment right to the free                 
exercise of religion.1  In addition, the complaint alleged                
violations of the Connecticut Constitution and state                      

statutes.                                                                 
   The defendants denied the allegations of the amended                 
complaint and pleaded defenses of qualified immunity and                  
mootness.  Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed                  
and argued and the case has been effectively stayed pending               

a ruling on the motions.                                                  
   The defendants seek summary judgment on all the                      
federal causes of action in the amended complaint.  They                  
argue that the admissible evidence in the record would not                
permit a jury to find in favor of any of the plaintiffs on                
any of those causes of action.  They further argue that, at               

a minimum, they are protected by qualified immunity under §               
1983.  Finally, they argue that the claims for injunctive                 
relief are moot.  I conclude that to the extent any of the                
plaintiffs may have a viable claim under § 1983, qualified                
immunity applies.  I also conclude that the claims for                    
injunctive relief are moot.  Accordingly, the defendants’                 


1 Plaintiffs also invoke the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  In             
substance, the Fourth Amendment claim is duplicative of the               
Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim, so it is not           
discussed separately in the text.  The Fifth Amendment claim is           
not discussed because it does not apply to the matters at issue.          
motion is granted with regard to the federal claims,                      
plaintiffs’ motion is denied, and the state law claims are                

dismissed without prejudice.                                              
I.     Background                                                       
   Based on the summary judgment record, the following                  
matters appear to be undisputed.  MWCI is a high security,                
level 4/5 facility.  It provides a highly structured                      

environment for long-term sentenced offenders, protective                 
custody offenders, and high bond unsentenced offenders.  At               
the pertinent time, it had a population of approximately                  
1900 inmates.                                                             
   Q-Pod is a housing unit located in the MacDougall wing               
of MWCI.  Established in 2003, it has been used to house                  

inmates who are transitioning from more restrictive                       
conditions of confinement, such as punitive segregation,                  
back to general population.  Q-Pod has been the subject of                
prior cases brought by inmates under § 1983.  See, e.g.,                  
Galarza v. Erfe, No. 3:18-cv-663(JAM), 2019 WL 8756874 (D.                
Conn. April 30, 2019)(denying Q-Pod inmate’s motion to                    

reopen action under § 1983 for failure to show plausible                  
grounds for relief for any constitutional claim); Harnage                 
v. Brighthaupt, No. 3:12-cv-1521, Ruling On Motion to                     
Dismiss In Part, ECF 42 (D. Conn. Feb. 12, 2014)(dismissing               
Q-Pod inmate’s Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement                 

claim and Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process                     
claim);  Shakur v. Sieminski, 3:07-cv-1239(CFD), 2009 WL                  
2151174 (D. Conn. July 15, 2009)(dismissing Q-Pod inmate’s                
Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim).2                       
   There are 60 cells in Q-Pod, each one designed for two               

people.  The cells are divided for administrative purposes                
into 4 groups of 15 cells each.  This arrangement enables                 
prison officials to separate inmates for safety and                       
security reasons by placing them in different groups.  Each               
cell throughout the unit has a toilet with a timer that                   
limits the number of consecutive flushes.3  The unit has a                

medical assessment room.  The outdoor recreation yard                     
attached to the unit includes a full-length basketball                    
court.  There is no television.                                           


2 Shakur provides a detailed description of Q-Pod, which at the           
time was called “Q-Unit.”                                                 
3 While the exact intervals on the timer are in dispute, the              
official notice sent to inmates when the timers were installed            
reads as follows: “Be advised you can flush the toilet two times          
in five minutes.  You must wait five minutes before flushing              
again.  If you try to flush a third time before the ten minute            
period the toilet will lockout for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes          
the cycle will reset to normal operation.”  ECF 61-1 at 12.               
   Inmates in Q-Pod are generally housed with a cellmate                
and permitted daily visitation.  Meals are provided to                    

inmates in their cells.4  Inmates recreate in the outdoor                 
recreation yard 15 cells at a time (i.e. 30 inmates per                   
session).  When the plaintiffs were housed in Q-Pod, they                 
were not given access to group religious services with the                
general population, although that has since changed.                      

   Q-Pod inmates have fewer privileges than general                     
population inmates.  Authority for this disparity in                      
privileges is unclear, but may be found in DOC A.D. 9.4.6,                
which provides that “[a]n inmate on restrictive housing                   
status shall not be entitled to access to programs or                     
privileges afforded an inmate in general population.”  In                 

any event, the stated purpose of the disparity in                         
privileges is to motivate inmates to work their way out of                
Q-Pod by complying with prison rules and regulations.                     
“Correctional experience has demonstrated that it is an                   
effective correctional tool to disincentivize inmates from                


4 The parties disagree as to why inmates in Q-Pod are fed in              
their cells.  Defendants argue that this policy arises from the           
need to separate inmates due to safety and security concerns.             
Plaintiffs claim that there were no separation issues while they          
were housed in Q-Pod and that defendants conflate security                
issues in the MacDougall and Walker wings of MCWI.                        
getting tickets or disciplinary reports.”  See Plfs’ Local

Local Rule 56(a)(1) Statement, ECF 56-2, at 2 ¶9.5                        
   The following matters are disputed.  Plaintiffs allege               
that when they were in Q-Pod, medical and mental health                   
services were provided only within the unit itself (if at                 
all), rather than in the main building, where general                     

population inmates receive services.  Defendants state that               
like general population inmates, Q-Pod inmates go to the                  
main building for medical and mental health services; the                 
medical assessment room in Q-Pod is available for use in                  
emergencies.  Plaintiffs further allege that when they were               
in Q-Pod, inmates were allowed to go to the library in the                

main building just once a month, in contrast to general                   
population inmates, who could go once a week.  Defendants                 
state that Q-Pod inmates were able to access the library                  
every other week if they signed up in advance.                            
   Toilet-related issues are also disputed.  Defendants                 


5 In 2004, soon after Q-Pod opened, the U.S. Department of                
Justice, National Institute of Corrections, issued a report               
commending DOC’s “Close Custody Phase Program” at MWCI.  See              
Classification of High-Risk and Special Management Prisoners, A           
National Assessment of Current Practices, at 51, available at             
http://www.nicic.org.                                                     
say that toilets all over MWCI have timers due to an                      
agreement with the Town of Suffield related to water usage;               

plaintiffs say that toilets in other parts of the facility                
did not have timers when they were in Q-Pod.  Plaintiffs                  
also allege that Q-Pod was the only unit where DOC staff                  
could shut off inmates’ water and that some (unidentified)                
correctional Officers sometimes shut off inmates’ water for               

hours.                                                                    
 Finally, the parties dispute what determined the amount                
of time plaintiffs stayed in Q-Pod.  Defendants state that                
the duration of a plaintiff’s stay depended on the                        
disciplinary ticket he received: a ticket for a Class A                   
violation resulted in a stay of 90 days; a Class B ticket                 

resulted in a stay of 60 days.  Plaintiffs say the duration               
was always longer than 90 days.  Defendants counter that                  
new violations of prison rules reset the clock for a                      
plaintiff’s stay in Q-Pod, as prison officials noted in                   
response to one of plaintiff Baltas’s grievances.  See Pl.

   “Summary judgment is proper only when, construing the                
evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant,                   
‘there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and                  
the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’”

(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).  “A genuine issue of                     
material fact exists if ‘the evidence is such that a

may be granted “against a party who fails to make a showing               
sufficient to establish the existence of an element                       
essential to that party’s case, and on which that party                   
will bear the burden of proof at trial.”  Celotex Corp. v.

   The non-moving party may defeat summary judgment by                  
pointing to a genuine dispute of material fact but may not                
do so through conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated                     
speculation, or inadmissible evidence.  See F.D.I.C. v.                   
Great Am. Ins. Co., 607 F.3d 288, 292 (2d Cir. 2010).  “The               

mere verification by affidavit of one’s own conclusory                    
allegations is not sufficient to oppose a motion for                      
summary judgment.”  Zigmund v. Foster, 106 F. Supp. 2d 352,

(quoting D’Amico v. City of N.Y., 132 F.3d 145, 149 (2d

insufficient.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.

   A.  Eighth Amendment                                                 
   Plaintiffs claim that their rights under the Eighth                  

Amendment were violated as a result of their placement in                 
Q-Pod in that they were: (1) denied group meals, group                    
exercise and other group activities providing opportunities               
to socialize; (2) denied vocational training, job                         
assignments, and education; (3) deprived of adequate                      
medical care; (4) deprived of court-ordered drug and                      

alcohol counseling; and (5) deprived of access to toilets                 
without timers.                                                           
   The Eighth Amendment is concerned with “[a prisoner’s]               
basic human needs — e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical                
care, and reasonable safety.”  DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty.                

Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 200 (1989).  “[A]                     
prison official violates the Eighth Amendment only when” he               
or she causes a deprivation that is “sufficiently serious.”               
Salahuddin v. Goord, 467 F.3d 263, 279 (2d Cir. 2006)                     
(quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994)).                    

“Only ‘deprivations “denying the minimal civilized measure                
of life’s necessities” are sufficiently grave to form the                 
basis of an Eighth Amendment violation.’”  Id. (quoting                   
Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991)).                              
   In accordance with these principles, plaintiffs’ Eighth              
Amendment claim requires that they prove (1) an                           

“objectively, sufficiently serious . . . denial of the                    
minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities” and (2) a                
“sufficiently culpable state of mind” on the part of the                  
responsible official.  Willey v. Kirkpatrick, 801 F.3d 51,                
66 (2d Cir. 2015).  The deprivations at issue here do not                 
meet the first prong.  See Galarza v. Erfe, 2019 WL                       

8756874, *3 (Q-Pod inmate’s allegations of no communal                    
meals, 45-minute limit on recreation time, non-availability               
of programs outside of cell, and correctional officers’                   
loud walkie-talkies disrupting sleep failed to meet first                 
prong); Shakur, 2009 WL 2151174, *6 (rejecting claim that                 

restrictive conditions in Q-Pod constituted cruel and                     
unusual punishment).                                                      
   At oral argument, plaintiff’s counsel explained that                 
plaintiffs’ lack of access to group meals, group exercise                 
and other group activities while in Q-Pod resulted in a                   

form of debilitating isolation.  “Confinement . . . in an                 
isolation cell is a form of punishment subject to scrutiny                
under Eighth Amendment standards.”  Hutto v. Finney, 437                  
U.S. 678, 685 (1978).  But plaintiffs do not allege that                  
any of them was held in isolation.  Rather, each plaintiff                
had a cellmate, was permitted daily visits and could                      

recreate up to two hours a day with many others.  Given                   
this level of social contact, plaintiffs’ lack of access to               
group meals, group exercise and other group activities did                
not impose a level of isolation sufficient to support a                   
constitutional claim.  Cf. Tavares v. Amato, 954 F. Supp.                 
2d 79, 92 (N.D.N.Y. 2013) (noting that administrative                     

segregation conditions are generally insufficient to                      
establish Eighth Amendment violations).                                   
   Deliberate indifference by prison officials to a                     
prisoner’s serious medical or mental health needs                         
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.  See Slavone v.                 

New York State Dep’t of Corr. Servs., 719 F.3d 127, 138 (2d               
Cir. 2013).  However, “not every lapse in medical care is a               
constitutional wrong.”  Salahuddin, 467 F.3d at 279.  To                  
prevail on a claim of deliberate indifference in violation                
of the Eighth Amendment, an inmate must demonstrate (1)                   

that his need for medical care was objectively,                           
sufficiently serious, and (2) that the defendant failed to                
provide necessary care despite being aware of a substantial               
risk that the inmate would suffer serious harm as a result.               
Plaintiffs do not specifically allege (or offer evidence to               
prove) any instance in which any of them was denied access                

to needed medical or mental health care.  Rather, they                    
state that “many times the offender would be denied medical               
treatment” and that with regard to mental health treatment,               
“[t]here was not any confidentiality.”  ECF 69 ¶ 36.  These               
allegations are insufficient to support a claim of                        
deliberate indifference.                                                  

   The absence of specific allegations of harm (and lack                
of supporting evidence), also undercuts the Eighth                        
Amendment claim insofar as it is based on denial of access                
to drug and alcohol counseling.  Plaintiff Rivera claimed                 
in an inmate request form that he needed to be in a drug                  

treatment program to become eligible for parole but was                   
being denied entry into the program because he was in Q-                  
Pod.  Pl. Ex., ECF 47-4, at 20.  DOC’s response to Rivera’s               
grievance indicates that he was barred from the program                   
because of his disciplinary report rather than by his                     

housing status per se.  Id.  Delayed eligibility for parole               
is not a deprivation of basic human needs and does not                    
violate the Eighth Amendment.                                             
   Plaintiffs’ allegation regarding toilet timers does not              
support an Eighth Amendment claim.  Temporary deprivations                
of toilet use that do not result in serious physical harm                 

or contamination do not rise to the level of a                            
constitutional violation.  Harvin v. Chapdelaine, No. 3:16-               
CV-1616(VAB), 2017 WL 3725611, at *11 (D. Conn. Aug. 29,                  
2017) (collecting cases).                                                 
   Finally, plaintiffs’ lack of access to jobs,                         
educational programs and vocational training while in Q-Pod               

does not support an Eighth Amendment claim.  See Galarza v.               
Erfe, 2019 WL 8756874, *3 (non-availability of programs in                
Q-Pod did not provide plausible ground for Eighth Amendment               
claim).                                                                   
   Defendants argue that even assuming an Eighth                        

Amendment violation could be found on the basis of the                    
record here, they are entitled to qualified immunity.  I                  
agree.                                                                    
   Qualified immunity shields government officials from                 
claims for damages under § 1983 “insofar as their conduct                 

does not violate clearly established statutory or                         
constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would                  
have known.”  Farid v. Ellen, 593 F.3d 233, 244 (2d Cir.                  
2010) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818                    
(1982) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  To overcome a                
defense of qualified immunity, a plaintiff must show that                 

(1) the defendant violated a constitutional right, and (2)                
the right at issue was clearly established at the time of                 
the defendant’s conduct.  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S.                   
223, 232 (2009).  “A clearly established right is one that                
is ‘sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would               
have understood that what he is doing violates that                       

right.’”  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 11 (2015) (quoting                
Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.S. 658, 664 (2012)).  To                        
determine whether a right was clearly established, courts                 
in this circuit consider “Supreme Court decisions, [Second                
Circuit] decisions, and decisions from other circuit                      

courts.”  Simon v. City of New York, 893 F.3d 83, 92 (2d                  
Cir. 2018).  “A right must be defined with reasonable                     
specificity and is clearly established only if the relevant               
case authority is directly on point or clearly foreshadows                
a ruling recognizing the right.”  Galarza v. Erfe, No.                    

3:18-cv-663 (JAM), 2020 WL 5501239, *4 (D. Conn. Sept. 11,                
2020), citing Sloley v. VanBramer, 845 F.3d 30, 40 (2d Cir.               
2019).                                                                    
    Plaintiffs have not identified relevant case authority              
showing that the restrictive conditions they experienced in               
Q-Pod violated the Eighth Amendment.  They cite no decision               

of the Supreme Court, Second Circuit or other circuit                     
courts suggesting that the conditions were objectively,                   
sufficiently serious to rise to the level of cruel and                    
unusual punishment.  Moreover, the decision in Shakur                     
rejecting the plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim gave the                 
defendants reason to believe that the conditions of                       

confinement in Q-Pod did not violate the Eighth Amendment.                
See also Galarza v. Erfe, No. 3:18-CV-00663 (JAM), 2019 WL                
8756874, *3 (D. Conn. Apr. 30, 2019) (inmate’s allegations                
concerning conditions of confinement in Q-Pod failed to                   
provide plausible ground for Eighth Amendment claim).                     
   B.  Fourteenth Amendment                                             

         i.  Procedural Due Process                                     

  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment                    
protects inmates against deprivation of certain liberty                   
interests without procedural safeguards.  A prisoner has a                
right to procedural protection when (1) the state has                     
created a liberty interest in a statute or regulation and                 
(2) deprivation of that interest results in “atypical and                 
significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents                
of prison life.”  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484                     

(1995).6  Accordingly, to prevail here, plaintiffs must                   
establish both that their confinement in Q-Pod imposed an                 
atypical and significant hardship under Sandin, and that                  
the state granted them, by regulation or statute, a                       
protected liberty interest in remaining free from                         


6 Sandin involved an inmate, Demont Connor, who was confined in           
disciplinary segregation for 30 days.  During his 30 days in              
disciplinary segregation, Connor was confined to his cell except          
for 50 minutes each day when he was permitted to exercise and             
shower while isolated from other inmates and constrained by leg           
irons and waist chains.  The Court concluded that Conner’s                
confinement in disciplinary segregation for 30 days did not               
impose “atypical and significant hardship.”                               
confinement in Q-Pod.  See Frazier v. Coughlin, 81 F.3d                   
313, 317 (2d Cir. 1996).                                                  

   The record is insufficient to permit a reasoned                      
determination of whether plaintiffs can prove a state-                    
created liberty interest.  They point to DOC A.D 9.5, which               
sets out the available penalties for disciplinary                         
violations.  See ECF 60.  They contend that this regulation               

gives prisoners a liberty interest in being free from                     
penalties that are not expressly authorized.  Defendants                  
have not addressed this contention directly.  See ECF 56-1                
at 21-22.  But they do deny that the conditions in Q-Pod                  
imposed a penalty.  Though the record is insufficient to                  
permit a reasoned finding, I will assume for present                      

purposes that plaintiffs can prove they had a state-created               
liberty interest in avoiding assignment to Q-Pod.                         
   Whether plaintiffs can prove that the conditions in Q-               
Pod imposed atypical and significant hardship is also                     
unclear.  The inquiry hinges on two factors: the duration                 
of the plaintiff’s confinement in Q-Pod and the extent to                 

which the conditions in Q-Pod differed from the conditions                
in general population.  See Palmer v. Richards, 364 F.3d                  
60, 64 (2d Cir. 2004); Colon v. Howard, 215 F.3d 227, 231                 
(2d Cir. 2000).  Some of the plaintiffs were confined in Q-               
Pod for lengthy periods of time, so the duration factor                   

weighs in their favor.  However, the conditions in Q-Pod                  
were not dramatically different from the conditions in                    
general population.                                                       
   In assessing the conditions in Q-Pod for purposes of                 
the Sandin claim, guidance can be drawn from other cases                  

brought in this court by Q-Pod inmates seeking relief under               
Sandin.  In the first case, filed in 2012, Judge Thompson                 
summarized the plaintiff’s allegations with regard to the                 
conditions in Q-Pod as follows:                                           
   The plaintiff alleges that he is denied communal                     
   meals, must shower in the evening rather than                        
   being allowed to choose to shower in the morning                     
   or evening, and can access the prison library only                   
   one day per week. The plaintiff is afforded two                      
   hours out-of-cell time per day, one hour of                          
   recreation in the morning and one hour for showers                   
   and telephone use in the evening. He is not                          
   allowed the additional hour of exercise in a large                   
   outdoor yard or, during inclement weather, in the                    
   gymnasium that other general population inmates                      
   are afforded. The housing unit does not have a                       
   television in the day room or a typewriter for the                   
   unit.                                                                

Ruling on Motion to Dismiss in Part, Harnage v.                           
Brighthaupt, No. 3:12-cv-1521 (AWT) (D. Conn. Feb 12,                     
2014), ECF 42 at 14.  Judge Thompson observed that while                  
these conditions may have been harsher than the conditions                
in other housing units, “the plaintiff had alleged no facts               
describing any condition that an inmate should not expect                 

to undergo by virtue of his incarceration.”  Id. at 18.                   
Accordingly, the plaintiff could not meet the significant                 
and atypical standard of Sandin.                                          
   In the second case, filed in 2015, the same plaintiff                
alleged that while he was in Q-Pod, “prison officials                     

subjected [him] to limited access to library resources,                   
shorter recreation periods, restrictions on photocopying                  
services and no access to intramural sports and communal                  
dining.  In addition, religious and medical services were                 
performed within the unit instead of outside of the unit.”                
Ruling on Motion to Dismiss, Harnage v. Chapdelaine, 3:15-                

cv-1034 (AWT) (D. Conn. Mar. 28, 2017), ECF 25 at 2-3                     
(“Harnage II”).  Judge Thompson again concluded that the                  
conditions alleged by the plaintiff did not meet the Sandin               
standard and he was therefore “not entitled to procedural                 
due process prior to his placement in Q-Pod.”  Id. at 10.                 
   Plaintiffs’ allegations concerning lack of access to                 

jobs, vocational training and classroom instruction go                    
beyond the allegations in the Harnage cases.  But the                     
record does not support a finding that this lack of access                
was a marked departure from the ordinary incidents of                     
prison life.  With regard to jobs, plaintiffs admit that                  

MWCI had a wait list for general population inmates who                   
wanted jobs.7  They also do not dispute that, with the                    
possible exception of “tiermen” in Q-Pod, inmates with                    
disciplinary records did not have jobs.  Id. ¶ 30.  With                  
regard to other programming, the record indicates that                    

eligibility depended on an inmate’s disciplinary record,                  
rather than his housing assignment.  See Pl. Ex., ECF 47-4                
at 20 (grievance from plaintiff Rivera claiming that he had               
been denied program participation because of his placement                
in Q-Pod; response stating that program participation                     
required a clean disciplinary record for 120 days after a                 

Class A violation).                                                       
   The allegations in the present case also go beyond the               
allegations in the Harnage cases with regard to medical and               
religious services.  Plaintiffs allege that services were                 
provided only within Q-Pod, the same allegation made in                   
Harnage II.  But plaintiffs also assert that some Q-Pod                   

inmates were denied access to medical care and religious                  


7 At the pertinent time, there were approximately 1900 inmates at         
MWCI and only about 500 jobs.  ECF 69 ¶ 31-32.                            
services even within the unit, in other words, they were                  
wholly denied access to medical and religious services.                   

These allegations were not made in the Harnage cases.                     
   Viewed most favorably to plaintiffs, the record does                 
not permit a finding that any of them was ever denied                     
access to needed medical care while in Q-Pod.  The                        
assertion that “many times” unidentified “offenders” were                 

denied needed medical care is conclusory in nature.  There                
is no allegation or evidence that any of the plaintiffs had               
a need for medical treatment while in Q-Pod, sought                       
treatment and was denied treatment.                                       
   Plaintiffs’ claim with regard to the alleged denial of               
access to religious services is better supported.                         

Plaintiff Baltas’s affidavit states that he could not                     
smudge in his cell.   His statement is contradicted by                    
contemporaneous documentary evidence.  See Pl. Ex., ECF 47-               
3 at 21 (grievance by plaintiff Baltas claiming that he was               
restricted from practicing his Native American religion by                
smudging with the rest of the general population; response                

by officials stating that inmates in Q-Pod may dry smudge                 
in their cells and that the “Native American Chaplin [sic]                
does a service with the inmates in Q unit.”).  But                        
plaintiff Tarasco’s affidavit makes a similar claim                       
regarding Native American religious services.  He alleges                 

that he “was not allowed to attend [his] religious                        
practices or purifications at all” and that as a result of                
his persistent complaints about this restriction, he “was                 
eventually removed from Q-Pod.”  ECF 47-5 at 6.  Tarasco’s                
claim is buttressed by the affidavit of plaintiff                         

Castellano, which recounts a conversation between Tarasco,                
a Native American Services Alder, and a Q-Pod counselor,                  
which Castellano overheard.  According to Castellano’s                    
account, Tarasco asked the alder about accessing services,                
including a sweat lodge and smudging.  The counselor   said               
the Warden and Deputy Warden had been informed of Tarasco’s               

request and were looking into whether services could be                   
provided.  Both the counselor and the alder said they were                
uncertain whether any services could be provided to Tarasco               
in Q-Pod due to staffing issues.  ECF 47-5 at 7-8.                        
   Viewing the record most favorably to plaintiffs, the                 
affidavits of Baltas, Tarasco and Castellano, in                          

combination, raise a triable issue whether Baltas and                     
Castellano were unable to smudge or attend sweat lodge                    
services in Q-Pod.  But the duration of the deprivation                   
remains unclear.                                                          

  As to the amount of time plaintiffs spent in Q-Pod, the               
record, viewed most favorably to the plaintiffs, shows the                
following:                                                                
   Baltas was in Q-Pod from April 9, 2015 to May 12,                    
2015; then from May 29, 2015 to October 21, 2015; then from               

November 13, 2015 to February 24, 2016; then from April 8,                
2017 to July 3, 2016;                                                     
   Rivera was in Q-Pod for 9 months;                                    
   Tarasco was in Q-Pod for 3 months and a few days;                    
   Rice was in Q-Pod from March 28, 2016 to July 6, 2016;               
And                                                                       

   Gladding was in Q-Pod for longer than 6 months                       
consecutively and ultimately spent a total of more than one               
year in Q-Pod.8                                                           
   Based on this record, I cannot exclude the possibility               
that Baltas, Rivera and Gladding may be able to prove that                
they were confined in Q-Pod without procedural protections                

for a longer period than permitted by the Fourteenth                      


8 The record does not disclose the duration of the other                  
plaintiffs’ confinement in Q-Pod.                                         
Amendment.  A decision by Chief Judge Underhill shows that                
the claims of these plaintiffs have arguable merit.  In                   

Garcia v. Semple, No. 3:18-cv-1226, 2019 WL 5597771 (D.                   
Conn. Oct. 30, 2019), the plaintiff was placed on high                    
security status and moved to a cell in Q-Pod, where he                    
remained for 89 days.  The plaintiff’s affidavit described                
conditions similar to the ones at issue here.  See No.                    

3:18-cv-1226, ECF 1 at ¶ 167.  Judge Underhill concluded                  
that the plaintiff had a plausible procedural due process                 
claim.  See 2019 WL 5597771, *13.9                                        
   However, I agree with the defendants that they are                   
entitled to qualified immunity.  Plaintiffs cite no                       
relevant case authority clearly establishing that confining               

them in Q-Pod without procedural safeguards for the periods               
at issue violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the                       
pertinent time, relevant case authority indicated that                    
confinement in more severe conditions for months at a time                
would not constitute atypical and substantial hardship                    
under Sandin.  See Frazier, 81 F.3d at 317-18 (120 days in                

segregation followed by 30 days loss of recreation and                    


9 The case was later dismissed for failure to prosecute.  See ECF         
35.                                                                       
other privileges did not impose atypical and significant                  
hardship).  Moreover, in the Harnage cases, the plaintiff                 

alleged that he had been in Q-Pod for four or five months                 
at a time.  See Ruling on Motion to Dismiss, Harnage v.                   
Chapdelaine, 3:15-cv-1034 (AWT) (D. Conn. Mar. 28, 2017),                 
ECF 25 at 3.  Accordingly, the dismissal of the procedural                
due process claims in those cases signaled that the                       

conditions in Q-Pod were not so different from the ordinary               
incidents of prison life as to support a claim under                      
Sandin.                                                                   
   I also agree with defendants’ argument that                          
plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief under Sandin are                 
moot.  ECF 56-1 at 28-30.  At the time this motion was                    

briefed, none of the plaintiffs remained in Q-Pod, and only               
two of them remained at MWCI.  See id. at 29-30.  Now, it                 
appears, four plaintiffs are incarcerated at MWCI, but it                 
is unclear whether any of them are housed in Q-Pod.  When                 
an inmate is moved from the facility that is the site of                  
his claim for injunctive relief, the request is generally                 

moot.  Young v. Coughlin, 866 F.2d 567, 568 n.1 (2d Cir.                  
1989); see also Candelaria v. Coughlin, 787 F. Supp. 368,                 
378 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd 979 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1992) ("Because               
plaintiff has now been transferred to another facility, we                
dismiss his claim for injunctive relief as moot.").                       
        ii.  Grievance Process                                          

   Plaintiffs claim that defendants violated their due                  
process rights by failing to properly administer the                      
grievance process.  More specifically, plaintiffs claim                   

that their grievances were not addressed at all or were not               
addressed in a timely manner. Am. Compl., ECF 14 ¶ 47. They               
also object to the practice of resolving grievances by                    
“compromising” them, which did not allow for the usual                    
appeals process. See, e.g., Pl. Ex., ECF 47-4 at 14.  The                 

record does not support a viable due process claim.                       
“Although state laws may in certain circumstances create a                
constitutionally protected entitlement to substantive                     
liberty interests, state statutes do not create federally                 
protected due process entitlements to specific state-                     
mandated procedures.”  Holcomb v. Lykens, 337 F.3d 217, 224               

(2d Cir. 2003) (citations omitted); see Kalican v.                        
Dzurenda, 583 F. App’x 21, 22 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary                     
order) (“Grievance procedures, which are creatures of state               
law, are not interests independently protected by the                     
Constitution . . . .”); see also Green v. Martin, 224 F.                  
Supp. 3d 154, 178 (D. Conn. 2016) (“Prisoners have no                     
constitutionally protected right to have prison officials                 

comply with grievance procedures or even to respond to                    
grievances.”).  Accordingly, defendants are entitled to                   
summary judgment on this claim.                                           
   C.  First Amendment                                                  
         i.  Access to the Courts                                       

   Plaintiffs allege that defendants violated their right               
to access the courts by interfering with their use of the                 
library and the typewriter.10  The record, viewed most                    
favorably to plaintiffs, does not raise a triable issue                   
with regard to this claim.  “[T]here is . . . no                          
constitutional right to a typewriter as an incident to the                

right of access to the courts.”  Taylor v. Coughlin, 29                   
F.3d 39, 40 (2d Cir. 1994) (quotation marks omitted)                      
(quoting Wolfish v. Levi, 573 F.2d 118, 132 (2d Cir. 1978),               


10 Plaintiffs also assert that they were stymied in bringing              
grievances, in violation of the First Amendment.  There is no             
right to a grievance procedure under the First Amendment.                 
Boddie v. Alexander, 356 F. App’x 438, 440 (2d Cir. 2009)                 
(summary order).  “[T]he First Amendment functions only to                
prohibit the government from obstructing the right to petition.”          
Id.  “Because [plaintiffs] allege[], in essence, that the                 
[defendants] failed to assist [their] ability to raise a                  
grievance — not that the [defendants] obstructed [their] ability          
to raise a grievance — [plaintiffs have] failed to state a                
cognizable First Amendment claim.”  Id. at 441.                           
rev’d on other grounds, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520                     
(1979)).                                                                  

   As for library access, the parties dispute how often Q-              
Pod inmates could visit the library.  Again viewing the                   
record in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, I                   
will assume that the plaintiffs had access to the library                 
only once per month, unlike general population inmates on                 

other units who accessed the library once per week.  While                
Bounds v. Smith requires adequate access to a law library                 
as a part of the right to access the courts, 430 U.S. 817,                
829 (1977), plaintiffs still must demonstrate inadequate                  
access resulting in “actual injury.”  Benjamin v. Fraser,                 
264 F.3d 175, 185 (2d Cir. 2001) (“Because law libraries                  

and legal assistance programs do not represent                            
constitutional rights in and of themselves, but only the                  
means to ensure ‘a reasonably adequate opportunity to                     
present claimed violations of fundamental constitutional                  
rights to the courts,’ prisoners must demonstrate ‘actual                 
injury’ in order to have standing.” (quoting Lewis v.                     

Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 351 (1996) (internal quotations                      
omitted)).  In other words, plaintiffs must show that their               
lack of access to the law library was in fact inadequate                  
and impeded their access to the courts.                                   
   The record does not support a finding of actual injury               

as a result of any limited access to the library or                       
typewriters.  In particular, the record does not support a                
finding that “the alleged shortcomings in the library or                  
legal assistance program hindered [any plaintiff’s] efforts               
to pursue a legal claim.” Bourdon v. Loughren, 386 F.3d 88,               

93 (2d Cir. 2004).  Therefore, the defendants are entitled                
to summary judgment on this claim.                                        
        ii.  Free Exercise of Religion                                  
   Plaintiffs claim that they were prevented from                       
engaging in religious practices while in Q-Pod in violation               
of the First Amendment.  As discussed above, Baltas and                   

Tarasco may be able to prove that they were not allowed to                
engage in Native American religious practices in Q-Pod.                   
Even if they were permitted to smudge, they might still be                
able to prove that they were deprived of a “constitutional                
right to participate in congregate religious services.”                   
Salahuddin v. Coughlin, 993 F.2d 306, 308 (2d Cir. 1993).                 

In Salahuddin v. Coughlin, 999 F. Supp. 526, 538-39                       
(S.D.N.Y. 1998), the court held that there must be                        
individualized findings to justify depriving a particular                 
inmate of congregate services.  In other words, mere                      
segregation status on a particular unit is not enough.  See               

also LaReau v. MacDougall, 473 F.2d 974, 979 n.9 (2d Cir.                 
1972) (noting that not all prisoners in segregation                       
“lawfully can be prevented from attending church services                 
in the chapel. Not all segregated prisoners are potential                 
troublemakers; so some discrimination must be made by                     

prison authorities among the inmates in the segregation                   
unit.”).  Furthermore, this claim is distinguishable from                 
other cases that have declined to allow religious freedom                 
claims related to the Q-Pod to go forward. In Shakur v.                   
Sieminski, No. 3:07-cv-1239C, 2009 WL 2151174 (D. Conn.                   
July 15, 2009), summary judgment was granted on the First                 

Amendment claims of a prisoner in Q-Pod. However, in that                 
case, the plaintiff “[did] not allege . . . that he was                   
denied the ability to practice his religion or attend                     
congregate religious services.” Id. at *7. Instead, he only               
alleged that congregate services were “provided in Q-Unit,                
instead of the main building.” Id.  Here, Tarasco                         

specifically alleges that he was denied both the ability to               
practice his religion and to attend congregate religious                  
services.                                                                 
   Nevertheless, I conclude that the defendants are                     
entitled to qualified immunity.  No relevant case authority               

has been cited or found that addresses the First Amendment                
free exercise rights of inmates to participate in sweat                   
lodge or smudging services.  See, e.g., Baltas v. Erfe, No.               
3:19-cv-1820 (MPS), 2022 WL 4260672, *12 (D. Conn. Sept.                  
15, 2022) (“N either party has cited, and the Court is                    

unaware of, any Second Circuit or U.S. Supreme Court                      
precedent that specifically addresses an                                  
inmate's First Amendment right either to demand                           
construction of a sweat lodge within a prison facility, or                
to transfer to a prison facility with sweat lodge access,                 
to accommodate the inmate's free exercise of the Native                   

American religion”); Buckles v. Crowe, 2021 WL 1341887, * 6               
(D. Mont. Feb. 22, 2021) (finding based on a review of                    
federal case law that there is “no clearly established                    
constitutional right to access a sweat lodge in prison to                 
practice the Native American religion”).  In the absence of               
clear case law, qualified immunity applies to the claims of               

Baltas and Tarasco against the defendants in their                        
individual capacities.  And their claims for injunctive                   
relief are moot, as discussed earlier.                                    
   D.  State Law Claims                                                 
   Because summary judgment is properly granted on all the              

federal claims, the state law claims will be dismissed                    
without prejudice.  “[I]n the usual case in which all                     
federal-law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance               
of factors . . . will point toward declining to exercise                  
jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.”  Kolari                

v. New York-Presbyterian Hosp., 455 F.3d 118, 122 (2d Cir.                
2006) (alteration in original) (quoting Carnegie-Mellon                   
Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 n.7 (1988)).  In                       
addition, “district courts may decline to exercise                        
supplemental jurisdiction” where “the claim raises a novel                
or complex issue of State law.”  28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1).                  

In this case, it is unclear whether there are private                     
rights of action for many of plaintiffs’ state                            
constitutional claims.  See Binette v. Sabo, 710 A.2d 688,                
700 (Conn. 1998) (“Whether to recognize a cause of action                 
for alleged violations of other state constitutional                      
provisions in the future must be determined on a case-by-                 

case basis.”).  This counsels against exercising                          
supplemental jurisdiction.  See Lopez v. Smiley, 375 F.                   
Supp. 2d 19, 26 (D. Conn. 2005) (declining jurisdiction                   
over state constitutional claims, citing Binette and                      
“federalism and comity concerns”).  Accordingly, those                    

claims are dismissed without prejudice to refiling in state               
court.  See Kolari, 455 F.3d at 124.                                      
IV.  Conclusion                                                         
   Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is granted with              
regard to the federal claims and plaintiffs’ partial motion               

for summary judgment is denied.  The state law claims are                 
dismissed without prejudice.  The Clerk may enter judgment                
and close the file.
