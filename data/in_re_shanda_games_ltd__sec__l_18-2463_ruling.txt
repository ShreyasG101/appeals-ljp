ANDREW L. CARTER, JR., United States District  Judge: 
     This lawsuit is a putative class action involving alleged federal securities fraud and 
insider trading in the context of a merger. Lead Plaintiff David Monk (‘Plaintiff’) brings this 
action, individually and on behalf of a class of former stockholders and former owners of 
American Depository Shares (“ADS”), against Defendants Shanda Games Limited (“Shanda”), 
Capitalcorp Limited and Capitalhold Limited (together, the “Capital Defendants”), as well as 
Defendants Yingfeng Zhang (“Zhang”), Li Yao, Lijun Lin, Heng Wing Chan, Yong Gui, Shaolin 
Liang, and Danian Chen (collectively, the “Individual Defendants’), alleging violations of the 
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“the Exchange Act”). Defendant Shanda individually, as 
well as Zhang and the Capital Defendants jointly, move to dismiss the Second Amended Class 
Action Complaint (the “SAC”) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state 
a claim upon which relief can be granted. ECF Nos. 90, 95. For the reasons stated herein, the 
motions to dismiss are hereby DENIED IN PART and GRANTED IN PART. 
                        I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
     Defendant Shanda Games Ltd. (“Shanda” or the “Company”) is a global online video 
game company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with its principal executive offices in

Shanghai, China. SAC ¶¶ 33, ECF No. 72. In 2009, Shanda underwent an initial public offering 
and listed American Depository Shares (“ADS”) on the NASDAQ and registered those ADS 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Id. ¶ 5. In mid-2013, Shanda started developing a 
mobile version of one of its most popular computer games, Mir II PC, which is entitled Mir II 

Mobile. SAC ¶¶ 7. Defendant Yingfeng Zhang (“Zhang”) became CEO of Shanda beginning 
October 2014 and Chairman of the Board beginning November 2014. SAC ¶ 36.  
    On April 3, 2015, Shanda announced a proposed merger (the “Transaction”) that would 
allow the Company to buy all Shanda securities held by unaffiliated holders, with Shanda as the 
surviving entity, which would allow the Company to go private. Id. ¶ 10. Although the Buyer 
Group controlled enough votes to execute the merger, the Company was required to file initial 
and final proxy statements (collectively, the “Proxies”) to allow shareholders to determine 
whether they wanted to exercise appraisal rights. Shanda subsequently published an initial proxy 
statement on May 5, 2015, which included summaries of financial projections from March 2014 
and March 2015. SAC ¶¶ 11. From December 2014 through August 2015, Shanda made public 

statements about its optimism for Mir II Mobile. SAC ¶¶ 13-14. On August 3, 2015, Shanda 
launched Mir II Mobile and Shanda employees, including Zhang, publicly recognized its 
success. SAC ¶¶ 15-16. On October 13, 2015, Shanda published a final proxy statement that 
included the same projections from the initial proxy statement. Id. ¶¶ 18-20.  
    Shareholders approved the merger on November 18, 2015 at the Extraordinary 
Shareholders Meeting. Id. ¶¶ 22. Defendant Capitalcorp, wholly owned and controlled by 
Defendant Capitalhold, merged with Shanda as part of the merger. SAC ¶¶ 34-35. Under the 
merger agreement, Shanda common stock owned by unaffiliated holders (all except the Buyer 
Group) was effectively sold at $3.55 per share and $7.10 per ADS. Id. ¶¶ 22, 148. A few 
dissenting shareholders exercised their appraisal rights and sued Shanda, seeking the Grand 
Court of the Cayman Islands’ determination of the fair value of its shares. Id. ¶¶ 23, 24. The 
Grand Court awarded the dissenters $16.68 per ADS. Id. ¶ 25. This award was partially reversed 
by the Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands that determined the fair value of the shares was 

$12.84 per ADS. Id.                                                       
                    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY                               

    On September 30, 2019, this Court granted Shanda’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the 
First Amended Class Action Complaint (the “FAC”) (henceforth, the “2019 Order”). ECF No. 
57. On September 30, 2020, on a motion for reconsideration, this Court concluded that Plaintiff 
failed to state a securities fraud or insider trading claim against Shanda (the “2020 Order”). ECF 
No. 70. Defendants Shanda, Zhang, Capitalcorp, and Capitalhold (“the Moving Defendants”) 
moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim on June 11, 2021. ECF Nos. 90-92, 95-96. By 
omnibus brief, Plaintiff opposed on July 30, 2021. ECF No. 100. On August 27, 2021, Moving 
Defendants filed reply briefs. ECF Nos. 101, 102. The Court considers both motions to dismiss 
fully briefed.                                                            
                    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW                              

A. Rule 12(b)(6)                                                          

    When deciding a motion to dismiss, the Court must “accept as true all factual statements 
alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving 
party.” McCarthy v. Dun & Bradstreet Corp., 482 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir. 2007). However, the 
Court need not credit “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by 
mere conclusory statements.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. 
v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). Claims should be dismissed when a plaintiff has not 
pleaded enough facts that “plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.” Id. at 679. A claim is 
plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the Court to draw the reasonable 
inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 
U.S. at 556). While not akin to a “probability requirement,” the plaintiff must allege sufficient 

facts to show “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted   
unlawfully.” Id. (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). Accordingly, where a plaintiff alleges facts 
that are “ ‘merely consistent with’ a defendant's liability, it ‘stops short of the line between 
possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.’ ” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). 
B. Rule 9(b)                                                              

    Under Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, pleadings must contain only “a 
short and plain statement” of the basis for the court’s jurisdiction and of the claim showing that 
the pleader is entitled to relief, and a demand for the relief sought. Fed. R. Civ P. 8(a). However, 
where, as here, a plaintiff has alleged fraud claims under § 10(b) of the Exchange Act, the 
complaint is subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “PSLRA”). Rule 9(b) requires 
that the complaint “state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.” To 
satisfy the particularity requirement, a complaint must “(1) detail the statements (or omissions) 
that the plaintiff contends are fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the 
statements (or omissions) were made, and (4) explain why the statements (or omissions) are 
fraudulent.” Fin. Guar. Ins. Co. v. Putnam Advisory Co., LLC, 783 F.3d 395, 403 (2d Cir. 2015). 
    The PSLRA holds private securities plaintiffs to an even more stringent pleading 
standard. Under the PSLRA, a plaintiff must “(1) specify each statement alleged to have been 
misleading [and] the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading; and (2) state with 
particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state 
of mind.” Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 321, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 
L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-
4(b)). To determine that an inference of scienter is strong, the court must decide whether “a 

reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any 
opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.” Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 324. 
                          IV. ANALYSIS                                   

    The Court granted Plaintiff limited leave to file the SAC to cure deficiencies identified in 
its 2019 and 2020 Orders ruling on Defendant Shanda’s motion to dismiss the FAC. This time 
around, Plaintiff specifically seeks to remedy two deficiencies: (1) inadequate pleading of 
reliance under a fraud-on-the-market theory, and (2) failure to sufficiently allege insider trading. 
Pl.’s Opp. at 10. On reliance, the SAC incorporates expert analysis from Mr. Chad Coffman to 
raise allegations that Plaintiff traded his ADS in an efficient market. On insider trading, he 
proffers new factual matter to attempt to state claims under Section 10(b) and 20A. Id. 
    Shanda, Zhang, and the Capital Defendants argue that the SAC fails to state a claim for 
relief under the federal securities laws for several reasons. First, the new allegations fail to plead 
reliance. Second, the SAC does not adequately plead loss causation. Third, there are no properly 
pleaded actionable misstatements or omissions to plead fraud, and the new insider trading 
allegations remain insufficient because no defendant purchased ADS from Plaintiff. Fourth and 
finally, Defendants assert a defense under Morrison v. National Australia Bank, Ltd., 561 U.S. 
247 (2010).                                                               
A. Law of the Case                                                        
    As a preliminary matter, the Parties disagree whether this Court’s 2019 and 2020 rulings 
on Shanda’s motion to dismiss the FAC constitute law of the case. The law of the case doctrine 
“forecloses re-litigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the [ ] court.” United States 
v. Quintieri, 306 F.3d 1217, 1229 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted). Absent “cogent or 

compelling reasons,” the law of the case controls. See Johnson v. Holder, 564 F.3d 95, 99-100 
(2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotations omitted). “[W]hen a court decides upon a rule of law, that 
decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case” unless 
the decision “is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.” Arizona v. California, 
460 U.S. 605, 618 & n.8 (1983). The doctrine is discretionary. Id.; accord Lewis v. Whelan, 99 
F.3d 542, 545 (2d Cir. 1996). The law of the case doctrine “counsels against reconsideration” 
where amended pleadings are “very similar” to the previous complaint.” Weslowski v. Zugibe, 96 
F.Supp.3d 308, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (citing State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Mallela, No. 00-
4293, 2002 WL 31946762, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2002)). Accordingly, this Court will 
examine the SAC and apply the law of the case doctrine to recurring issues that do not involve 

new factual allegations.                                                  
    1. The Morrison Test                                                 

    The 2019 Order on Shanda’s motion to dismiss the FAC determined that this case 
satisfies the first prong of Morrison because it involves “transactions in securities listed on 
domestic exchanges.” Sept. 30, 2019 Op. and Order at 6-7. Defendants, including Shanda, 
reassert this argument in their moving papers. However, the 2019 Order was not an invitation to 
revive this issue on a second motion to dismiss. Defendants also had an opportunity to seek 
reconsideration within 14 days of entry of the 2019 Order. They did not do so. Because facts 
regarding Morrison remain the same and no “cogent or compelling reasons” exist to revisit this 
issue, further litigation of the Morrison issue is foreclosed.            
B. Federal Securities Fraud Claims                                        

    Defendants Shanda and Zhang argue that the SAC should be dismissed because it fails to 
adequately plead the essential elements of a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. To state a 
claim under both Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, Plaintiff must show: “(i) a 
material misrepresentation or omission; (ii) scienter; (iii) a connection with the purchase or sale 
of security; (iv) reliance by the plaintiff(s); (v) economic loss; and (vi) loss causation.” In re 
Omnicom Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., 597 F.3d 501, 509 (2d Cir. 2010). See also 15 U.S.C. § 78u–4(b). 
    Based on this Court’s prior rulings, the law of the case controls the previously litigated 
issues here—namely whether Plaintiff has pleaded material misrepresentations or omissions and 
scienter (which they have). 2019 Order at 7-15.1 On the element of reliance, Plaintiff does not 
allege direct reliance with respect to Plaintiff or any potential class members. Rather, he has 
proffered amendments that attempt to plead that he and other ADS holders traded in an efficient 

market, which would entitle them to a rebuttable presumption of reliance under the fraud-on-the-
market doctrine. If Plaintiff can plead reliance, economic loss, and loss causation, he will 
adequately state a claim for securities fraud against Shanda and Zhang. Though Plaintiff now 
pleads reliance, he fails to adequately allege loss causation. Because he fails to plead loss 
causation, the Court need not reach economic loss element.                
    1. Reliance2                                                         



1 2019 Order at 7-15.                                                     
2 The Court has already concluded that Plaintiff only sufficiently alleged materially false misstatements—not 
omissions—so the Affiliated Ute presumption of reliance does not apply. 2019 Order at 16 n.2. Re-litigation of this 
issue is barred by the law of the case doctrine.                          
    Pursuant to the fraud-on-the-market doctrine, “the market price of shares traded on well-
developed markets reflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material 
misrepresentations.” Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. 804, 131 S. Ct. 2179, 
2181, 180 L. Ed. 2d 24 (2011) (quoting Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 

L.Ed.2d 194 (1988)). Because the market “transmits information to the investor in the processed 
form of a market price,” we can assume that an investor relies on public misstatements whenever 
he “buys or sells stock at the price set by the market.” Id.              
    To plead reliance based on the presumption created by the fraud-on-the-market theory, a 
plaintiff “first must allege that the relevant market was open and developed or, in other words, 
efficient.” In re Parmalat Sec. Litig., 375 F.Supp.2d 278, 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). While the 
Second Circuit has “declined to adopt a particular test for market efficiency[,] . . . district courts 
in this and other Circuits regularly consider” the following:             
    (1) the average weekly trading volume of the [stock], (2) the number of securities 
    analysts following and reporting on [it], (3) the extent to which market makers 
    traded in the [stock], (4) the issuer's eligibility to file an SEC registration Form S–
    3, and (5) the demonstration of a cause and effect relationship between unexpected, 
    material disclosures and changes in the [stock’s] price[ ].          

Waggoner v. Barclays PLC, 875 F.3d 79, 94 (2d Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 1702 (2018) 
(internal quotations and citations omitted).                              

    Here, the SAC adds expert analysis from Mr. Chad Coffman who assessed whether 
Shanda ADS traded in an efficient market during the proposed class period “using generally 
recognized techniques.” SAC ¶¶ 284-85. Mr. Coffman is the President of Global Economics 
Group, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in economics, statistics, and valuation in many 
different contexts, including securities litigation. SAC ¶¶ 284. He opined “that the market for 
Shanda’s ADS was efficient throughout the Class Period.” SAC ¶¶ 285. The SAC contains “a 
limited summary of the facts and factors relevant to [his] conclusion that Shanda traded in an 
efficient market.” SAC ¶¶  285.                                           
    The Parties disagree whether this Court should credit the expert analysis at this stage in 
the litigation. Neither party presents case law that squarely addresses this question. This Court 

concludes that the approach taken on a substantially similar issue in another federal securities 
case entitled Ong v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 294 F.Supp.3d 199, 222 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), very 
persuasive. Other judges in this Circuit agree. See, e.g., Tung v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., No. 
1:18-CV-01611 (MKV), 2020 WL 5849220, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2020), aff'd sub 
nom. Arkansas Pub. Emps. Ret. Sys. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., No. 20-3716-CV, 2022 WL 
727149 (2d Cir. Mar. 11, 2022).                                           
    In Ong, Defendants moved to strike an expert witness declaration and portions of the 
complaint that relied on expert testimony in the context of a motion to dismiss. Applying Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 10(c) and the incorporation-by-reference doctrine as interpreted by the Second Circuit, 
U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla declined to consider the declaration in evaluating the 

legal sufficiency of the complaint. She reasoned that the expert declaration was not relied upon 
in drafting the complaint and that defendants’ substantive challenges to the strength and accuracy 
of the declaration raised complex evidentiary issues that were inappropriate for the pleadings 
stage. Judge Failla struck the declaration from the complaint and declined to consider any 
conclusory allegations based on the declaration, including legal conclusions made by the expert, 
though she did still consider well-pleaded factual allegations.           
    Like in Ong, Defendants here challenge the accuracy and strength of the expert analysis 
from Coffman. Instead of a declaration, here, Plaintiff attached slides prepared by Coffman and 
added his analysis of the Cammer and Krogman factors3 into the body of the SAC. SAC ¶¶  286-
301. For the same reasons that Judge Failla declined to consider the expert declaration in Ong, 
this Court will neither consider the Coffman slides nor his expert analysis. The former is not a 
“written document” as defined by Rule 10(c), and the latter constitutes improper legal 

conclusions. This Court will only consider well-pleaded factual averments. 
    Solely examining well-pleaded, non-conclusory factual allegations, Plaintiff now meets 
his burden, albeit minimally, of showing that he traded in an efficient market. Taking his 
amended factual allegations as true, Plaintiff states that weekly trading volume exceeded 2% for 
most of the proposed class period (Cammer factor 1) and that 46 market makers traded in ADS 
during that same period (Cammer factor 3). At this stage, the Court is not to weigh the strength 
of these factors. Thus, these allegations are sufficient to plead an efficient market. Whether these 
two factors are probative indicators of market efficiency is to be decided as a question of fact 
later in this litigation. “While the Court notes that . . . Plaintiff[ ] . . . alleges facts that draw the 
efficiency of the [ADS] market into question, whether a market is efficient ‘is not a pure 

question of law’ and normally should not be decided on a motion to dismiss.” In re Merrill 
Lynch Auction Rate Sec. Litig., 704 F. Supp. 2d 378, 395 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), aff'd sub nom. Wilson 


3 Both Cammer and Krogman provide a set of factors that district courts typically use to determine market 
efficiency. In Krogman, the court wrote:                                  

    In evaluating whether the market for an individual stock is efficient, courts have looked to a number 
    of factors. See, e.g., Cammer, 711 F.Supp. at 1286–87; O'Neil v. Appel, 165 F.R.D. 479, 503 
    (W.D.Mich.  1996).  The Cammer court  identified  five factors relevant  to  the  determination  of 
    market efficiency: (1) the stock’s average trading volume; (2) the number of analysts that followed 
    and reported on the stock; (3) the number of market makers; (4) eligibility to file an S–3 Registration 
    Statement; and (5) the reaction of the stock price to unexpected news events. Cammer, 711 F.Supp. 
    at 1286–87. Other courts have applied additional factors, based on economic literature, including: 
    (1) the capitalization of the company; (2) the bid-ask spread of the stock; and (3) the percentage of 
    stock not held by insiders (the “float”).                            

Krogman v. Sterritt, 202 F.R.D. 467, 474 (N.D. Tex. 2001) (citations and footnotes omitted) (cleaned up). 
v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 671 F.3d 120 (2d Cir. 2011) (footnote omitted) (quoting In re Initial 
Public Offering Sec. Litig., 241 F.Supp.2d 281, 377 (S.D.N.Y.2003)). “The Court cannot say, on 
the record before it, that . . . Plaintiff[ ] cannot establish an efficient market.” Id. As further noted 
in In re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., “[t]he present finding—that plaintiff[ ] ha[s] made a 

sufficient showing that the . . . markets were efficient—is solely for the purposes of adjudicating 
the pending motion to dismiss and is not binding on the finder of fact.” In re IPO, 241 F.Supp.2d 
at 288. “Based on the evidence presented at trial, the finder of fact may conclude that the 
relevant markets were efficient . . . [o]n the other hand, the finder of fact may conclude that one 
or more of the relevant markets was inefficient.” Id. “This determination is also not binding for 
purposes of class certification.” Id. At this early pleading stage, the Court will presume that ADS 
holders, such as Plaintiff, could have reasonably relied on the integrity of the market price when 
deciding whether to exercise dissenters’ rights or sell shares at the negotiated price. 
    2. Loss Causation                                                    

    This is where Plaintiff’s securities fraud claims fail. He has not pleaded loss causation 
under Section 10(b). These elements are separate and distinct from reliance. The fraud-on-the-
market theory creates “a rebuttable presumption of reliance, not a presumption of causation.” See 
Robbins v. Kroger Props. Inc., 116 F.3d at 1448 (citing Basic U.S. at 141-42, 108 S.Ct. 978). 
“Loss causation . . . requires a plaintiff to show that a misrepresentation that affected the 
integrity of the market price also caused a subsequent economic loss.” Halliburton Co., 563 U.S. 
at 812, 131 S. Ct. at 2186, 180 L.Ed.2d 24 (2011); 15 U.S.C. § 78u–4(b)(4). To establish loss 
causation, plaintiffs must show “that the subject of the fraudulent statement or omission was the 
cause of the actual loss suffered.” Suez Equity Inv’rs, L.P. v. Toronto-Dominion Bank, 250 F.3d 
87, 95 (2d Cir. 2001).                                                    
    The SAC fails to plead loss causation. There are no allegations substantiating how or why 
the material misstatements—omission of 2020 summary data and the application of new methods 
to calculate depreciation and amortization figures in the Proxies—would have (i) affected the 
integrity of the market price and (ii) thus caused a subsequent economic loss to Plaintiff. For 

example, the SAC lacks allegations explaining in a plausible manner how or why Plaintiff was 
personally induced to sell his shares instead of exercising his appraisal rights. Upon the proposed 
merger announcement, the only outstanding issue for ADS holders to decide was whether to 
personally exercise appraisal rights or sell at the negotiated price of $7.10 per ADS. Plaintiff has 
not proffered sufficient and specific allegations to support any causal link between the alleged 
misrepresentations and his failure to provide timely written notice of objection to the Transaction 
(to exercise appraisal rights). Loreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, 797 F.3d 
160, 185 (2d Cir. 2015) (“[W]hereas foreseeability is to some extent relevant to proximate cause, 
it is ‘aftseeability’ that matters for loss causation . . . even though the link may not have been 
anticipated and may only have been shown to exist after the fact.”). In fact, Plaintiff only came to 

know of his purported economic loss after the Cayman Islands proceedings. SAC para 277 
(“Plaintiff and Class Members suffered economic loss when they sold their Shanda Securities for 
less than those securities were worth. Through the Appraisal Suit, and the subsequent appeal, it 
was determined that the fair value of the shares was $12.84.”). The logic in Loreley applies with 
equal force here. In the context of a forced sale of shares with a pre-negotiated price, Plaintiff 
does not plead that any causal link exists between the alleged misrepresentations and his failure 
to exercise appraisal rights. For this reason, he cannot sustain securities fraud claims under 
Section 10(b) against Shanda or Zhang.                                    
    In sum, Plaintiff has failed to state a securities fraud claim under Section 10(b) against 
Defendants Shanda and Zhang (Count I). Because there is no primary fraud violation under 
Section 10(b), it follows that Zhang cannot be held liable as a control person under Section 20(a) 
(Count IV).4                                                              

C. Insider Trading Claims                                                 

    This Court previously held that Plaintiff failed to state an insider trading claim against 
Shanda under Section 10(b) and Section 20A because he failed to adequately plead that Shanda 
was the purchaser in the going-private transaction. Plaintiff has proffered new insider trading 
allegations, including adding the Capital Defendants as parties to this case. At this early pleading 
stage, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has stated a claim for insider trading against Defendant 
Zhang only.                                                               
    Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are “violated when a corporate insider trades in the 
securities of his corporation on the basis of material, nonpublic information.” United States v. 
O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 651–52, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997). Thus, “a corporate 
insider must abstain from trading in the shares of his corporation unless he has first disclosed all 
material inside information known to him.” Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 227, 100 
S.Ct. 1108, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980). The Second Circuit has explained that “[a]ny duty of 


4 Under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act:                                

    Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this 
    chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to 
    the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable, 
    unless the controlled person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or 
    acts constituting the violation or cause of action.                  

15 U.S.C. § 78t(a). In the Second Circuit, to plead a prima facie case of control person liability, a plaintiff must 
allege: “(1) a primary violation by the controlled person, (2) control of the primary violator by the defendant, and (3) 
that the defendant was, in some meaningful sense, a culpable participant in the controlled person’s fraud.” ATSI 
Commc’ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d at 108.                      
disclosure is owed only to those investors trading contemporaneously with the insider; non-
contemporaneous traders do not require the protection of the ‘disclose or abstain’ rule because 
they do not suffer the disadvantage of trading with someone who has superior access to 
information.” Wilson v. Comtech Telecommun. Corp., 648 F.2d 88, 94-95 (2d Cir. 1981) 

(citing Fridrich v. Bradford, 542 F.2d 307, 326 (6th Cir. 1976) (Celebrezze, J., concurring), cert. 
denied, 429 U.S. 1053, 97 S.Ct. 767, 50 L.Ed.2d 769 (1977)).              
    Similarly, in creating a private cause of action for insider trading, Section 20A expressly 
limited standing to contemporaneous investors in securities of the same class. 15 U.S.C. § 78t-
1(a). “In order to state a claim under Section 20A(a), plaintiffs must: (1) plead a predicate insider 
trading violation of the Exchange Act and (2) allege sufficient facts showing ‘that the defendant 
traded the security at issue contemporaneously with the plaintiff.’” In re Take-Two Interactive 
Sec. Litig., 551 F. Supp. 2d 247, 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted).                                                                 
    1. Contemporaneous Trading                                           

         a. Shanda                                                       

    Shanda is still not properly deemed a purchaser of ADS. The SAC merely alleges that 
Shanda held the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting, approved the proposed merger, and when 
the merger became effective, converted “the right to surrender one ADS in exchange for 
US$7.10.” SAC ¶¶ 321. However, as the SAC continues to assert and as explained in the 2020 
Order, Shanda was the surviving entity after the merger went into effect. The allegations do not 
fix the pleading problem here, which is that the commitment to accept or appraise came before 
the merger took effect, and the surviving entity Shanda did not exist until that time. There is thus 
no way that Plaintiff could have committed to the Transaction with surviving corporation 
Shanda. The allegations are inadequate to plead that Shanda was a purchaser. 
         b. Capitalhold                                                  

    However, there is no doubt, and there appears to be no serious dispute among the Parties, 
that Capitalhold purchased ADS based on the Final Proxy Statement and Merger Agreement. 
SAC ¶¶ 222, 226, 318.5 Capitalhold gained full ownership interest in Shanda following the 
merger and distributed the money used to pay the merger consideration to shareholders. SAC ¶¶ 
321(b). In the context of the specific type of merger at issue, Plaintiff and Capitalhold may be 
deemed a seller and purchaser of ADS, respectively. See Liana Carrier Ltd. v. Pure Biofuels 
Corp., 672 F. App’x 85, 91 (2d Cir. 2016) (summary order) (citing Vine v. Beneficial Finance 
Co., 374 F.2d 627, 635 (2d Cir. 1967) and Goldberg v. Meridor, 567 F.2d 209 (2d Cir. 1977); 
see also KDH Consulting Grp. LLC v. Iterative Cap. Mgmt. L.P., 528 F. Supp. 3d 192, 205 
(S.D.N.Y. 2021) (explaining that Vine created the “forced sale” doctrine, whereby the nature of a 
short form merger may permit shareholders to bring a Section 10(b) claim). Contrary to 

Defendants’ belief, Vine dealt with interpreting “sale” or “purchase” language under Section 
10(b), and that case did not distinguish between fraud and non-fraud claims. Plaintiff sufficiently 
pleads that the trade was contemporaneous because he sold his ADS and Capitalhold paid for 
them at closing on November 18, 2015.                                     
         c. Capitalcorp and Zhang                                        

    Plaintiff asserts that both Capitalcorp and Zhang are purchasers because they each acted 
on behalf of Capitalhold in carrying out the purchase of shares. But the allegations only plausibly 
demonstrate that Zhang, in his capacity as sole director, employee, and indirect owner of 

5 Zhang and the Capital Defendants state that “it was Capitalhold that paid the merger consideration and ended up 
owning Shanda. Defs.’ Zhang Mem. at 4 (ECF No. 96 at 8) (citations omitted and emphasis original). 
Capitalhold, was a purchaser of ADS. Plaintiff alleges that Capitalcorp was “created to effectuate 
the purchase of the outstanding Shanda Securities owned by Unaffiliated Holders.” SAC ¶¶ 
321(c). But Plaintiff fails to assert that he ever committed to Capitalcorp with respect to the 
Transaction, does not proffer adequate factual content to substantiate how Plaintiff committed to 

Capitalcorp, and provides no legal authority to support the proposition that merely effectuating a 
purchase would deem Capitalcorp a purchaser itself. Plaintiff further states that Zhang directed 
Capitalhold and Capitalcorp to purchase the Shanda securities. Taking the material allegations as 
true, Zhang indirectly owned 15% of Capitalhold equity, directed that entity to purchase 
securities in his capacity as its sole director and employee, and signed the merger documents for 
the Transaction on its behalf, thus it is plausible that he is a purchaser of ADS.6  
    In sum, the contemporaneous trading requirement is met with respect to Defendants 
Capitalhold and Zhang. “[T]he time of a ‘purchase or sale’ of securities within the meaning of 
Rule 10b-5 is to be determined as the time when the parties to the transaction are committed to 
one another.” Radiation Dynamics, Inc. v. Goldmuntz, 464 F.2d 876, 891 (2d Cir. 1972). As 

discussed in the 2020 Order, Plaintiff twice pleaded that his ADS were sold on November 18, 
2015—not the earlier date of dissent—a judicial admission to which he was and remains bound. 
2020 Order at 4.7 The SAC has pleaded that the trade occurred contemporaneously with the 
purchased made by Capitalhold and/or Zhang.                               
    2. Corporate and Temporary Insiders                                  

    Though the Court has reasoned that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that Defendants 
Capitalhold and Zhang satisfy the contemporaneous trading requirement for his insider trading 

6 Because Capitalcorp is not a purchaser, it is not plausible that Zhang would be a purchaser by acting on its behalf. 
7 The SAC still contains these same allegations. That Plaintiff sold his shares on November 18, 2015—the date of 
closing.                                                                  
claims, only Zhang had a duty to disclose. Plaintiff cannot sustain an insider trading claim 
against Capitalhold because it was neither a temporary insider nor tippee. 
    Plaintiff alleges that Zhang, a top executive at Shanda, possessed material non-public 
information (“MNPI”) regarding Mir II Mobile data, and did not disclose such information 

before purchasing Plaintiff’s ADS. He would thus be liable as a corporate insider under the 
“traditional” or “classical theory” of insider trading, as articulated in O’Hagan, 521 U.S. at 652, 
117 S.Ct. at 2207, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) (citing cases). “The classical theory applies . . . to 
officers, directors, and other permanent insiders of a corporation.” Id. at 652 (quoting Dirks v. 
SEC, 463 U.S. 646, 655 n.14, 103 S.Ct. 3255, 3262, 77 L.Ed.2d 911 (1983)).  
    Whether his knowledge may be imputed to Capitalhold is a separate question that this 
Court answers in the negative. Under a misappropriation theory of insider trading liability, “a 
person violates Rule 10b-5 when he misappropriates [MNPI] in breach of a fiduciary duty or 
similar relationship of trust and confidence and uses that information in a securities transaction.” 
United States v. Falcone, 257 F.3d 226, 230 (2d Cir. 2001). “[A] qualifying relationship does not 

require one to be a traditional corporate insider.” United States v. Kosinski, 976 F.3d 135, 144 
(2d Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2755, 210 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2021). A corporate outsider may 
become a “temporary insider” when confidential corporate information is revealed to him or her, 
such as an attorney or accountant, which may result in developing a fiduciary relationship 
between the outsider and shareholders. Id. (citing Dirks, 463 U.S. at 655 n.14, 103 S.Ct. 3255). 
“Temporary insiders are therefore forbidden from trading under both the classical and 
misappropriation theories without the requisite disclosure.” Id. at 145.  
    Capitalhold is not a temporary insider. Plaintiff asserts that Capitalhold is a temporary 
insider simply because Zhang is its sole director and, as Shanda CEO, he controlled the entity. 
But that is not enough to establish that Capitalhold itself owed any fiduciary duty or special 
relationship to shareholders. It was not a professional advisor or consultant to Zhang. Plaintiff 
also cites no controlling cases providing that an artificial entity may be held liable as a temporary 
insider. Courts generally find individuals to be temporary insiders.      

3. Tippees                                                                

    Because this is far from a conventional tipping case, Capitalhold is not subject to tippee 
liability. “Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 also reach situations where the insider or 
misappropriator tips another who trades on the information.” S.E.C. v. Obus, 693 F.3d 276, 285 
(2d Cir. 2012). As articulated in Dirks, “a tipper . . . is liable if the tipper breached a fiduciary 
duty by tipping MNPI, had the requisite scienter . . . when he gave the tip, and personally 
benefited from the tip.” Id. “Personal benefit” is defined broadly and includes, but is not limited 
to, “pecuniary gain” and “reputational benefit.” Id. (citing Dirks at 663-64, 103 S.Ct. 3255. 
“When an unlawful tip occurs, the tippee is also liable if he knows or should know that the 
information was received from one who breached a fiduciary duty (such as an insider or a 
misappropriator) and the tippee trades or tips for personal benefit with the requisite scienter.” Id. 
(citing Dirks, at 660, 103 S.Ct. 3255).                                   
    Here, Plaintiff argues that Capitalhold is a tippee because it obtained MNPI from Zhang 
who personally benefited from the merger transaction as a member of the Buyer Group. This 
argument fails. First, Plaintiff pleads that Zhang is the sole director, employee, and indirect 
owner of 50% Capitalhold equity. But Plaintiff does not plead that Zhang passed MNPI to any 
other Capitalhold investor and that such investor knew or should have known that the 
information was received in breach of his fiduciary duties. Second, there are no allegations that 
Capitalhold personally benefited from any alleged tip. Plaintiff only alleges that Zhang himself 
personally benefited in the form of windfall gains following the Transaction. SAC 4f 26. Finally, 
Plaintiff cites no case law that an artificial entity may be held liable as a tippee under insider 
trading law. 
     In sum, the insider trading claims against Defendants Shanda, Capitalcorp, and 
Capitalhold must therefore be dismissed.* 
                              V. CONCLUSION 
     Defendants’ motions to dismiss are hereby denied in part and granted in part. Count I 
(fraud) is dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to plead loss causation. Accordingly, Count 
IV (fraud) is also dismissed because there is no primary violation to sustain a Section 20(a) claim 
for control personal liability. Counts II and III (insider trading) are dismissed against Defendants 
Shanda, Capitalcorp, and Capitalhold. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the 
motions at ECF Nos. 90 and 95 and to terminate Defendants Shanda, Capitalhold, and 
Capitalcorp from the case. Lead Plaintiff and the remaining defendants shall file a joint status 
report within 14 days informing the Court how they would like to proceed with this case. The 
Clerk of Court is instructed to terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 90, 95.

                                         United States District  Judge 

Because insider trading claims against the Capital Defendants are dismissed, this Court need not reach their 
arguments that Plaintiffs second claim (Count II) is untimely.

IN RE SHANDA LIMITED SECURITIES 
LITIGATION                                   OPINION AND ORDER 

ANDREW L. CARTER, JR., United States District Judge: 

                             INTRODUCTION 
    On September 30, 2019, this Court issued an Opinion dismissing Plaintiff's Amended 
Complaint. On October 25, 2019, Plaintiff moved the Court to reconsider that Opinion, or, in the 
alternative, for leave to amend the complaint. Upon careful consideration, Plaintiff’s motion is 
DENIED in part and GRANTED in part. To the extent reconsideration is granted, the Court finds 
Plaintiffs arguments without merit. 

                                BACKGROUND 

    The facts of this case were fully set forth in the Court’s Opinion dated September 30, 2019. 
In re Shanda Games Ltd. Sec. Litig., No.  1:18-cv-02463 (ALC), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171592 
(S.D.N.Y. Sep. 30, 2019). Accordingly, familiarity with the facts is assumed and the summary to 
follow will only highlight facts necessary for the motion presently before the Court. 

    Defendant Shanda Games is a global video game company incorporated and headquartered 
in the Cayman Islands. Amended Complaint (“AC”), ECF No. 25 45. On April 3, 2015, Shanda 
announced a merger agreement by which the company would go private. AC {ff 10, 102. Although 
the prospective buyers, the “Buyer Group”, controlled enough Shanda votes to enter into the

transaction, Shanda was required to file initial and final proxy statements to allow shareholders to 
determine whether they wanted to accept the offer price or exercise appraisal rights. AC ¶ 108.  

   On May 5, 2015, Defendant Shanda published an initial proxy statement ("Initial Proxy") 
explaining the merger that included, inter alia, projections for an unreleased game called Mir II 
Mobile. It subsequently published a final proxy statement on October 13, 2015, ("Final Proxy"), 
that included the same projections. AC ¶¶ 131-132.                        
   Shareholders approved the merger on November 18, 2015. AC ¶¶ 22, 144. Under the 
merger agreement, Shanda stockholders received $3.55 per share and Shanda ADS owners 

received $7.10 per ADS. AC ¶¶ 144-45. “As a result of the Transaction, Shanda merged into 
Capitalcorp Limited, a Cayman Islands corporation created for the purpose of the Transaction. AC 
¶ 147. Shanda was the surviving entity of that merger and became a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Capitalhold Limited, a Cayman Islands corporation. AC ¶ 147. Capitalhold Limited was owned 
by a set of individuals Plaintiff refers to as Buyer Group 5, which thereby indirectly owned Shanda. 
AC ¶ 147.                                                                 

   Some dissenting shareholders exercised their appraisal rights and brought suit against 
Defendant Shanda, seeking the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands' determination of the fair value 
of its shares. AC ¶¶ 22-23, 151. The Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands determined the fair 
value of the shares was $12.84 per ADS. AC ¶¶ 25.                         
                       STANDARD OF REVIEW                               

   Reconsideration “is an extraordinary remedy to be employed sparingly in the interests of 
finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.” Sigmon v. Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., 
229 F. Supp. 3d 254, 257 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (citing Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich Ltd., 164 F. Supp. 
3d 558, 560 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). A court will grant such a motion only where the party seeking 
reconsideration identifies “an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new 
evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.” Kolel Beth Yechiel 
Mechil of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Trust, 729 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing Virgin 

Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat'l Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992)). "The standard for 
granting such a motion is strict, and reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving 
party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked—matters, in other words, 
that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court." Shrader v. CSX 
Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing Schonberger v. Serchuk, 742 F. Supp. 108, 
119 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)). The decision to grant or deny a motion for reconsideration is committed to 
the sound discretion of the district court, but in exercising that discretion, the court “must be 
mindful that a motion for reconsideration is not favored and is properly granted only upon a 
showing of exceptional circumstances.” Boyd v. J.E. Robert Co., No. 05-CV-2455, 2013 WL 
5436969, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2013), aff’d, 765 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Nakshin v. 

Holder, 360 Fed.Appx. 192, 193 (2d Cir. 2010)).                           
                         DISCUSSION                                     
1. Applicability of the Presumption of Reliance                         
   In its September 30, 2019 Opinion, the Court concluded that Plaintiff failed to plead an
efficient market, and therefore failed to plead that the presumption of reliance was applicable. 
Opinion at 25. Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider this conclusion, directing the Court to 
purportedly  controlling  precedent  on  the  breadth  of  the  presumption  of  reliance  and  its 
applicability in off-market transactions. However, none of the authority that Plaintiff points to 
shows clear error in this Court’s conclusion, nor that reconsideration is necessary to prevent 
manifest injustice.                                                       
   Plaintiff cites cases that set forth the fundamentals of the presumption of reliance: Basic 
Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 247 (1988), Ark. Teachers Ret. Sys. v. Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc., 
879 F.3d 474 (2d Cir. 2018) and Black v. Finantra Capital, Inc., 418 F.3d 203, 210 (2d Cir. 2005). 
But the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate an efficient market and thereby 

plead  reliance  was  not  predicated  on  a  disagreement  with  the  fundamentals  of  the  Basic 
presumption. Rather, it was in acknowledgement of the unique application that Plaintiff seeks.  
   Plaintiff has pleaded that but for Shanda’s alleged fraud “the market price for Shanda’s 
ADS would have reflected its true value (notwithstanding the fact that Buyer Group 5 had enough 
votes to force the Transaction to be completed at the $7.10 per ADS price), because the availability 
of appraisal as a remedy would have prevented the deal price from serving as a ceiling limiting the 
upper-price of the Shanda Securities.” AC ¶ 280.                          

   In light of the unique conditions that Plaintiff set off as a “notwithstanding” parenthetical, 
this Court looked to cases like In re Initial Public Offerings Securities Litigation. There, the 
Second Circuit concluded that “the Plaintiffs' own allegations and evidence” demonstrated a lack 
of efficient market because IPO markets are generally not efficient, and plaintiff alleged the market 
was slow to integrate corrective information. 471 F.3d 24, 42 (2d Cir. 2006), decision clarified on 
denial of reh 'g sub nom. In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 483 F .3d 70 (2d Cir. 2007).  

   Like in In re Initial Public Offerings Securities Litigation, the facts Plaintiff pleaded do not 
make out an efficient market during the class period. According to Plaintiff, “Shanda Securities 
were covered by numerous securities analysts employed by major brokerage firms who wrote 
reports that were distributed to the sales force and certain customers of their respective firms, 
though many of these firms discontinued coverage after the announcement of the proposed 
Transaction.” AC ¶ 283 (emphasis added). The suspension of analyst coverage at the beginning 
of the class period in response to the at-issue transaction points towards an inefficient market.  

   While  Plaintiff  pleads  that  “[t]he  market  reacted  promptly  to  public  information 
disseminated by Shanda”, AC ¶283(e), its allegations do not show that. Plaintiff alleges Shanda 
and the press publicly discussed the great demand and expectations for MIR II Mobile during the 
class period, AC ¶ 76. But Plaintiff does not plead a single increase in Shanda stock associated 
with any such announcements. Rather, Plaintiff pleads that the market price of Shanda ranged 
between $6.07 per share and $6.98 for the duration of the class period. AC ¶ 279. That is, regardless 
of public statements about Mir II Mobile being massively successful, the share price never went 
above the $7.10 per ADS price at which the transaction eventually occurred. This too points to a 
lack of an efficient market that was incorporating news about Shanda’s value into its price.  

   In light of this, the Court finds no clear error in its conclusion that Shanda failed to plead 
an efficient market, such that ADS holders could have reasonably relied on the integrity of the 
market price when they chose to sell shares. Plaintiff’s request for reconsideration as to reliance is 
DENIED.                                                                   

2. Insider Trading Pursuant to Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 10(b), Securities
   Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 and Section 20A by Shanda             
   The Court recognizes that its Opinion overlooked Plaintiff’s insider trading arguments. The
Court will therefore GRANT Plaintiff’s request to reconsider this issue. First, Plaintiff asks the 
Court to reconsider whether Plaintiff adequately pleaded that Shanda committed an insider trading 
violation under Section 10(b), and therefore pleaded a Section 20A claim against Shanda. ECF 

No. 59 at 5. Second, Plaintiff asks the Court to reconsider whether “under insider trading law, 
Shanda had a duty to disclose all material information prior to buying Plaintiff’s ADS”, such that 
Shanda not releasing the Mir II Mobile data is actionable. ECF No. 59 at 15-16. For the reasons 
that follow, the Court finds no merit in Shanda’s insider trading arguments.  

   Section  10(b)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  and  Securities  Exchange 
Commission Rule 10b-5 are “violated when a corporate insider trades in the securities of his 
corporation on the basis of material, nonpublic information.” United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 
642, 651–52 (1997). Thus, “a corporate insider must abstain from trading in the shares of his 
corporation unless he has first disclosed all material inside information known to him.” Chiarella 
v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 227 (1980). The Second Circuit has explained that "[a]ny duty of
disclosure is owed only to those investors trading contemporaneously with the insider; non-
contemporaneous traders do not require the protection of the 'disclose or abstain' rule because they 

do not suffer the disadvantage of trading with someone who has superior access to information." 
Wilson v. Comtech Telecommun. Corp., 648 F.2d 88, 94-95 (2d Cir. 1981) (citing Fridrich v. 
Bradford, 542 F.2d 307, 326 (6th Cir. 1976) (Celebrezze, J., concurring), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 
1053 (1977)).                                                             
   Similarly, in creating a private cause of action for insider trading, Section 20A expressly 
limited standing to contemporaneous investors in securities of the same class. 15 U.S.C. § 78t-

1(a). “In order to state a claim under Section 20A(a), plaintiffs must: (1) plead a predicate insider 
trading violation of the Exchange Act, and (2) allege sufficient facts showing ‘that the defendant 
traded the security at issue 'contemporaneously' with the plaintiff.’” In re Take-Two Interactive 
Sec. Litig., 551 F. Supp. 2d 247, 309 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (citations omitted). 
   Here, Plaintiff’s insider trading claims center on the completion of the going-private 
transaction. Plaintiff asserts that Shanda was the purchaser in that transaction—in which case the 
contemporaneous trading requirement would be met. However, Plaintiff has not pleaded facts to 
support this assertion.                                                   

   Plaintiff concedes that Shanda was not the payor in the going-private transaction. Reply at 
3 (“. . . Plaintiff admits the Amended Complaint erred in alleging that this payment was made by 
Shanda. . . .”). The Final Proxy and Merger Agreement indicate that the entities that paid for the 
shares were Capitalhold Limited, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under 
the laws of the Cayman Islands, and Capitalcorp Limited, an exempted company with limited 
liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Capitolhold. ECF No. 45-1 at I; ECF No. 61-1 at 10.                       

   Plaintiff takes the position that Shanda is a purchaser as well but fails to plead facts 
substantiating  how.  Plaintiff  seems  to  suggest  that  the  sale  of  the  ADS  occurred  after the 
Transaction from which Shanda was the surviving corporation. ECF No. 56 at 18-10. This is not 
right. “[T] he time of a ‘purchase or sale’ of securities within the meaning of Rule 10b-5 is to be 
determined as the time when the parties to the transaction are committed to one another.” Radiation 
Dynamics, Inc. v. Goldmuntz, 464 F.2d 876, 891 (2d Cir. 1972). The Final Proxy indicates that 
shareholders had to commit to sale or appraisal pre-merger. It states: “Shareholders who elect to 
dissent from the Merger will have the right to receive payment of the fair value of their Shares if 

the Merger is completed, but only if they deliver to the Company, before the vote for the Merger 
is taken at the extraordinary general meeting, a written objection to the Merger and subsequently 
comply with all procedures and requirements of [the appropriate Cayman Islands Company Law] 
for the exercise of dissenters’ rights. . . .” ECF No. 45-1 at iv (emphasis added). Indeed, Plaintiff 
twice pleaded that he sold his shares on November 18, 2015, AC ¶¶ 31, 287, to which admission 
he is bound. Bellefonte Re Ins. Co. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 757 F.2d 523, 528 (2d Cir. 1985) (“A 
party’s assertion of fact in a pleading is a judicial admission by which it normally is bound . . . .”). 
The commitment to accept or appraise precedes the merger, and therefore the existence of the 
surviving corporation Shanda.                                             

   Aside from the timing argument, which is rendered implausible by the Final Proxy—a 
document on which Plaintiff repeatedly relies in its Amended Complaint—Plaintiff fails to plead 
facts that indicate why the purchase of Shanda shares by Capitalhold or Capitalcorp is also a 
purchase by Shanda. Because Plaintiff has failed to plead contemporaneous trading, both the 
Sections10b-5 and 20A insider trading claim are rightly dismissed. Since Plaintiff did not plead 
that Shanda engaged in insider trading, it also necessarily fails to plead that Shanda had a duty 
pursuant to insider trading law to disclose the Mir II Mobile data.       

   For these reasons, the Court finds Plaintiff failed to adequately plead these insider trading 
claims.                                                                   
3. Cayman Island Duty To Disclose Mir II Mobile Data                    

   The Court will also reconsider whether Cayman Island law required the disclosure of the
Mir II Mobile data, which argument the Opinion overlooked. Plaintiff has argued that, pursuant to 
Cayman  Island  law,  Shanda  had  a  duty  to  provide  Plaintiff  and  shareholders  “sufficient 
information” to understand the merger, including a “meaningful valuation”. Mot. at 16. This duty 
would, in turn, establish an element of Section 10b liability for Shanda’s failure to release the Mir 
II Mobile data as a pure omission. See Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 563 U.S. 27, 37–38 
(2011) (requiring (a) a material omission; (b) scienter (c) reliance; (d) a connection between the 
falsity and the purchase or sale of securities; and (e) economic loss).   
   Plaintiff pleads that “Cayman Islands corporations, like Shanda, have a duty to provide 
investors with sufficient information to adequately understand the Transaction that they are called 
upon to consider”. AC ¶ 290. In its briefing, Plaintiff proffers Davis v. Scottish Re Grp. Ltd., 159 
A.D.3d 528, 529, 74 (App. Div. 1st Dept) as authority on Cayman law. Plaintiff characterizes

Davis as indicating that under Cayman law “Shanda must provide its shareholders with ‘sufficient 
information’ to understand the merger, including a ‘meaningful valuation’ of their shares.” Mot. 
at 16. Not so.                                                            
   The portion of Davis on which Plaintiff relies does not support such an expansive duty. 
Rather, it says:                                                          

   “However, to the extent the director defendants gave shareholders an information 
   statement providing information and recommendations about the merger 
   transaction, they owed the shareholders a ‘sufficient information duty’ (Sharp v. Blank, 
   [2015] EWHC 3220 [Ch], ¶ 5). This is not a duty of loyalty, which would require the 
   directors to subordinate their interests to the shareholders' interests, but ‘if [the directors] 
   are going to invite the shareholders to a meeting, common fairness requires that they 
   explain what the purpose of the meeting is’ in a "clear and comprehensible’ manner (id. ¶ 
   21).”                                                                
Davis, 159 A.D.3d at 529-30 (emphasis added). This is not a statement about pure omission. It 
indicates that when directors make a statement, for example, by giving shareholders an information 
statement, they have a duty that it not be misleading.                    
   The cited portion of Davis indicates that Cayman Island law would ask whether the Final 
Proxy was misleading because it did not include the Mir II Mobile data. The Court has already 
concluded that “Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the omission was misleading”. Opinion at 
18-19. Plaintiff has not asked the Court to reconsider this assessment, nor does the Court see any
reason this question would come out differently under an analogous Cayman Island framework. 
    The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiffs allegation that said Cayman duty would give 
rise to an affirmative duty for Shanda to disclose the Mir II Mobile data is without merit. 

                                 CONCLUSION 

    For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is DENIED in part and 
GRANTED in part. The Court concludes that the reconsidered arguments lack merit. Consistent 
with the request from Plaintiff, the Court will issue a scheduling order to consider granting Plaintiff 
leave to amend. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motions at ECF Nos. 
66 and 68.
