  "summary_text": "Fort Worth Partners, LLC sued Nilfisk, Inc. and its parent company Nilfisk Holding A/S for breach of contract relating to Nilfisk\u2019s insurance obligations under the parties\u2019 lease agreement. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court denied Nilfisk\u2019s motion, granted Fort Worth Partners\u2019 motion in part, and held a bench trial on damages. Nilfisk appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment and the damages award. Fort Worth Partners cross-appeals the district court\u2019s damages award. We affirm, with the exception of the damages award pertaining to unrebutted costs, which we reverse and remand to the district court to make factual findings supporting its award."
