  "summary_text": "Appellant, who was convicted of a nonviolent financial felony, brings a Second Amendment and Fifth Amendment challenge to the felon-in-possession law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), which prohibits convicted felons from possessing firearms. He argues that because he was convicted only of a nonviolent financial felony, Congress cannot deprive him of his right to bear arms. He further asserts that because he has a constitutional right to bear arms, he also has a due process right to an individual assessment of dangerousness before the government can deprive him of his Second Amendment rights. Appellant now appeals the Southern District of New York\u2019s (Halpern, J.) dismissal of his claims. His appeal fails because (1) the Second Amendment does not prohibit Congress from disarming convicted felons; and (2) he has no right to individualized process prior to the application of a categorical criminal prohibition.\n\nAFFIRMED."
