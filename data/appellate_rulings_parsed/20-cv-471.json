  "summary_text": "Keisha Reynolds appeals from a March 16, 2023 judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Shea, J.) granting summary judgment in favor of CT Transit, her former employer. Reynolds filed claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq., alleging that she was discriminated against and wrongfully terminated on the basis of her religion and perceived disability. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the record of prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.\n\n\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo . . . resolv[ing] all ambiguities and draw[ing] all inferences against the moving party.\u201d Garcia v. Hartford Police Dep\u2019t, 706 F.3d 120, 126\u201327 (2d Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is proper only when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\u201d Id. at 126 (quotation marks omitted). But \u201cconclusory statements or mere allegations [are] not sufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.\u201d Penn v. N.Y. Methodist Hosp., 884 F.3d 416, 423 (2d Cir. 2018) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nOn appeal, Reynolds acknowledges that she did not meet her burden in opposing summary judgment on any of her claims. See Appellant\u2019s Br. 27\u201329, 33; see also Reynolds v. HNS Mgmt. Co., No. 20-CV-471, 2023 WL 2526532, at *9\u201311 (D. Conn. Mar. 15, 2023). Instead, she argues that the District Court erred in denying her request for appointment of pro bono counsel for purposes of opposing CT Transit\u2019s summary judgment motion and that, as a result, its summary judgment ruling was rendered on an incomplete record. We are not persuaded. \u201cA district court\u2019s decision not to request an attorney to represent an indigent civil plaintiff pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1) is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.\u201d Leftridge v. Conn. State Trooper Officer No. 1283, 640 F.3d 62, 68 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted). A district court has \u201c[b]road discretion . . . in deciding whether to appoint counsel pursuant to this provision.\u201d Hodge v. Police Officers, 802 F.2d 58, 60 (2d Cir. 1986)."
