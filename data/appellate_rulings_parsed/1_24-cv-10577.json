      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court held that most of the protestors' conduct was protected speech and not actionable harassment under Title VI, and that the few plausibly antisemitic incidents were not sufficiently severe, pervasive, or known to MIT to support liability."

      "standard_of_review": "de novo",
      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court found plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege that the student protestors conspired for the purpose of depriving Jewish and Israeli students of their civil rights, as required under \u00a7 1985(3), so the \u00a7 1986 claim necessarily failed."

  "summary_text": "This case emerges from a school year of tension among students, faculty, and administrators at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in response to extraordinary violence in the Middle East. Two plaintiffs are MIT students. The third is StandWithUs Center for Legal Justice, the legal arm of a California-based membership organization \"dedicated to combatting antisemitism.\" Together, plaintiffs allege that MIT failed to take sufficient action to curtail a surge of anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian student protests, thereby allegedly subjecting MIT's Jewish and Israeli students to antisemitic harassment. The district court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim. For the reasons that follow, we affirm."
