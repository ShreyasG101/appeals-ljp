  "summary_text": "This case looks like a standard claim under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) to recover benefits. But Derek Kramer wants to change the rules for these claims. Kramer believes he has a right to \u201cfull discovery,\u201d including documents subject to the attorney-client privilege, rather than an adjudication based on the administrative record. Kramer also thinks he has a constitutional right to a jury trial for his ERISA claim. And he seeks to apply a different standard to adjudicate his claim than the one we instructed district courts to use more than two decades ago. We reject Kramer\u2019s request to change the rules.\n\nOn the merits, Kramer has not shown that the district court erred in finding that the decision denying Kramer benefits was not arbitrary and capricious. We thus affirm."
