  "summary_text": "Approximately two years after Respondent-Appellant Jessica Silveira da Silva (\"Silveira\") brought her minor son (\"A.R.\") to the United States, A.R.'s father, Petitioner-Appellee Edervaldo Rodrigues da Silva (\"Rodrigues\"), initiated proceedings in federal court to return A.R. to Brazil under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (\"Hague Convention\"). After Rodrigues proved that A.R. had been wrongfully removed, Silveira invoked the \"now settled\" defense under the Hague Convention, asserting that A.R.'s extensive ties to the community in Lowell, Massachusetts, weighed against returning him to Brazil. The district court disagreed.\n\nOn appeal, Silveira argues that the district court committed both legal and factual errors, which mandate reversal. The district court engaged in a thorough analysis and \"grapple[d] with difficult factual circumstances in which no outcome may [have] appear[ed] ideal.\" Mendez v. May, 778 F.3d 337, 347 (1st Cir. 2015). Ultimately, we hold that it erred in concluding that A.R. is not settled in the United States. Accordingly, we vacate and remand."
