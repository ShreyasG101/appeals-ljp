      "key_reasoning": "The First Circuit reviewed the district court's summary judgment ruling de novo but found that the district court correctly applied the deferential abuse of discretion standard to the plan administrator's decision, and that substantial evidence supported USAble's determination that Bernitz was no longer disabled under the plan."

      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court found that while a structural conflict existed, USAble took sufficient steps to insulate its claims process (e.g., use of independent medical reviewers and a separate appeals unit), and there was no evidence of bias or procedural unreasonableness affecting the outcome."

  "summary_text": "Plaintiff-Appellant Steven Bernitz was Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Synta Pharmaceuticals (\"Synta\"). Bernitz has a long history of back problems, and in June 2014, he stopped working due to chronic back pain. For years thereafter, he received disability benefits under a long-term disability insurance plan administered by USAble Life (\"USAble\"). In 2019, however, USAble determined that Bernitz was no longer disabled due to various observed changes in Bernitz's lifestyle and medical condition, and accordingly terminated his benefits. The benefits termination started a lengthy phase of administrative reviews and litigation in federal court, which culminated in the district court below granting USAble's motion for summary judgment on all counts and leaving undisturbed USAble's initial decision to terminate Bernitz's benefits. We affirm."
