  "summary_text": "Plaintiff-Appellant David Monk challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 10(b) securities fraud case for failure to state a claim. Monk alleges that materially misleading proxy materials issued by Shanda Games Limited (\u201cShanda\u201d) as part of a freeze-out merger caused him to accept the merger price instead of exercising his appraisal rights. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Carter, J.) dismissed Monk\u2019s claims on the ground that he failed properly to allege loss causation. We hold that the district court erred in dismissing Monk\u2019s claims. We agree with the district court that City of Pontiac Policemen\u2019s and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System v. UBS AG, 752 F.3d 173 (2d Cir. 2014), created a limited exception (for foreign securities purchased on foreign exchanges) to the general rule, set forth in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247 (2010), that \u201ctransactions in securities listed on a domestic exchange\u201d fall within the scope of \u00a7 10(b), as this case does. City of Pontiac, 752 F.3d at 179-181 (quoting Morrison, 561 U.S. at 267). We further conclude that Monk has adequately alleged material misstatements; that federal law governs the adverse interest exception to imputation for scienter in \u00a7 10(b) cases; and that the scienter of the conflicted directors\u2014who had the motive and opportunity to deflate the merger price for their own financial gain\u2014can be imputed to the company. We also agree with the district court that Monk may invoke the rebuttable presumption of fraud-on-the-market to satisfy transaction causation because he relied on the market price to decide not to exercise his appraisal rights. We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion with respect to certain misrepresentations and on loss causation and hold that Monk adequately pleaded loss causation. We therefore AFFIRM in part and VACATE in part the judgment of the district court."
