      "standard_of_review": "clear error",
      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The district court did not clearly err in finding insufficient evidence that the ordinance had a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce, as it favored incumbents regardless of in-state or out-of-state status and no out-of-state enterprise was shown to be burdened."

      "standard_of_review": "abuse of discretion",
      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "Plaintiffs failed to articulate a concrete antitrust theory or likelihood of success on the merits, so the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying relief."

      "key_reasoning": "Even if plaintiffs had a property interest in a license, they failed to show a property interest in medallions, which are also required to operate, so no likelihood of success was shown."

      "key_reasoning": "The ordinance is rationally related to legitimate government interests in traffic and congestion, and thus survives rational basis review."

  "summary_text": "In 2023, James Broad and Rebecca McCrensky began operating a car-rental agency, Becky's Broncos, LLC (collectively with Broad and McCrensky, \"Becky's\"), without the requisite approval from local authorities -- the Town of Nantucket and Nantucket Town Select Board (collectively, \"Nantucket\"). Nantucket soon ordered Becky's to stop its unsanctioned car-rental operations, prompting Becky's to seek preliminary injunctive relief in the District of Massachusetts. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Becky's request."
