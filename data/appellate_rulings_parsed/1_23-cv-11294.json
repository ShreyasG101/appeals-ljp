  "summary_text": "The district court dismissed the amended complaint in full. See Doe v. City of Bos., No. CV 23-11294, 2024 WL 1346018, at *2 (D. Mass. Mar. 29, 2024). As relevant to this appeal, it dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claims against the BPD and DCF defendants after rejecting the argument that these defendants violated the Does' substantive due process rights by affirmatively enhancing the danger they faced from Rose. See id. at *12-16. The court then dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claims against the City based on its conclusion that the Does had not alleged any underlying constitutional violation by any city employee, and thus they could not meet the test for municipal liability under Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). See Doe, 2024 WL 1346018, at *16.\n\nAs for the \u00a7 1985 claims, the district court concluded that the Does did not sufficiently plead that the defendants were motivated by class-based animus to conspire and deprive John and Jane Doe of their civil rights. See id. at *16-17. Lastly, because the court dismissed all the federal claims, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. See id. at *17.\n\nThe Does timely appealed."
