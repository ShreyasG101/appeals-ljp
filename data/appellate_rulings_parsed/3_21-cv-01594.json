      "key_reasoning": "The First Circuit held that the 'substantial threat' element of OPA liability is not delegated to the Coast Guard for purposes of binding judicial review, and must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, not merely by showing the FOSC's determination was not arbitrary or capricious."

  "summary_text": "In this interlocutory appeal, we confront a challenge to a grant of summary judgment to the United States as to the issue of liability on its claims for damages under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\"OPA\"), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2701-2761. The claims name as defendants the owner and the insurer of an oil tanker that ran aground on the coast of Puerto Rico. We conclude that we have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3) because this case \"includes an admiralty . . . claim.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(h)(2). We further conclude, with respect to the appeal's merits, that the defendants are right that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the United States as to the issue of liability. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court's decision in part, reverse the District Court's grant of partial summary judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion."
