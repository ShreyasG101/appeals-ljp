  "summary_text": "PER CURIAM. Chapter 13 debtor-appellant Mary E. Buscone appeals from an order rejecting her objection to a proof of claim for a Massachusetts state-court judgment that Buscone owes to appellee Ann Tracy Botelho. Through an adversary proceeding in Buscone's previous Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Botelho sought a determination that her judgment against Buscone was excepted from discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(4). Because of discovery abuse by Buscone and her counsel in that proceeding, the bankruptcy court entered default judgment for Botelho. Now in her second bankruptcy, this time under Chapter 13, Buscone objects to Botelho's proof of claim for that debt on the same grounds raised previously and, alternatively, asserts that the interest rate and accrual date prescribed by Massachusetts state law should not apply to the Massachusetts state-court judgment. We affirm."
