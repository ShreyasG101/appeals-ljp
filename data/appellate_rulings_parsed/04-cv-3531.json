  "summary_text": "Plaintiff-Counter-Defendant-Appellant Advanced Analytics, Inc. (\u201cAAI\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s entry of partial summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Counter-Claimants-Appellees Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (\u201cCGMI\u201d) and The Yield Book, Inc. (\u201cTYB\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) on AAI\u2019s claims of misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. AAI also appeals the district court\u2019s grant of only nominal damages to AAI on the limited breach of contract claim on which it prevailed.\n\nAAI generally alleges that, during unsuccessful licensing negotiations conducted in the 1990s, CGMI misappropriated a proprietary numerical sequence (the \u201cACE Numbers\u201d) developed by AAI\u2019s principal, Dr. Xiaolu Wang, and later incorporated elements of that sequence into its own software, TYB, generating significant profits without compensating AAI. After nearly twenty years of litigation, including two rounds of discovery spanning approximately five years, the district court found that CGMI had produced unrebutted evidence of independent development of its software and that AAI had failed to introduce evidence showing that CGMI\u2019s software incorporated or was derived from AAI\u2019s ACE Numbers. Accordingly, the district court granted summary judgment to Defendants on the misappropriation of trade secrets claim (and the contract and quasi-contract claims premised on the same contentions). The district court also found that CGMI breached a nondisclosure agreement with AAI (the \u201cNDA\u201d) in a limited fashion but awarded only nominal damages, citing AAI\u2019s failure to proffer evidence of any resulting damages. Finally, the district court granted CGMI\u2019s counterclaim for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs as the prevailing party under the NDA and denied several motions to reconsider its various rulings.\n\nOn appeal, AAI\u2019s briefing is at points difficult to understand \u2013 so much so that Defendants urge us to affirm on the ground that AAI has \u201cfailed to satisfy its burden to set out identifiable legal arguments\u201d at all. Appellee Br. 26, citing Ernst Haas Studio, Inc. v. Palm Press, Inc., 164 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir. 1999). Nevertheless, we have done our best to decipher and address AAI\u2019s intended arguments, including what we perceive to be its challenges to: (1) various discovery rulings, (2) the grant of summary judgment to CGMI on the misappropriation claim, (3) the award of only nominal damages on the breach of contract claim, and (4) the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to CGMI."
