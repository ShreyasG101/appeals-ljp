  "summary_text": "Appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Stein, J.) dismissing plaintiff-appellant's claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which alleged that defendant-appellee bank failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into her dispute claiming identity theft committed by her mother. Plaintiff contends that a reasonable investigation would have led to a finding that the account was fraudulent. The district court granted summary judgment to the bank, concluding first that, putting aside the actual reasonableness of the bank's investigation, no reasonable investigation required by the statute would have yielded a different result; and second that plaintiff did not present any triable issues of fact as to whether the bank willfully or negligently violated the statute so as to be liable to her for damages.\n\nAFFIRMED."
