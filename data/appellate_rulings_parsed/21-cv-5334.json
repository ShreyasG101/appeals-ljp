      "holding": "AFFIRM",

  "summary_text": "Plaintiffs-Appellants brought pre-enforcement Second Amendment challenges to certain aspects of New York State\u2019s (\u201cNew York\u201d or the \u201cState\u201d) concealed carry license regime. As relevant to this appeal, Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of: (1) the prohibition on carrying firearms in \u201csensitive locations\u201d\u2014namely, Times Square, the New York City (the \u201cCity\u201d) subway system, and the Metro-North rail system, see N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 265.01-e(2)(t), (2)(n); (2) New York\u2019s ban on open carry, see id. \u00a7 400.00(15); and (3) the requirement that a State concealed carry license holder apply for and receive a City-specific permit in order to carry a firearm in the City, see id. \u00a7 400.00(6). Plaintiffs filed a motion to preliminarily enjoin the enforcement of those provisions, which the district court denied in a March 13, 2023 order. On this appeal from that order, we conclude that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits because, based on the preliminary record before us, the government has demonstrated that each of the challenged provisions falls within our Nation\u2019s historical tradition of gun regulations and, thus, does not violate the Second Amendment. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court."
