  "summary_text": "Martin Flanagan brought this qui tam suit against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc. (\"Fresenius\"), under the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729, alleging a fraudulent kickback scheme related to referrals to Fresenius-operated dialysis clinics. The district court dismissed Flanagan's complaint for failing to meet the heightened pleading standard under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, among other reasons. When Flanagan then sought leave to amend his complaint, the district court also denied that motion. Flanagan now appeals these decisions, arguing that the complaint satisfied the heightened pleading standard necessary to assert fraud claims and that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for leave to amend. For the reasons that follow, we affirm both decisions of the district court."
