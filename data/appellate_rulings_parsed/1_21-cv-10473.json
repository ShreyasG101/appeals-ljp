  "summary_text": "GELP\u00cd, Circuit Judge. Justin and Jared Brackett own and operate two restaurants in the Town of Harwich, Massachusetts (\"Harwich\"): Ember Pizza, Inc. (\"Ember\") and The Port Restaurant and Bar, Inc. (\"The Port\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs-Appellants\" or \"Ember and The Port\"). Ember and The Port held liquor and entertainment licenses issued by Harwich. But they allegedly committed a series of violations of Harwich's noise ordinance and Massachusetts COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in suspensions of and restrictions on their permits. In response to these suspensions, Ember and The Port sued Harwich, multiple Harwich officials, and other individuals in federal district court. In their amended complaint (hereinafter, the \"complaint\"), Ember and The Port asserted various federal and state claims. The defendants filed several dispositive motions, which the district court largely granted. When all was said and done, Ember and The Port's claims had all been rejected, and having found that an amendment would be futile, the district court denied Ember and The Port's request for leave to amend their complaint. This appeal followed. We affirm."
