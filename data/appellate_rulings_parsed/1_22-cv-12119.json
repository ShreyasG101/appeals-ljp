      "standard_of_review": "de novo",
      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court found no genuine dispute of material fact that accommodating Melino's request would impose an undue hardship, as BMC relied on CDC guidance and no medical evidence in the record contradicted the efficacy of the vaccines. Melino's arguments and evidence did not create a triable issue."

      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court held that denial was proper because Melino failed to comply with the local rule requiring conferral before filing, and the challenged affidavit statements were not hearsay as they were offered to show BMC's motive, not for the truth of the matter asserted."

  "summary_text": "Alexandra Melino, a registered nurse, sued her former employer, Boston Medical Center (BMC), alleging that BMC violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B by denying her request for a religious exemption under its August 21, 2021 policy mandating that all employees and volunteers be vaccinated against COVID-19. The district court granted summary judgment to BMC, holding that Melino's requested exemption would have imposed undue hardship on her employer. See Melino v. Bos. Med. Ctr., No. 22-12119, 2024 WL 2724145, at *1-2 (D. Mass. May 28, 2024). Melino appeals both the grant of summary judgment and an order denying her motion to strike portions of an affidavit submitted by BMC. We affirm."
