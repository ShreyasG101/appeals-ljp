  "summary_text": "This case arises out of a traffic stop in Manchester, New Hampshire, which escalated into a physical struggle between several police officers and Brandon Velez. After Velez did not immediately comply with orders to step out of his vehicle, two officers physically attempted to remove him and overcome his firm resistance. In the process, one officer struck Velez four times and tased him twice. Velez later sued several of the officers and the City of Manchester (the \"City\") under federal and state common law for injuries he sustained during the incident. In response, they filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. Velez now appeals. While we conclude that one of the officers used excessive force, we affirm the district court on all counts."
