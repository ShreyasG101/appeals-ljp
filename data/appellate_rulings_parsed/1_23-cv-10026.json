  "summary_text": "This appeal arises from a police confrontation that resulted in the fatal shooting of a man in his Newton, Massachusetts apartment building. The incident began when the Newton Police Department (NPD) received a report that Michael Conlon was attempting an armed robbery of a candy store adjacent to his apartment building. It ended approximately thirty minutes later when Conlon, who was suffering a mental-health crisis, was shot dead by two officers on scene.\n\nPlaintiffs -- Conlon's parents serving as the representatives of their son's estate -- sued the City of Newton and several of its police officers, asserting claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Title II of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, and Massachusetts law. The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint entirely and entered judgment. We vacate the judgment as to Plaintiffs' section 1983 claims against the police officers' use of lethal force and remand the matter for further proceedings on that claim. The remainder of the judgment is affirmed."
