      "key_reasoning": "The court held that under Massachusetts law, the debtor's equity of redemption was extinguished at the foreclosure sale upon execution of the memorandum of sale, and the properly recorded affidavit of sale provided constructive notice of this extinguishment to a hypothetical bona fide purchaser, precluding avoidance under \u00a7 544(a)(3)."

Under the \"strong arm\" provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(a)(3), the debtor, Andy Luu Tran, seeks to avoid the transfer of his interest in his Massachusetts home (the \"Property\") because the foreclosure deed was recorded without an accompanying certificate of acknowledgment. The bankruptcy court granted summary judgment against Tran; the district court affirmed. Tran timely appealed. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court."
