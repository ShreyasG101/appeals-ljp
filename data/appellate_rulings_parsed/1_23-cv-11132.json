  "summary_text": "Lead plaintiff State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio (\"State Teachers\") and other investors of defendant Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (\"Charles River\") brought this securities-fraud class action alleging that Charles River and two of its officers misled investors as to the integrity of the overseas supply chain undergirding its supply of long-tailed macaques -- a central part of the company's business. Charles River moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court agreed that State Teachers had failed to allege false or misleading statements as well as scienter; thus, without reaching any further issues, the district court dismissed the action. State Teachers timely appealed.\n\nFor the following reasons, we agree with State Teachers that it plausibly alleged that Charles River knowingly or recklessly misled investors as to problems lurking in its supply chain. We therefore reverse the district court's dismissal of the complaint as to one set of misleading statements. And we remand for the district court to consider in the first instance whether State Teachers plausibly alleged that any of its losses were caused by Charles River's misdirection."
