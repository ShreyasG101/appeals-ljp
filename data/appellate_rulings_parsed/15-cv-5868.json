      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court found the contract language unambiguous in barring Wood from claiming the Decedent\u2019s pension and annuity benefits, and thus her acceptance of those benefits constituted a breach. The Estate was entitled to summary judgment."

      "description": "Whether the district court correctly determined that the Decedent\u2019s father was an intended third-party beneficiary of the Property Settlement Agreement (PSA), and that the Estate, as assignee, was entitled to damages.",
      "standard_of_review": "de novo",
      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court held that New Jersey law does not require the beneficiary to be specifically named, and the PSA\u2019s language and circumstances showed intent to benefit a third party, making the Decedent\u2019s father a third-party beneficiary whose claim could be assigned to the Estate."

      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court found no exceptional circumstances warranting tolling; delays were part of normal litigation and the Estate\u2019s request to reopen discovery was made in good faith and granted by the court."
