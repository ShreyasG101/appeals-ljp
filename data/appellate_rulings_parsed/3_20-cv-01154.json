  "summary_text": "\u00c1NGEL FORTEZA-GARC\u00cdA appeals the District Court's denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition for post-conviction relief, in which he seeks relief from his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j). That provision makes it a crime to \"cause the death of a person through the use of a firearm\" in the course of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which in turn criminalizes using or carrying a firearm \"during and in relation to any crime of violence.\" Forteza based his petition on United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. 445 (2019), which held unconstitutionally vague a portion of the definition of a \"crime of violence\" in \u00a7 924(c). Forteza contends that, in consequence of Davis, the predicate conviction for his \u00a7 924(j) offense does not qualify as a \"crime of violence,\" and thus that his conviction for that offense is unconstitutional. We disagree and affirm."
