      "key_reasoning": "The court held that the 24-month mental-health limitation applies only if the claimant\u2019s physical disabilities alone do not cause total disability; since McEachin\u2019s physical disabilities alone justified benefits before April 2021, the limitation did not start until then."

  "summary_text": "For nearly four years, Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co. paid total disability benefits to Annette McEachin. It stopped the payments when McEachin\u2019s physical health improved. McEachin sued the insurance company under ERISA, more fully known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The district court agreed with Reliance that McEachin no longer had a physical disability but found that her ongoing mental-health disabilities entitled her to two more years of benefits. We vacate in part, affirm in part, and remand the case to the district court."
