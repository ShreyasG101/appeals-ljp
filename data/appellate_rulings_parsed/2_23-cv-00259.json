  "summary_text": "These consolidated appeals challenge the dismissals of two diversity actions brought by hospitals incorporated and operating in Mexico (together, the \"Hospitals\") against Martin's Point Health Care, Inc. (\"Martin's Point\"), a Maine health insurance company. The district court dismissed both actions for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, concluding that the Hospitals' negligent-misrepresentation and promissory-estoppel claims arose under the Medicare Act, such that the Hospitals were required to exhaust administrative remedies before suing Martin's Point in federal court. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g)-(h), 1395w-22(g)(5), 1395ii. On appeal, the Hospitals contend that they were not required to exhaust administrative remedies because their claims do not arise under the Medicare Act. Alternatively, they argue that they should have been exempted from the exhaustion requirement because, as foreign hospitals, they cannot participate in Medicare's administrative-remedies process. We affirm."
