  "summary_text": "This is a land use dispute between a developer and local government authorities concerning the restoration of a property that has been designated as a historical landmark. The developer argues that the local government violated its federal constitutional rights by forcing it to stop restoring the property. Because this dispute could be substantially narrowed or mooted by the resolution of state-law issues presently pending in state court, we decline to reach the merits at this time and instead direct the district court to stay the suit while the state-court proceedings are ongoing."
