  "summary_text": "Ernst Theodore Tenemille, pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his employment discrimination action and the denial of his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motion for reconsideration. Tenemille commenced this action against the Town of Ramapo (the \u201cTown\u201d), the Town of Ramapo Police Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) (his former employer), and Town and Department officials, alleging discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, culminating in his December 2016 termination, allegedly in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and several state law provisions.\n\nTenemille\u2019s pro se fourth amended complaint alleged that he was employed by the Department as a police officer from August 2002 until December 2016. In November 2015, Tenemille was investigated by the Police Department for submitting allegedly improper sick notes for absences due to a minor injury, culminating in his termination on December 16, 2016. Tenemille alleged that the investigation and his termination were due to discrimination based on his national origin and/or his race, and as retaliation for his protected activity of questioning the Defendants\u2019 access of his private medical information.\n\nThe defendants moved, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), to dismiss the fourth amended complaint as time-barred and for failure to state a claim. In January 2022, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, reasoning that some of Tenemille\u2019s allegations were time-barred, and that his timely allegations failed to state a claim. The court granted Tenemille 30 days to file a fifth amended complaint.\n\nIn lieu of amending, Tenemille moved for reconsideration. The district court construed the motion under Rule 60(b) and denied it, concluding that relief was not warranted. Tenemille timely appealed the district court\u2019s judgment and the denial of his motion for reconsideration."
