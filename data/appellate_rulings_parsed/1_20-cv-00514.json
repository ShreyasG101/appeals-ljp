  "summary_text": "Elizabeth Warner is a federal postal employee who was passed over for two promotions. Believing that she was denied those positions because of her age and sex, she sued her employer, the United States Postal Service (USPS). Warner alleged that USPS discriminated against her in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The district court granted summary judgment against her. It held that no reasonable jury could conclude that USPS's stated reasons for denying Warner the promotions were, in fact, pretexts for discrimination.\n\nWe agree that Warner's claims of age discrimination fail as a matter of law. However, we find that the evidence presents a genuine dispute of material fact as to one of her sex-discrimination claims. We therefore affirm in part, and reverse in part, the district court's summary judgment order. Our reasoning follows."
