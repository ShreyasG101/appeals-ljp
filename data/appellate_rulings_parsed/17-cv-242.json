      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court held that Plaintiffs failed to show that Q-Pod conditions imposed an atypical and significant hardship under clearly established law, so qualified immunity was appropriate."

  "summary_text": "Nine Connecticut inmates claim that their confinement in a special housing unit called Q-Pod violated their constitutional rights. They sued prison officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging violations of their First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The district court (Chatigny, J.) granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on qualified-immunity grounds.\n\nWe affirm as to Plaintiffs\u2019 Eighth Amendment and procedural due process claims, as well as the free exercise claims of seven of the nine Plaintiffs. But we reverse as to two Plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise claims alleging that Defendants denied their requests to participate in Native American sweat lodge and smudging practices, which are congregate religious services. Defendants offered no penological justification for the denials\u2014not to Plaintiffs, the district court, or this Court\u2014so their refusal to permit participation in religious congregation violated clearly established law. The judgment and order of the district court are AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part and the case is REMANDED with instructions to deny Defendants\u2019 motion as to Joe Baltas\u2019s and Joseph Tarasco\u2019s denial-of-congregation claims. We also VACATE the dismissal of Baltas\u2019s and Tarasco\u2019s state-law claims."
