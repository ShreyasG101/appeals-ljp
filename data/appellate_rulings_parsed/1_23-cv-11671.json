      "key_reasoning": "The First Circuit held there is no requirement for district courts to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a Rule 12 motion, and thus found no procedural error."

      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court found that plaintiffs had adequate notice and opportunity to respond, discovery was sufficient, and the legal issues were fully briefed, making sua sponte summary judgment appropriate."

      "holding": "AFFIRM",
      "key_reasoning": "The court found insufficient evidence of discriminatory purpose or effect, and held that under National Pork, the Act\u2019s evenhanded regulation of in-state sales does not violate the dormant Commerce Clause, nor does it impose a substantial burden under Pike."

  "summary_text": "GELP\u00cd, Circuit Judge. In 2016, Massachusetts passed the Act to Prevent Cruelty to Farm Animals (the \"Massachusetts Act\"). As relevant here, the Massachusetts Act prohibits the use of certain methods of confinement (\"gestation crates\") on pig farms in Massachusetts. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 129, App. \u00a7 1-2. It also prohibits the sale, in Massachusetts, of pork products derived from pigs who were confined in gestation crates. See id. \u00a7 1-3. Plaintiffs are out-of-Massachusetts pig farmers and the slaughterhouse those farmers co-own (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). They sued to challenge the Massachusetts Act, chiefly arguing that it violated the dormant Commerce Clause and that it was preempted by federal law. The district court disagreed, first dismissing most of the claims and later entering summary judgment against Plaintiffs on the remaining dormant Commerce Clause claim. We affirm the district court's rulings."
