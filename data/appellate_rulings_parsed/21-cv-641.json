  "summary_text": "Plaintiffs, the parents of students with disabilities, appeal from nineteen separate judgments of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York awarding attorneys\u2019 fees under the fee-shifting provision of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B)(i)(I), (i)(3)(C). Plaintiffs, represented by the Cuddy Law Firm (\u201cCLF\u201d), prevailed in their administrative actions to enforce their children\u2019s rights under the IDEA. CLF then sought to recover fees and costs from the New York City Department of Education (\u201cNYCDOE\u201d) under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415. After failing to reach agreement with the NYCDOE, Plaintiffs sued in federal court to recover the fees. The District Court calculated a reasonable fee award in each of the actions, but Plaintiffs challenge each award on appeal. A separate opinion filed simultaneously with this summary order resolves the NYCDOE\u2019s cross appeal in N.G.B. v. New York City Department of Education, 23-764-cv. 1 As to the Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the record of prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm."
