  "summary_text": "BARRON, Chief Judge. More than a century ago, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Sherman Act does not apply to '[t]he business [of] giving exhibitions of base ball [sic].' Fed. Baseball Club of Balt. v. Nat'l League of Pro. Base Ball Clubs, 259 U.S. 200, 208 (1922). Since then, the Court has acknowledged the 'aberration[al]' and 'anomal[ous]' nature of the so-called 'business of baseball' exemption from this federal antitrust statute. Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U.S. 258, 282, 285 (1972). The Court also has acknowledged the persistent criticism that shielding this 'business' from that statute's reach is 'unrealistic, inconsistent, or illogical.' Id. at 282 (quoting Radovich v. Nat'l Football League, 352 U.S. 445, 452 (1957)). Nonetheless, the Court has 'voiced a preference that if any change is to be made, it come by legislative action.' Id. at 283. The exemption thus remains in place.\n\nThere are questions, however, about the exemption's scope -- questions that are at the heart of this appeal. It arises from a suit by the former owner-operator of a franchise in a professional baseball league in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and two limited liability corporations of which he is the sole member. The plaintiffs named as the defendants, among others, the league's president, the league itself, and the owners of the league's other franchises. The plaintiffs allege that, in forcing the former owner of the franchise to relinquish his control over and interest in that franchise, the defendants violated the Sherman Act, a federal civil rights statute, Puerto Rico antitrust law, Puerto Rico fair competition law, and a Puerto Rico tort statute.\n\nThe United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico dismissed the plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims based on the 'business of baseball' exemption. It further ruled that the plaintiffs' claims under Puerto Rico's antitrust and fair competition laws were preempted precisely because those claims alleged conduct that constituted the 'business of baseball.' The District Court also dismissed on res judicata grounds the plaintiffs' remaining federal claim, which was brought pursuant to a federal civil rights law. The District Court then exercised its discretion to dismiss the plaintiffs' other Puerto Rico law claim, which was before it based on supplemental jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.\n\nWe agree with the District Court that the 'business of baseball' exemption applies to the Puerto Rico professional baseball league involved in this suit. We also agree that the exemption applies to the conduct that the plaintiffs allege violated the Sherman Act. We thus affirm the dismissal of the Sherman Act claims.\n\nWe do not agree, however, with the reason that the District Court gave for dismissing the Puerto Rico antitrust or fair competition claims, which was that they must be dismissed as preempted under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. Nor do we agree with the District Court that res judicata precludes the plaintiffs' federal civil rights claim. We therefore vacate the District Court's ruling dismissing the Puerto Rico antitrust and fair competition claims and reverse its ruling dismissing the federal civil rights claim. Moreover, because we reverse the District Court's ruling dismissing the plaintiffs' federal civil rights claim, we also must reverse its ruling dismissing the remaining Puerto Rico law claim."
