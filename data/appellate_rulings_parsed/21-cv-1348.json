      "key_reasoning": "The court held that Section 898 falls within PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception because it expressly regulates firearms, and thus is not preempted. The statute is not expressly or impliedly preempted, as it can be applied in a manner consistent with PLCAA\u2019s requirements."

  "summary_text": "National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association of manufacturers and wholesalers of firearms, and fourteen of its members, appeal from an order and judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (D\u2019Agostino, J.) dismissing their complaint challenging New York\u2019s gun-related public nuisance statute, N.Y. General Business Law \u00a7 898-a\u2013e, which imposes liability for gun industry members who knowingly or recklessly endanger the safety or health of the public through their sale or marketing of firearms. The complaint alleges that Section 898 is unconstitutional because it is preempted by the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (\u201cPLCAA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901\u20137903, violates the dormant Commerce Clause, and is so vague as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court granted judgment in favor of New York\u2019s Attorney General, Letitia James, in her official capacity, because it determined that Section 898 was neither preempted by PLCAA nor constitutionally infirm. On appeal, we find that Plaintiffs-Appellants have not met their burden in this facial, preenforcement challenge to demonstrate that Section 898 is unenforceable in all its applications. We further conclude that, on its face, Section 898: (1) falls within PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception clause and thus is not preempted, (2) does not violate the principles of interstate commerce, and (3) is not void for vagueness. Therefore, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court."
