reason_for_appeal: '=== Alicia Lowe; Debra Chalmers; Jennifer Barbalias; Garth Berenyi; Nicole Giroux; Adam Jones; Natalie Salavarria (Plaintiffs, Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in dismissing their constitutional challenge to Maine''s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for certain healthcare workers as moot, contending that the case was not moot despite the repeal of the mandate.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court incorrectly concluded they had not mounted a facial challenge to the statute authorizing the vaccine mandate and its exemptions, asserting that their challenge was not limited to an as-applied challenge to the repealed regulation.

  3. Appellants argued that the voluntary cessation exception to mootness applied because the defendants repealed the mandate in bad faith and as a litigation tactic to avoid judicial review after the First Circuit reinstated their claims.

  4. Appellants contended that the capable of repetition yet evading review exception to mootness applied, asserting that there was a reasonable expectation that they would be subject to the same or a substantially similar COVID-19 vaccination requirement in the future.

  5. Appellants argued that the district court erred in denying them leave to amend their complaint to broaden the scope of their claims to challenge all possible applications of the healthcare worker immunization rule and the authorizing statute, and to add a facial challenge.'
