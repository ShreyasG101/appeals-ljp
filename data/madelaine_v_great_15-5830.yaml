outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Madelaine Chocolate Novelties, Inc.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the evidence offered by Great Northern did not satisfy its burden under New York law to show that its construction of the policy was the only reasonable interpretation, and thus the district court erred in denying judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred by permitting the jury to consider evidence of Great Northern’s uncommunicated subjective intent regarding the meaning of the insurance policy.

  3. Appellant asserted that, under the law-of-the-case doctrine, the district court should not have permitted Great Northern to offer its interpretation of the Windstorm Endorsement at trial, specifically that it only modified deductibles and waiting periods and did not supersede the Flood Exclusion.

  4. Appellant argued that the district court erred in denying its motion for a new trial under Rule 59 because the jury’s verdict was allegedly based on improper evidence and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.'
