outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== James R. Edwards''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting Guardian Life Insurance''s motion for partial summary judgment on the basis that ERISA governed the policy and preempted his Mississippi common-law claims.

  2. Appellant contended, in the alternative, that even if ERISA applied, he was entitled to recover benefits under the plan because Guardian improperly denied his claim for life insurance proceeds.'
