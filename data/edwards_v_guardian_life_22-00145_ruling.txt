GUARDIAN LIFE INSURANCE OF AMERICA                                      DEFENDANT


                                       ORDER

       Before the Court is Defendant Guardian Life Insurance of America’s

(“Guardian”) [50] Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court grants the motion.

I.     Background

       This case arises from Plaintiff James “Jimmy” Emmett Edwards’s (Edwards)

attempt to recover $85,000 in group life insurance proceeds following the death of

his wife, Pam Edwards (Mrs. Edwards). See Compl. [1].

       Mrs. Edwards owned and operated Allure Salon in Starkville, Mississippi.

See Pl.’s Resp. [55] at 1; Admin. R. [43-1] at 91−92. In December 2007, Guardian

issued Allure Salon a group life insurance plan that covered Mrs. Edwards and

three other full-time salon technicians. See [43-1] at 105; see also id. at 91 (showing

insurance application with Allure Salon as Planholder and coverage for four

employees). “In subsequent years, new employees were added[,] and others were

removed.” Wiltrout Decl. [12-1] ¶ 12. “From January 15, 2015 through November

14, 2019, employee benefits were provided to three employees, including . . . [Mrs.]

Edwards.” Id. The plan’s terms granted Guardian the right to cancel the plan on the
    Case: 1:22-cv-00145-KHJ-MTP Doc #: 58 Filed: 07/12/24 2 of 14 PageID #: 545




“policy anniversary date or premium due date” if “less than two employees are

insured.” [43-1] at 3.

       Mrs. Edwards was diagnosed with cancer in 2019. [55] at 2. Later that year,

in November 2019, she became the only participating employee under the group

plan. Id. She still maintained the plan and pay monthly premiums. See id.

       Then in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. [51] at

3. Guardian chose to “suspend[] its practice of terminating plans that had dropped

to one participant . . . from September 2020 through October 2021.” Id. (citing [12-1]

¶ 20; [43-1] at 68−75). Once the suspension ended, Guardian mailed a

prenotification of cancellation letter to Allure Salon and Mrs. Edwards. Id. (citing

[43-1] at 168; Jansen Decl. [12-3] ¶¶ 4−5; [12-1] ¶ 21). Guardian sent a final

cancellation letter on December 31, 2021, stating the “group plan is being cancel[ed]

effective January 15, 2022” because of low group participation. Id. at 4 (citing [43-1]

at 169); see also id. at 3. “After the Allure Group Plan had been cancel[ed],

Guardian did not . . . receive any additional premiums from Allure [Salon].” Id. at 4

(citing [12-1] ¶ 23).

       Mrs. Edwards passed away on May 27, 2022. [1] ¶ 4. At that point, Debbie

Jaudon—the insurance agent who sold the group policy to Allure Salon—told

Edwards that his wife had a life insurance policy. See Jaudon Aff. [17-2] at 2.

Jaudon then “contacted Guardian to get a life claim form[, but] . . . they informed

[her] the policy had been cancel[ed].” Id. Guardian then sent Jaudon the

“cancellation notices that it claimed it had sent [Mrs. Edwards] before her death.”



                                           2
      Case: 1:22-cv-00145-KHJ-MTP Doc #: 58 Filed: 07/12/24 3 of 14 PageID #: 546




Id. Jaudon claims that she did not receive these cancellation notices before Mrs.

Edwards’s death and that “[i]n the insurance business, it is customary that an

agent such as [Jaudon] will receive notice of any cancellation.” Id.

        On October 4, 2022, Edwards sued for state-law claims for insufficient notice

and wrongful cancellation or, in the alternative, recovery of plan benefits under 29

U.S.C. § 1132(a). See [1] ¶¶ 9−12.

II.     Procedural History

        Guardian previously moved for partial summary judgment on Edwards’s

state-law claims, arguing ERISA preempted them. Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Partial

Summ. J. [13] at 1. The parties disagreed on whether the salon technicians were

employees or independent contractors and whether ERISA applied. See id. at 1−10;

Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n Mot. Partial Summ. J. [18]. The Court held that the technicians

were employees and that the insurance policy was an ERISA-governed employee

benefit plan. See Order Granting Partial Summ. J. [34] at 16 (“The circumstances

show that the Guardian-issued life insurance policy is an ERISA plan.”). It also held

that, because ERISA preempted Edwards’s state-law claims, “only his claim for

benefits under ERISA [would] proceed.” Id. at 23. 1

        Guardian now moves for summary judgment on Edwards’s “remaining claim

for benefits under ERISA.” [50] at 1. The Court considers Guardian’s motion below.




        1 In a subsequent Order, the Court allowed Edwards to conduct limited discovery

related to his remaining ERISA claim. See [47].

III.     Standard

         “Standard summary judgment rules control in ERISA cases.” Talasek v. Nat’l

Oilwell Varco, L.P., 16 F.4th 164, 168 (5th Cir. 2021) (quotation omitted). Summary

judgment is appropriate if the movant shows “no genuine dispute as to any material

fact” exists, and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ.

P. 56(a). “A fact is material if it ‘might affect the outcome of the suit under the

governing law,’ while a dispute about that fact is genuine ‘if the evidence is such

that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.’” Owens v.

Circassia Pharms., Inc., 33 F.4th 814, 824 (5th Cir. 2022) (citation omitted). The

Court “view[s] the evidence introduced and all factual inferences from the evidence

in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment[, but a] party

opposing summary judgment may not rest on mere conclusory allegations or denials

in its pleadings.” Smith v. Reg’l Transit Auth., 827 F.3d 412, 417 (5th Cir. 2016)

(quoting Hightower v. Tex. Hosp. Ass’n, 65 F.3d 443, 447 (5th Cir. 1995)).

IV.      Analysis

         Only Edwards’s claim under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) remains. 2 Because §

1132(a)(1)(B) does not allow recovery here, the Court grants Guardian’s motion for

summary judgment.




         2 Although Edwards cites generally to 29 U.S.C. § 1132 and 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a), he

really seeks relief under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B). His Complaint recites only the language
of § 1132(a)(1)(B) as a basis for ERISA recovery. See [1] ¶ 12. Further, “[w]hen a beneficiary
simply wants what was supposed to have been distributed under the plan, the appropriate
remedy is [§ 1132](a)(1)(B).” Hager v. DBG Partners, Inc., 903 F.3d 460, 469 (5th Cir. 2018)
(quotation omitted). Edwards tries only to recover “what was supposed to have been
distributed under the plan.” See id.; see also [1] ¶ 12 (seeking recovery of “the policy proceeds

                                               4
    Case: 1:22-cv-00145-KHJ-MTP Doc #: 58 Filed: 07/12/24 5 of 14 PageID #: 548




       Section 1132(a)(1)(B) allows a plaintiff to bring a civil action “to recover

benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the

terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the

plan.” Hager v. DBG Partners, Inc., 903 F.3d 460, 469 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting

29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B)). But that section does not allow recovery when “the plan

no longer exist[s] and c[an] no longer function.” Id. at 469 n.43 (quoting McCormack

v. Comput. Scis. Corp., 99 F. App’x 458, 463 (4th Cir. 2004)). 3

       Here, Guardian canceled the Allure Group Plan before Mrs. Edwards’s death

and before Edwards made a claim under the policy. Without a plan in existence,

Edwards “has no claim for benefits under the plan.” Id. at 465.

       Still, Edwards seeks to recover benefits from the canceled plan alleging that

Guardian (1) “waived its right to cancel the [p]lan for falling under the required

participation level”; and (2) “did not properly provide notice and give [Mrs.

Edwards] the opportunity to convert to individual life insurance as allowed by the

plan.” [55] at 5−6. 4 As explained below, these arguments do not prevent summary

judgment.


of $85,000.00”); [55] at 5 (“Plaintiff is entitled to recover plan benefits.”). The Court is
therefore sure that Edwards seeks relief under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).
       3   See also Maccarone v. Lineage L., LLC, No. 17-212, 2018 WL 6579161, at *4 (M.D.
La. Dec. 13, 2018) (“Plaintiff cannot bring a claim under Section 1132(a)(1)(B) because [the]
. . . plan has been terminated.”); Hanson v. Wilcox Veterinary Clinic PLLC, 596 F. Supp. 3d
742, 751 (E.D. Tex. 2021) (“Plaintiffs are no longer members of their former employer’s plans
because the plans no longer exist. Accordingly, any claim to recover those plan benefits is
foreclosed under § 1132(a)(1)(B).”).
       4
         Edwards also argues that he is “entitled to recover plan benefits under 29 U.S.C. §
1132” because the Mississippi Supreme Court’s decision in Gulf Guaranty Life Insurance Co.
v. Kelley, 389 So. 2d 920 (Miss. 1980), “barred [Guardian] from terminating the Plan since
Pam Edwards’[s] life was uninsurable.” [55] at 5; see also id. at 3 (arguing that Kelley

       A. Waiver

       To begin, the parties do not dispute that the plan granted Guardian

discretionary authority to determine benefit eligibility and an absolute right to

cancel the policy in some cases:

       Guardian is the Claims Fiduciary with discretionary authority to
       interpret and construe the terms of the Policy, the Certificate, the
       Schedule of Benefits, and any riders, or other documents or forms that
       may be attached to the Certificate or the Policy, and any other plan
       documents. Guardian has discretionary authority to determine
       eligibility for benefits and coverage under those documents.
       ....
       [Guardian] ha[s] the right to cancel [the plan], or any coverage
       hereunder, on the policy anniversary date or premium due date, if, on
       that date, either:
          • less than two employees are insured under [the plan]; or
          • with respect to any contributory coverages, less than 75% of those
             employees who are eligible for insurance under [the plan] are
             insured.

[43-1] at 45; id. at 3; see also [55] at 2 (“The Plan allowed for Defendant to cancel

the Plan if less than two employees were covered.”). Edwards does not argue that

the plan provisions are ambiguous. And he does not dispute that Guardian canceled

the policy on the 2022 policy anniversary date for low group participation. Instead,

Edwards argues that Guardian “waived its right to cancel the [p]lan for falling

under the required participation level” when it “became aware that Pam Edwards




“imposed a law on insurers: regardless of the terms of an insurance policy, an insurer cannot
cancel a policy once an insured has become uninsurable.”). Edwards insists that Kelley’s
holding constitutes a law regulating insurance and is therefore “not preempted.” Id. at 5; see
also id. at 2−4 (arguing Kelley falls within ERISA’s savings clause). Edwards raised this same
argument in response to Guardian’s motion for partial summary judgment. See [18] at 6−9.
The Court considered and rejected this argument in its prior Order. See [34] at 19−23. His
argument fails here for the same reasons expressed in the Court’s prior Order. See id.

                                              6

was the only participating employee” at the end of 2019, yet “continued to accept

premium payments for over two years before choosing to cancel the policy.” [55] at

5. The Court disagrees with Edwards and finds that Guardian did not waive its

right to cancel the plan.

      “Waiver is the voluntary or intentional relinquishment of a known right.”

Bunner v. Dearborn Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 37 F.4th 267, 273 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting

Pitts By & Through Pitts v. Am. Sec. Life Ins. Co., 931 F.2d 351, 357 (5th Cir.

1991)). This circuit has “a clear dividing line as to when waiver claims are

available” in the ERISA context. Price v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., No. 2:04-CV-338, 2008

WL 4187944, at *3 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 8, 2008). “The key element is that waiver must

be intentional.” Id. (citing High v. E-Sys. Inc., 459 F.3d 573, 581 (5th Cir. 2006)).

      To support a showing of waiver, Edwards relies on the Fifth Circuit’s opinion

in Pitts, 931 F.2d 351 (5th Cir. 1991). In Pitts, the group health insurance policy

“specified that the insured group must consist of at least ten employees; otherwise,

[the insurer] could terminate the policy.” Id. at 353. The group eventually dropped

to only one employee. See id. at 357. The insurer knew this, yet it continued to

provide coverage. Id. During that time, the employee became injured and filed a

claim under the policy. Id. at 354. The insurer paid benefits on the claim and

continued to accept premiums for five months before trying to terminate the policy

for low group participation. Id. Indeed, the insurer had paid over $100,000 in

benefits towards the employee’s claim before it tried to halt payments and cancel

the policy. Id. The Fifth Circuit viewed the insurer’s actions as a “classic example of



                                           7
    Case: 1:22-cv-00145-KHJ-MTP Doc #: 58 Filed: 07/12/24 8 of 14 PageID #: 551




waiver,” which prevented the insurer from “assert[ing] a defense to its liability

under the policy.” Id. at 357.

      Pitts does not support a finding of waiver here. There, the insurer’s liability

had attached before the attempted cancellation. See id. at 354. In other words, the

employee had filed a claim under the policy before the insurer tried to cancel the

plan. Id. And the insurer even made benefits payments before trying to cancel the

plan. See id. Those circumstances supported a finding of waiver. See, e.g., 1A Couch

on Ins. § 8:42 (3d ed.) (“Courts have sustained awards to insureds based on . . .

waiver of ineligibility defenses when the . . . insurer had . . . knowledge of the

eligibility problem and accepted premium payments and failed to attempt to cancel

the policy until the insured filed a claim.” (emphasis added)); Otero v. Unum Life

Ins. Co. of Am., 226 F. Supp. 3d 1242, 1272 (N.D. Ala. 2017) (“[C]ourts ha[ve]

applied waiver . . . when ‘the insurance company was attempting to reap an unjust

benefit, e.g., accepting premiums after the insurer’s defense to coverage was known

and clear, thus giving the insurance company the option of keeping the premiums if

beneficial to it or at its option returning the premium and cancel[ing] the policy

when it was convenient to do so, i.e., after a claim is made.’” (emphasis added)).

      That is not what happened here. Guardian canceled the policy months before

Edwards tried to make a claim. See [43-1] at 169 (listing the effective date of

cancellation as January 15, 2022); [55] at 2 (recognizing the attempted claim was

made sometime after Mrs. Edwards’s death on May 27, 2022).




                                            8
    Case: 1:22-cv-00145-KHJ-MTP Doc #: 58 Filed: 07/12/24 9 of 14 PageID #: 552




      When confronted with a similar issue in Bunner, the Fifth Circuit rejected

the plaintiff’s “attempt to expand the scope of [its] waiver analysis to include the

defendants’ [actions] made before [the plaintiff] . . . made a claim for benefits.” 37

F.4th at 273; see also id. at 273−74 (“[T]his is not the equivalent of relinquishing a

known right after [a plaintiff] agreed to a plan and then brought a claim for

benefits.” (emphasis added)). Expanding the court’s waiver analysis would

“impermissibly blur[] the line between estoppel and waiver.” Id. at 274.

      The Court applies the Bunner reasoning and finds that Guardian did not

waive its right to cancel the group plan when it did so per the plan’s terms and

before Edwards brought a claim for benefits.

      B. Notice

      Edwards argues that “Guardian’s cancellation was [a]n improper exercise of

its rights under the plan since it did not properly provide notice.” [55] at 6.

According to him, Mrs. Edwards “was the last remaining member of the policy, and .

. . her condition had worsened to the point that it impaired her ability to function,

[so] it is unlikely that she received those notices.” Id. 5 This argument does not

preclude summary judgment on Edwards’s § 1132(a)(1)(B) claim for at least two

reasons. First, Edwards does not point to a provision in the group plan entitling him

to benefits for improper or untimely notice. Holman v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 533 F.

Supp. 3d 502, 505 (S.D. Tex. 2021) (“A plaintiff suing under [§ 1132(a)(1)(B)] bears




      5The Court notes that Edwards cites no legal authority to support his notice
argument.

                                            9
   Case: 1:22-cv-00145-KHJ-MTP Doc #: 58 Filed: 07/12/24 10 of 14 PageID #: 553




the burden of proving his entitlement to contractual benefits.” (quoting Horton v.

Reliance Std. Life Ins. Co., 141 F.3d 1038, 1040 (11th Cir. 1998))). Second, even if

Edwards had identified a plan provision, there is no genuine fact issue as to

whether Guardian mailed a cancellation notice.

        Indeed, the record overwhelmingly supports a presumption that Guardian

mailed the cancellation notice. “A letter properly addressed, stamped[,] and mailed

may be presumed to have been received by the addressee in the due course of the

mail.” Wells Fargo Bus. Credit v. Ben Kozloff, Inc., 695 F.2d 940, 944 (5th Cir. 1983)

(citation omitted). “A threshold question for [applying this] rule is whether there is

sufficient evidence that the letter was actually mailed.” Custer v. Murphy Oil USA,

Inc., 503 F.3d 415, 419 (5th Cir. 2007). “Placing letters in the mail may be proved by

circumstantial evidence, including customary mailing practices used in the sender’s

business.” Wells Fargo Bus. Credit, 695 F.2d at 944 (citation omitted). While

“[e]vidence of non-receipt can be used to establish that the notice was never mailed,”

a “bare assertion of non-receipt [cannot] create a genuine issue of material fact to

survive summary judgment.” Custer, 503 F.3d at 420−21.

        Guardian offers substantial evidence to support the presumption that it

mailed notice of cancellation to Mrs. Edwards. To begin, Guardian offers the

October 28, 2021, and December 31, 2021, notification letters addressed to Mrs.

Edwards and Allure Salon at the address on record. [43-1] at 168−69; see also [51]

at 9.

      Guardian then offers the Declaration of “Rebecca J[a]nsen, a Team Leader in

Support Assistance[,] which is [the group] responsible for mailing the two notice of

cancellation letters to [Mrs.] Edwards.” Def.’s Reply in Supp. Partial Summ. J. [26]

at 11; see also [50] at 2; Def.’s Reply [57] at 13 (adopting and incorporating

document [26] by reference). Jansen’s Declaration details the standard procedure

followed for creating and mailing the two cancellation notices:

      When a policy is cancel[ed], the underwriting department notifies the
      cancellation department. The cancellation department generates the
      letters and saves them and uploads them into a shared file on a shared
      drive on Guardian’s computer network. My team then uploads them
      through a website portal to a third[-]party vendor who undertakes the
      task of printing the letter and envelope and mailing the letter. Through
      the website portal for our account, we are able to track when the letter
      was mailed. Any items that are returned as non-deliverable[,] we have
      a sharepoint site that tracks the mail and we process and work to find
      new addresses.

[12-3] ¶ 4; see also id. ¶¶ 5−8. Jansen testified that “Guardian’s pre-notification

letter was mailed” on October 28, 2021, to Mrs. Edwards’s address on record, and

“Guardian’s December 31, 2021, notice of cancellation was sent to [Mrs.] Edwards at

the same address on January 5, 2022.” Id. ¶¶ 5−6. Jansen attaches to her

Declaration “a screen[]shot of the vendor’s record of mailing letters for Guardian on

January 5, 2022, which included the December 31 notice of cancellation.” Id. ¶ 6.

The screenshot “shows the order was placed on January 3, the postage was 56 cents,

the letter was inserted into the envelope by hand[,] and the letter was mailed

through the United States Postal Service.” Id. To determine whether either letter

was returned as undeliverable, Jansen “reviewed [the] internal sharepoint site” but




                                          11
   Case: 1:22-cv-00145-KHJ-MTP Doc #: 58 Filed: 07/12/24 12 of 14 PageID #: 555




found that “[n]o letters associated with Group No. 744345, Allure Salon’s group

number, have ever been returned.” Id. ¶ 7.

      Next, Guardian offers the Declaration of Melanie Wiltrout, the Appeals

Leader at Guardian. [50] at 1; see also [12-1] ¶ 3. Among other things, Wiltrout

stated that Guardian sent the October 28, 2021, pre-notification letter and the

December 31, 2021, cancellation letter to Mrs. Edwards at the address of record.

[12-1] ¶ 21. She also testified that “[b]ecause the . . . policy anniversary date was

January 15, [the letters] advised [Mrs. Edwards] that the Group Plan was being

cancel[ed] effective January 15, 2022.” Id. Wiltrout added that Guardian “received

no additional premiums from Allure [Salon]” after the January 15, 2022,

cancellation date. Id. ¶ 22.

      And finally, Guardian offers the internal computer notes logged for the Allure

Salon group policy:




Def.’s Rep. to Request for Prod. [50-1] at 7. Guardian points to the October 28, 2021,

entry showing “PRENOTIFY LETTER SENT” and the December 28, 2021, entry

showing “FINAL LETTER SENT.” See [51] at 12 (citing [50-1] at 7).

       As for Edwards, he offers little evidence to support that Guardian did not

send a notice of cancellation to Mrs. Edwards. He offers only one piece of evidence—

the affidavit of Debbie Jaudon, the insurance agent who sold the group policy to

Mrs. Edwards. [55] at 6 (referencing Jaudon’s testimony from [17-2] that in the

normal insurance practice, the agent would have received a copy of any cancellation

notice). According to Edwards, Jaudon’s non-receipt of the cancellation notices

creates a genuine issue of material fact “as to whether . . . the notices of cancellation

were actually sent.” See id. 6 But Edwards cites no plan provision requiring

Guardian to send these notices to the insurance agent who sold the policy. And he

offers no legal authority to support such a requirement without express plan

language. Aside from Jaudon’s affidavit, Edwards provides no evidence that

Guardian did not mail notice of the plan’s cancellation to Mrs. Edwards.

       Having viewed all the evidence in a light most favorable to Edwards, the

Court finds no genuine issue exists as to whether Guardian mailed a notice of

cancellation to Mrs. Edwards. Guardian’s evidence offers “sufficient proof to create

a presumption that it mailed the [notice].” See Cash v. AXA Equitable Life Ins. Co.,

229 F. Supp. 3d 542, 550 (W.D. Tex. 2017) (evaluating and finding as sufficient

similar evidence consisting of “job and report numbers, testimony from witnesses as

to the mailing process on the specific date at issue, and the electronic copy of the . . .


       6 Edwards also argues that because Mrs. Edwards “was the last remaining member of

the policy, and [] her condition had worsened to the point that it impaired her ability to
function, it is unlikely that she received those notices.” [55] at 6. Edwards offers no record
evidence or legal authority. Id. This “bare assertion of non-receipt [does not] create a genuine
issue of material fact to survive summary judgment.” Custer, 503 F.3d at 421; see also
Faciane v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Can., 931 F.3d 412, 421 (5th Cir. 2019).

[n]otice”). Edwards’s allegation that the insurance agent (Jaudon) did not receive a

cancellation notice does not rebut this point. Indeed, Jaudon’s declaration that she

did not receive the notices does not create a genuine dispute of material fact as to

whether Guardian sent the notices to Mrs. Edwards. See Faciane, 931 F.3d at 420

(“[P]roof that a letter properly directed was placed in a U.S. post office mail

receptacle creates a presumption that it reached its destination in the usual time

and was actually received by the person to whom it was addressed.” (emphasis

added)).

        Because Edwards offers insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, the

Court finds that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Guardian

mailed notice of the group plan’s cancellation to Mrs. Edwards. See Faciane, 931

F.3d at 421 (affirming grant of summary judgment when there was “substantial

evidence buttressing the presumption of receipt and only ineffectual rebuttals”).

V.      Conclusion

        The Court has considered all arguments. Those not addressed would not have

changed the outcome. For the stated reasons, the Court GRANTS Guardian Life

Insurance of America’s [50] Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court will issue a

final judgment consistent with this Order.

        SO ORDERED, this 12th day of July, 2024.
