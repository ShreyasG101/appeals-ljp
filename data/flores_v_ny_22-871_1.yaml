outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== National Football League, Denver Broncos, New York Giants, and Houston Texans''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Defendants argued that the District Court erred by denying their motion to compel arbitration of Flores’s claims against the Denver Broncos and the NFL based on his employment agreement with the New England Patriots, which incorporated by reference the NFL Constitution.

  2. Defendants contended that the District Court erred by denying their motion to compel arbitration of Flores’s claims against the New York Giants, Houston Texans, and the NFL, asserting that Flores’s contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers (which also incorporated the NFL Constitution) required arbitration of those claims.

  3. Defendants argued that the District Court abused its discretion by denying their motion for reconsideration after they submitted a signed copy of the Flores-Steelers agreement, which they claimed should have compelled arbitration of Flores’s claims against the Giants, Texans, and the NFL.

  4. Defendants asserted that the NFL was entitled to enforce the arbitration agreements with respect to Flores’s claims against the NFL, pursuant to the doctrine of equitable estoppel, because the claims against the NFL were factually intertwined with those against the member clubs.

  5. Defendants maintained that the arbitration provisions in the NFL Constitution and the employment agreements were valid and enforceable under applicable state law and the Federal Arbitration Act.'
