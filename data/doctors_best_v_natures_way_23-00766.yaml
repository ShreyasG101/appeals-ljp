reason_for_appeal: '=== Nature’s Way Products, LLC''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court misapplied Abitron Austria GmbH v. Hetronic International, Inc.’s extraterritoriality framework by effectively requiring a showing of domestic likelihood of confusion, and contended that any domestic use in commerce creates a sufficient nexus with the United States such that the likelihood-of-confusion inquiry may proceed without regard to territorial limitations.

  2. Appellant contended, in the alternative, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because there existed a genuine issue of material fact as to the likelihood of consumer confusion under the Sleekcraft factors, including factors it claimed favored Nature’s Way such as strength of the mark, relatedness of the goods, similarity of the marks, and degree of consumer care.

  3. Appellant further argued that the district court abused its discretion in denying Nature’s Way’s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) motion to deny or defer summary judgment, asserting that additional discovery was necessary and that the facts it sought to discover were essential to its opposition and existed based on counsel’s information and belief.

  4. Appellant also argued that the district court improperly discounted or treated as ‘less relevant’ several Sleekcraft factors that Nature’s Way claimed weighed in its favor, thereby misapplying the likelihood-of-confusion analysis.

  5. On appeal, appellant additionally maintained that there was evidence of domestic consumer confusion or a likelihood thereof, and that the district court erred by focusing only on domestic confusion and disregarding potential confusion arising from foreign marketing and sales.'
