outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. and fourteen of its members''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that New York General Business Law § 898 is preempted by the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), both expressly and by implied conflict, because it allows civil liability actions that PLCAA was intended to prohibit and does not fall within PLCAA’s predicate exception.

  2. Appellants contended that even if Section 898 falls within PLCAA’s predicate exception, it is still preempted because it lacks the predicate exception’s explicit ''knowing violation'' and ''proximate cause'' requirements, potentially authorizing lawsuits that PLCAA bars.

  3. Appellants argued that Section 898 violates the dormant Commerce Clause because it facially discriminates against interstate commerce by applying only to products that have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, thereby privileging intrastate commerce.

  4. Appellants contended that Section 898 imposes an undue burden on interstate commerce under the Pike balancing test, as its burdens on interstate commerce are clearly excessive in relation to any putative local benefits.

  5. Appellants argued that Section 898 violates the dormant Commerce Clause’s extraterritoriality principle by allowing New York to impose liability on out-of-state actors for conduct occurring entirely outside New York.

  6. Appellants contended that Section 898 is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it fails to provide sufficient notice of what conduct is prohibited or required, particularly due to its ''reasonableness'' standard and broad language regarding contributing to a public nuisance.'
