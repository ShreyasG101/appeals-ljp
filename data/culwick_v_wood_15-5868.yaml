outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Andrae E. Wood''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Wood argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Estate on the breach of contract claim, contending that the language in the Property Settlement Agreement (PSA) was ambiguous and did not preclude her from claiming the Decedent’s pension and annuity benefits.

  2. Wood contended that the district court erred in determining that the Decedent’s father was an intended third-party beneficiary of the PSA and that the Estate, as assignee of his claims, was entitled to contractual damages resulting from the breach.

  3. Wood asserted that the district court should have dismissed the Estate’s breach of contract claim because the Estate failed to establish that it had suffered actual or nominal damages.

  4. Wood argued that she was not given notice of the third-party beneficiary theory and was denied an opportunity to present evidence to rebut this theory, raising procedural objections to the district court’s determination.

  5. Wood argued that pre-judgment interest should be tolled under New Jersey law, specifically citing the reopening of discovery at the Estate’s request as warranting a limited tolling of prejudgment interest.

  6. Wood contended that the award of attorney’s fees was unreasonable, arguing that the district court should have reduced the hourly rate of the Estate’s counsel, reduced the number of billed hours in 2015 and 2016 due to limited relationship to the Estate’s success, and reduced the number of billed hours in 2019 and 2020 due to overbilling.

  7. Wood also argued that the Estate was not entitled to attorney’s fees because the damages in the case were nominal.'
