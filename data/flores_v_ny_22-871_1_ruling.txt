VALERIE CAPRONI, United States District Judge:                            
    Plaintiffs, who are current and former coaches for teams in the National Football League 
(the “NFL”), have sued the NFL and various member teams for racial discrimination and 
retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and several state laws.  See Am. Compl., Dkt. 22.  On 
March 1, 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ motion to compel 
arbitration.  See Op. & Order, Dkt. 76 (the “Arbitration Opinion”).  The Court compelled 
arbitration of the claims brought by Ray Horton against the Tennessee Titans, Steve Wilks 
against the Arizona Cardinals, and Brian Flores against the Miami Dolphins, as well as all 
related claims against the NFL.1  Id.  The Court denied the parties’ motions for reconsideration 
1    The Court denied the motion to compel arbitration of Mr. Flores’s claims against the New York Giants, the 
Denver Broncos, and the Houston Texans, as well as his related claims against the NFL.  See Arbitration Opinion, 
Dkt. 76.                                                                  
on July 25, 2023.  See Op. & Order, Dkt. 102 (the “Reconsideration Opinion”).  Defendants 
appealed to the Second Circuit those portions of the Arbitration Opinion and the Reconsideration 
Opinion (together, the “Opinions”) that denied their motion to compel arbitration.  See Not. of 
Appeal, Dkt. 113.  Plaintiffs both cross-appealed those portions of the Opinions that compelled 
arbitration, see Not. of Cross-Appeal, Dkt. 122, and filed the instant motion, pursuant to 28 

U.S.C. § 1292(b), to certify for appeal certain legal issues that led the Court to compel 
arbitration, see Not. of Mot., Dkt. 119.  For the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion is DENIED. 
                          DISCUSSION2                                    
    I.   Legal Standard                                                  
    Under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), a district court may certify for appellate review any 
interlocutory order that (1) “involves a controlling question of law,” (2) “as to which there is 
substantial ground for difference of opinion,” and (3) where “an immediate appeal from the order 
may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.”  That statute creates a narrow 
exception to the “basic tenet of federal law” that appellate review should follow final judgment. 

Koehler v. Bank of Bermuda Ltd., 101 F.3d 863, 865 (2d Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).  The 
Second Circuit has held that interlocutory appeals “must be strictly limited to the precise 
conditions stated in the law.”  Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro, 921 F.2d 21, 25 (2d Cir. 
1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                    
    As to the first criterion, a controlling question of law “must [be] a ‘pure’ question of law 
that the reviewing court could decide quickly and cleanly without having to study the record.”  In 
re Adelphia Commc’ns Corp., 333 B.R. 649, 658 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (quoting In re Worldcom, Inc., 
No. M–47 HB, 2003 WL 21498904, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 30, 2003)).  The question must also 

2    The Court assumes familiarity with the factual background set forth in the Arbitration Opinion.  See 
Arbitration Opinion at 2–5.                                               
be “controlling,” meaning that reversal of the order would “‘result in dismissal of the action’”; 
reversal of the order could “‘significantly affect the conduct of the action’”; or the issue on 
appeal “‘has precedential value for a large number of cases.’”  In re Facebook, Inc., IPO Secs. & 
Derivative Litig., 986 F. Supp. 2d 524, 535–36 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting Glatt v. Fox 
Searchlight Pictures Inc., No. 11-CV-6784 (WHP), 2013 WL 5405696, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 

2013)).                                                                   
    As to the second criterion, a “substantial ground for difference of opinion” exists where 
“‘there is conflicting authority on the issue’” or where “‘the issue is particularly difficult and of 
first impression in the Second Circuit.’”  Hometrust Mortg. Co. v. Lehman Bros. Holdings, Inc., 
No. 15-CV-4060 (WHP), 2015 WL 5674899, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2015) (quoting Capitol 
Records, LLC v. Vimeo, LLC, 972 F. Supp. 2d 537, 551 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)).    
    As to the third criterion, an appeal “advance[s] the ultimate termination of the litigation” 
if the appeal promises to “‘advance the time for trial or shorten the time required for trial.’” 
Primavera Familienstifung v. Askin, 139 F. Supp. 2d 567, 570 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (quoting In re 

Oxford Health Plans, Inc., 182 F.R.D. 51, 53 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)).            
    Even when all three criteria are met, a district court retains “unfettered discretion” to 
deny leave to appeal for “any reason,” including judicial economy.  In re Facebook, 986 F. Supp. 
2d at 530 (quoting Klinghoffer, 921 F.2d at 24).  As a general rule, interlocutory appeals are 
“strongly disfavored” in the federal system.  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  
They should be “strictly reserved for exceptional cases,” and they are “especially rare in early 
stages of litigation.”  Id. at 533; see also In re Flor, 79 F.3d 281, 284 (2d Cir. 1996) (discussing 
the “exceptional” circumstances justifying interlocutory appeal).         
    II.  Plaintiffs Fail to Establish Exceptional Circumstances Warranting
         Certification for Appellate Review                              
    Plaintiffs request that the Court certify for appeal (1) whether an arbitration agreement 
that is not the result of collective bargaining is unconscionable and therefore unenforceable if it 
designates a biased party representative as arbitrator to resolve statutory discrimination claims 
(the “Unconscionability Issue”); and (2) whether the effective vindication doctrine renders an 
arbitration agreement unenforceable if it designates a biased party representative as arbitrator to 
resolve statutory discrimination claims (the “Effective Vindication Issue”) (together, the “Issues 
for Appeal”).  See Pls. Mem., Dkt. 120, at 3.  These issues do not qualify for interlocutory appeal 
because they do not present controlling questions of law, do not raise a substantial ground for 
difference of opinion, and would not materially advance this litigation if resolved by the Second 

Circuit, which Plaintiffs assert has pendant appellate jurisdiction over their cross-appeal.3     
         A. Pure and Controlling Questions of Law                        
    Plaintiffs assert that the Issues for Appeal involve pure questions of law that can be 
decided without studying “any substantial record” because this Court decided them without the 
benefit of discovery.  See Pls. Mem. at 5.  Plaintiffs are misguided.     


3    Although the filing of a notice of appeal ordinarily “divests a district court of jurisdiction over the issues 
presented in the appeal,” Ret. Bd. of the Policemen’s Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chi. v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 775 
F.3d 154, 159 n.4 (2d Cir. 2014) (citing Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)), a district
court may still take action “in aid of the appeal,” New York v. DHS, 974 F.3d 210, 215 (2d Cir. 2020) (quoting Int’l
Ass’n of Machinists & Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v. E. Air Lines, Inc., 847 F. 2d 1014, 1017 (2d Cir. 1988)); see
also Hoffenberg v. United States, No. 00-CV-1686 (RWS), 2004 WL 2338144, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2004)
(deciding a plaintiff’s motion for interlocutory appeal on the merits even though the plaintiff had already filed a
notice of appeal “in aid of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and in the interest of judicial
economy”).  Moreover, even if the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant Plaintiffs’ motion, it may still deny it pursuant to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 (“Rule 62.1”).  Because the Court denies Plaintiffs’ motion for the reasons
discussed infra, it need not decide whether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.  See Paguirigan v. Prompt Nursing
Empl. Agency LLC, No. 17-CV-1302 (NG) (JO), 2020 WL 239456, at *1 n.1 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2020) (denying a
motion for interlocutory appeal certification of certain legal issues where the movant had already filed a notice of
appeal of the Court’s decision including those issues and noting that the Court “need not assess, issue by issue, [its]
jurisdiction over [the present] motion” because Rule 62.1 provided “express authority to deny it”) (citing Fed. R.
Civ. P. 62.1)).                                                           
    As a preliminary matter, Plaintiffs ignore that although discovery was unnecessary for the 
Court to issue the Opinions, the Court considered allegations in the Amended Complaint, the 
NFL rules and policies, and Plaintiffs’ employment contracts — a substantial factual record — 
when resolving the parties’ motions.  Cf. Dill v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 19-CV-10947 
(KPF), 2021 WL 3406192, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2021) (denying plaintiffs’ motion for 

interlocutory appeal of a decision compelling arbitration in part because requiring the Second 
Circuit to address “the interpretation and enforceability” of an arbitration provision would 
“‘mandate an examination of the entire arbitration agreement’” (quoting In re Anderson, 550 
B.R. 228, 237 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)).                                           
    Plaintiffs’ argument also misinterprets the standard for certification.  A “pure” question 
of law is “not synonymous with ‘an issue that might be free from a factual contest.’”  In re 
Belton, No. 15-CV-1934 (VB), 2016 WL 164620, at *1 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 12, 2016) (citation 
omitted) (denying plaintiffs’ motion for interlocutory appeal of a decision compelling arbitration 
in part because the Court’s determination “require[d] a particularized inquiry into the nature of 

the claim” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  Rather, a question of law is only 
suitable for certification if it raises “an abstract legal issue.”  In re Worldcom, Inc., 2003 WL 
21498904, at *10 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Simply “refram[ing] the 
factual issues in [the] case as questions of law” by “turning them into hypotheticals” is 
insufficient.  Bishop v. Best Buy, Co. Inc., No. 08-CV-8427 (LBS), 2011 WL 4011449, at *13 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8, 2011); see also Goldfarb v. Channel One Russia, No. 18-CV-8128 (JPC), 
2021 WL 1392850, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2021) (“[D]isputes concerning the application of 
the law to the specific facts of a case typically are not appropriate for an interlocutory appeal.” 
(citations omitted)).4                                                    
    The Unconscionability Issue does not raise a pure question of law because its resolution 
would require the Second Circuit to assess whether Plaintiffs’ arbitration agreements are 
unconscionable based on the unique facts of this case, including the NFL Commissioner’s role, 

the NFL Commissioner’s statements, the language in Plaintiffs’ contracts, and the purported 
absence of collective bargaining.  Far from raising a pure question of law, the Unconscionability 
Issue would require the Second Circuit to pore over the factual circumstances surrounding 
distinct arbitration agreements.  Such mixed factual and legal analysis is not suitable for 
interlocutory appeal.  See, e.g., Cuadras v. MetroPCS Wireless, Inc., No. 09-CV-7897 (CAS), 
2011 WL 11084069, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 11, 2011) (denying plaintiffs’ motion for interlocutory 
appeal of a decision compelling arbitration despite plaintiffs’ argument that the agreement was 
unconscionable because plaintiffs did not advance a pure question of law); Adler v. Dell, Inc., 
No. 08-CV-13170 (GCS), 2009 WL 646885, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 10, 2009) (same because 

“fact[-]specific inquiries” regarding the relevant agreement’s unconscionability were not pure 
questions of law).                                                        
    The Effective Vindication Issue5 is unsuitable for appeal on similar grounds.  Plaintiffs’ 
framing of the issue assumes that the NFL Commissioner is “biased.”  Reaching that conclusion, 

4    Courts, therefore, routinely conclude that pre-discovery opinions raise mixed questions of law and fact 
rather than pure questions of law suitable for appeal.  See, e.g., SEC v. Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Secs. LLC, No. 23-
CV-992 (AT), 2023 WL 5671544, at *2–3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2023) (denying defendants’ motion for interlocutory
appeal of a decision denying a pre-discovery motion to dismiss because the court’s “routine application of law to the
factual allegations in the complaint d[id] not present an issue of pure law” (citations omitted)); Altimeo Asset Mgmt.
v.Qihoo 360 Tech. Co. Ltd., No. 19-CV-10067 (PAE), 2023 WL 4249356, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. June 29, 2023) (same
because the case presented “an application of law to the unique set of facts pled in [the complaint]”).
5    Plaintiffs argue that the NFL Commissioner’s alleged bias will prevent them from vindicating their claims 
in arbitration.  The effective vindication doctrine is “a judge-made exception to the [Federal Arbitration Act]” that 
“finds its origins in the desire to prevent prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue statutory remedies.”  Am. 
however, and determining the extent of any bias, would require a fact-specific analysis of the 
NFL Commissioner’s role, the NFL Commissioner’s conduct, and the parties’ agreements.  
Plaintiffs cannot obtain certification by embedding fact-specific assumptions in purported 
questions of pure law.  See Bishop, 2011 WL 4011449, at *13 (concluding that the plaintiff did 
not identify questions of pure law for certification because his proposed questions “depend[ed] 

on” factual conclusions that had not been reached by the district court). 
    For all of those reasons, the Issues for Appeal do not raise pure questions of law for 
interlocutory review.6                                                    






Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228, 235–236 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  
The Supreme Court has recognized two types of arbitration agreements to which this doctrine may apply: an 
agreement “forbidding the assertion of certain statutory rights” and an agreement imposing arbitration fees “so high 
as to make access to the forum impracticable.”  Id. at 236 (citation omitted). 

6    Because the Issues for Appeal are not pure questions of law, the Court need not decide whether any pure 
questions of law would be sufficiently “controlling” to warrant appeal.  Plaintiffs acknowledge, however, that the 
“mere potential reversal of an order compelling arbitration” does not typically satisfy the “controlling” question of 
law requirement.  Pls. Mem., Dkt. 120, at 6.                              

    Plaintiffs also assert that the Court should grant their motion because Defendants are already appealing 
those portions of the Opinions denying arbitration.  Plaintiffs argue that, under those circumstances, it would be 
unfair to prevent Plaintiffs from appealing those portions of the Opinions compelling arbitration.  See Pls. Mem. at 
7–8.  The Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) expressly allows for this asymmetry, however, by only authorizing 
interlocutory appeals of orders denying arbitration.  See 9 U.S.C. § 16.  The FAA thereby “endeavor[s] to promote 
appeals from orders barring arbitration and limit appeals from orders directing arbitration.”  Augustea Impb Et 
Salvataggi v. Mitsubishi Corp., 126 F.3d 95, 98 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see 
also Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski, 599 U.S. 736, 740 (2023) (“Notably, Congress provided for immediate interlocutory 
appeals of orders denying—but not of orders granting—motions to compel arbitration.”).  In any event, Plaintiffs 
still have the opportunity to argue in favor of pendant appellate jurisdiction before the Second Circuit.  See The 
Boeing Co. v. Egyptair, No. 05-5986 (CV), 2007 WL 1315716, at *2–3 (2d Cir. May 7, 2007) (noting that the 
Second Circuit may exercise pendant appellate jurisdiction “(a) where an issue is inextricably intertwined with a 
question that is the proper subject of an immediate appeal, or (b) where review of a jurisdictionally insufficient issue 
is necessary to ensure meaningful review of a jurisdictionally sufficient one” (quoting U.S. Fidelity & Gar. Co. v. 
Braspetro Oil Servs., Co., 199 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir. 1999)) (summary order).   
         B. Substantial Ground for Difference of Opinion                 
    Plaintiffs assert that there is substantial ground for difference of opinion regarding the 
Issues for Appeal because “no definitive case law” by the Supreme Court or the Second Circuit 
applies, amici objected to the Court’s reasoning, and courts in other jurisdictions adopted 
Plaintiffs’ reasoning.  See Pls. Mem. at 12–16.  The Court disagrees.     

    It is well established that “[s]imply because” a question of law has “not yet been directly 
addressed by the Supreme Court or the Second Circuit” does not mean that it raises a reasonable 
ground for difference of opinion.  Williston v. Eggleston, 410 F. Supp. 2d 274, 277 (S.D.N.Y. 
2006) (collecting cases and concluding that interlocutory appeal was inappropriate).  In this case, 
however, the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit have issued key decisions on the Issues for 
Appeal; those decision simply do not align with Plaintiffs’ position.     
    Regarding the Unconscionability Issue, the Second Circuit already rejected the argument 
that, as a matter of law, the NFL Commissioner cannot fairly arbitrate claims regarding the 
NFL’s conduct.  See Arbitration Opinion at 22–23 (discussing Nat’l Football League Mgmt. 

Council v. Nat’l Football League Players Ass’n, 820 F.3d 527, 548 (2d Cir. 2016)); 
Reconsideration Opinion at 13–14 (same).  Plaintiffs have not cited any applicable state law that 
would require a contrary result.  See Arbitration Opinion at 16–17, 25–26 (analyzing Arizona, 
Florida, and Tennessee contract law); Reconsideration Opinion at 15–16. 7   
    As for the Effective Vindication Issue, the Supreme Court has not recognized alleged 
structural bias in arbitration agreements as grounds for applying the effective vindication 

7    Plaintiffs accuse the Court of “relying on out-of-jurisdiction case law” to support its reasoning, and of 
selectively disregarding out-of-jurisdiction caselaw that favors Plaintiffs.  Pls. Mem. at 27.  The federal caselaw that 
the Court cited in support of its decision applied the state laws at issue in this case.  See Arbitration Opinion at 24–
25 (discussing Eleventh and Sixth Circuit cases applying Florida and Tennessee law).  The out-of-jurisdiction 
decisions that the Court summarily disregarded, see id. at 25 n.25, are state law decisions that have no bearing on 
this federal action involving Florida, Tennessee, and Arizona contract law.   
doctrine.  To the contrary, Justice Kagan warned that the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence would 
enable companies to appoint “obviously biased” arbitrators.  See Arbitration Opinion at 24 
(discussing Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228 (2013)); Reconsideration 
Opinion at 15 (same).8  Moreover, contrary to Plaintiffs’ position, federal law does provide 
protection against biased arbitrators.  It does so, however, by allowing arbitration awards to be 

overturned upon a showing of “evident partiality or corruption,” not by preventing arbitration 
from the get-go.  See Arbitration Opinion at 23 (discussing Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane 
Corp., 500 U.S. 20 (1991) and 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(2)); Reconsideration Opinion at 13–14 (same). 
    For all of those reasons, Plaintiffs have not established substantial ground for difference 
of opinion regarding the Issues for Appeal.                               
         C. Advancing the Ultimate Resolution of the Litigation          
    Plaintiffs maintain that certifying the Issues for Appeal may materially advance the 
ultimate termination of this case because, if the Court grants certification and the Second Circuit 
rules in Plaintiffs’ favor, the parties will avoid wasting time in arbitration.  See Pls. Mem. at 23–

24. For the reasons discussed supra, however, it is more likely that the Second Circuit would
affirm the Court’s decision or decline to hear the appeal, resulting in “unnecessar[y]” delay.  
Murray v. UBS Secs., LLC, No. 13-CV-5914 (KPF), 2014 WL 1316472, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 

8    As Plaintiffs acknowledge, see Pls. Mem. at 22–23, the Court already distinguished federal caselaw from 
other jurisdictions.  See Arbitration Opinion at 24 n.22.  The Court also found amici’s objections unpersuasive.  See 
Reconsideration Opinion at 14 n.14.                                       
    The law journal excerpt Plaintiffs cite in their favor, see Michael Conklin et al., Brian Flores’s Employment 
Discrimination Lawsuit Against the NFL: A Game Changer or Business As Usual? [hereinafter “Conklin Article”], 
29 Jeffrey S. Moorad Sports L. J. 299, 306 (2022) (“Unfortunately for the NFL, case law is clear regarding the 
essential nature of arbitrator neutrality.”), is purportedly justified by a Supreme Court case that even Plaintiffs do not 
reference because it is so far afield.  See Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 393 U.S. 145, 
146–48 (1968) (wherein the parties’ arbitration agreement required them to select a “neutral” third member of an 
arbitration panel and one of the parties failed to disclose its “close financial relations” with the purportedly neutral 
arbitrator; the Supreme Court therefore set aside the arbitration award).  Plaintiffs’ decision to cite a law journal 
article that “call[s] into question” their litigation strategy is also curious.  Conklin Article at 324.     
2014); see also Dill, 2021 WL 3406192, at *9 (denying plaintiffs’ motion for interlocutory 
appeal of a decision compelling arbitration in part because certification “would be inconsistent 
with the national policy favoring arbitration, and the Second Circuit’s distaste for delaying the 
arbitral process through appellate review” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); /n re 
Belton, 2016 WL 164620, at *2 (“Proceeding to arbitration, rather than certifying an 
interlocutory appeal, is the fastest way for these cases to be decided on the merits.”).?  Certifying 
the Issues for Appeal is, therefore, unlikely to materially advance the ultimate resolution of the 
litigation. 
                                CONCLUSION 
      For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion to certify the Issues for Appeal to the 
Second Circuit is DENIED.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the open motion 
at Docket Entry 119.

VALERIE CAPRONI, United States District Judge:                            
    Plaintiffs, who are current and former coaches for NFL teams, have sued the NFL and 
various member teams for racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 
and several state laws.1  See Am. Compl., Dkt. 22.  The Court granted in part and denied in part 
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration in an opinion dated March 1, 2023.  Op. (“Arbitration 
Opinion”), Dkt. 76.  The Court compelled arbitration of the claims brought by Ray Horton 
against the Tennessee Titans, Steve Wilks against the Arizona Cardinals, and Brian Flores 
against the Miami Dolphins, as well as all related claims against the NFL; the Court denied the 
1    These include the New York State Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Law, the New 
Jersey Law Against Discrimination, and the Florida Private Whistleblower Statute.  Am. Compl., Dkt. 22. 
motion to compel arbitration of Mr. Flores’s claims against the New York Giants, the Denver 
Broncos, and the Houston Texans, as well as his related claims against the NFL.  Id.   
    Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the portions of the Arbitration Opinion granting 
the motion to compel arbitration, and Defendants cross-moved for reconsideration, seeking to 
compel arbitration of the remaining claims.2  Pls. Mot., Dkt. 79; Defs. Mot., Dkt. 81.  Each party 

opposed their adversary’s motion.  See Defs. Opp., Dkt. 89; Pls. Opp., Dkt. 93.  For the reasons 
discussed below, the motions for reconsideration are DENIED.              
                          DISCUSSION                                     
    I.   Legal Standard                                                  
    The standard under which courts evaluate a motion for reconsideration “is strict, and 
reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling 
decisions or data that the court overlooked . . . .”  Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 
(2d Cir. 1995).  A motion for reconsideration may be granted if the movant demonstrates “an 
intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a 

clear error or prevent manifest injustice.”  Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 956 
F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992) (quotation omitted); see also Sigmon v. Goldman Sachs Mortg. 
Co., 229 F. Supp. 3d 254, 257 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (“[A] party moving for reconsideration must set 
forth ‘the matters or controlling decisions which counsel believes the Court has overlooked.’” 
(quoting Local Civil Rule 6.3)).  Whether to grant a motion for reconsideration is a decision 
within “the sound discretion of the district court . . . .”  Aczel v. Labonia, 584 F.3d 52, 61 (2d Cir. 
2009).                                                                    


2    Defendants previously argued that Mr. Flores’s arbitration agreement with the Miami Dolphins applied 
retroactively to his claims against the Denver Broncos.  See Op., Dkt. 76 at 10.  The Court held that the arbitration 
agreement could not be applied retroactively under Florida law, see id., and Defendants do not seek reconsideration 
of that portion of the Arbitration Opinion.                               
     A motion for reconsideration is not a party’s “opportunity to put forward evidence that 
he could have, but failed, to provide the Court when the Court initially considered the motion.”  
United States v. Posada, 206 F. Supp. 3d 866, 868 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (internal quotation omitted) 
(collecting cases).  Additionally, “a motion to reconsider should not be granted where the 

moving party seeks solely to relitigate an issue already decided.”  Schrader, 70 F.3d at 257.  
“[N]ewly discovered evidence” can be a basis for reconsideration, but only if the evidence was 
not available prior to entry of the order at issue.  Marhone v. Cassel, No. 16-CV-4733, 2021 WL 
142278, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2021).  “These criteria are strictly construed against the moving 
party so as to avoid repetitive arguments on issues that have been considered fully by the 
court.”  Griffin Indus., Inc. v. Petrojam, Ltd., 72 F. Supp. 2d 365, 368 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (citation 
omitted).                                                                 
    II.  Defendants’ Motion for Reconsideration Is Denied                
    Defendants sought to compel arbitration of Mr. Flores’s claims against the Denver 
Broncos, New York Giants, and Houston Texans arguing, inter alia, that the arbitration 
provisions in his recent contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers (“Flores-Steelers Agreement”), and 

the NFL Constitution incorporated therein, applied retroactively to claims against any NFL team.  
See Op. at 9.  Defendants alternatively sought to compel arbitration of Mr. Flores’s claims 
against the Denver Broncos because those claims arose when Mr. Flores was coaching for the 
New England Patriots.  See id.  His contract with the Patriots (“Flores-Patriots Agreement”) had 
an arbitration agreement that applied to claims against any NFL team.  See id.  
    The Court held that Mr. Flores did not have a valid arbitration agreement with the 
Steelers because Defendants had not proven that the arbitration agreement was part of a valid 
contract.  See id. at 13.  Section 12 of the Flores-Steelers Agreement states that the contract 
would “become valid and binding upon each party only when and if it shall be approved by the 
Commissioner of the NFL;” in the version of the contract filed by Defendants in support of their 
motion to compel arbitration, the Commissioner’s signature line was blank.  See Second DiBella 
Decl. Ex. 4 (“Flores-Steelers Agreement”), Dkt. 73.  Accordingly, the Flores-Steelers Agreement 
submitted by Defendants, by its own terms, was not “valid and binding.”  Id.; see also Op. at 13.  

The Court also held that the arbitration agreement contained in the NFL Constitution and 
incorporated into the Flores-Patriots Agreement was unenforceable because the NFL retained the 
unilateral right to modify the NFL Constitution and the arbitration agreement, rendering the 
arbitration agreement illusory according to Massachusetts state law.  Op. at 21–22. 
         A.  The Flores-Steelers Agreement Is Not Binding                
    In their motion for reconsideration, Defendants ask the Court to reconsider its prior 
decision with respect to the Flores-Steelers Agreement based on a newly-filed version of the 
Flores-Steelers Agreement that contains the NFL Commissioner’s signature.  Defs. Mem., Dkt. 
82 at 13.  The signed contract, which is new evidence, cannot be considered on a motion for 
reconsideration because it was available to Defendants before the Court issued the Arbitration 

Opinion.  See Marhone, 2021 WL 142278, at *2.  Defendants acknowledge that they possessed a 
fully-signed version of the Flores-Steelers Agreement when the motion to compel arbitration was 
being briefed.  See Defs. Mem. at 13 n.7; see also Smith Decl., Dkt. 98 ¶ 2 (stating that 
Commissioner Goodell approved the Flores-Steelers Agreement on June 17, 2022).  The Court 
credits Defendants’ statement of regret for “not having supplemented the record with a 
Commissioner-signed version of the agreement” during the eight months that the motion to 
compel arbitration was pending.  Defs. Mem. at 13 n.7.  But a motion for reconsideration is not a 
means to mend holes in the record with neglected evidence.  See Horsehead Res. Dev. Co., Inc. 
v. B.U.S. Envt’l Serv. Inc., 928 F. Supp. 287, 289 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (“[A] motion for 
reconsideration may not be used to plug gaps in an original argument or to argue in the 
alternative once a decision has been made.”  Id. (cleaned up).)           
    Defendants alternatively argue that the Flores-Steelers Agreement was valid and binding 
even without Commissioner Goodell’s signature.  Defs. Mem. at 14.  The contract plainly states, 

however, that it is “valid and binding upon each party only when and if it shall be approved by 
the Commissioner of the NFL.”  Flores-Steelers Agreement § 12.  “Courts do not assume a 
contract’s language was chosen carelessly,” and must give effect to the “clear and unequivocal” 
language of a contract.  Crawford Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Commonwealth, 888 A.2d 616, 623 (Pa. 
2005).  The Flores-Steelers Agreement clearly establishes that it would not be binding on the 
parties until it was signed by Commissioner Goodell.                      
    In sum, as the parties moving to compel arbitration, Defendants carried the burden of 
proving the existence of a written agreement binding the parties to arbitrate the present matter.  
See Op. at 14 (citing Hines v. Overstock.com, Inc., 380 F. App’x 22, 24 (2d Cir. 2010) 
(collecting cases); Dreyfuss v. Etelecare Glob. Sols.-U.S. Inc., 349 F. App’x 551, 552–53 (2d 

Cir. 2009)).  When Defendants moved to compel arbitration, they failed to do so. 
    Defendants argue that because Mr. Flores actually served as the Steelers’ coach, there is 
an enforceable contract between the Steelers and Mr. Flores.  See Defs. Mem. at 14.  They posit 
that the Commissioner’s signature was “[a]t most . . . a condition precedent to the parties’ 
obligations to perform under the agreement, which was waived and excused when Mr. Flores 
performed, and accepted performance from the Steelers, under that very same agreement.”3  Id.  
Defendants failed to raise this argument as part of the underlying motion to compel arbitration, 


3    Pennsylvania law, which governs the Flores-Steelers Agreement, see Flores-Steelers Agreement § 20, 
provides that “if a condition precedent is not satisfied, the obligations of the non-performing party are discharged.”  
McDermott v. Party City Corp., 11 F. Supp. 2d 612, 620 (E.D. Pa. 1998).   
and the Court will not consider it now.  Defendants’ suggestion that the Court should now revise 
its prior decision based on this new legal theory because neither party previously briefed the 
issue flips the standard for motions for reconsideration on its head.  It is black letter law that, 
“[e]xcept where a movant is relying on new facts that could not have been previously discovered 

or newly promulgated law, additional facts or new legal theories cannot be asserted by way of a 
motion for reconsideration.”  Bloomfield Inv. Res. Corp. v. Daniloff, No. 17-CV-4181, 2021 WL 
2310446, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 7, 2021) (internal quotation omitted).4     
         B.  Flores-Patriots Contract                                    
    Defendants further dispute the Court’s conclusion that the Flores-Patriots Agreement is 
illusory under Massachusetts law because Defendants retained the right unilaterally to modify 
the terms of the NFL Constitution, which contained the arbitration agreement applicable to Mr. 
Flores’s disputes with other teams, without notice.  See Defs. Mem. at 1; Op. at 21.  Defendants 
alternatively argue that even if the agreement is unenforceable, the unilateral modification 
provision should be severed from the arbitration agreement.  See Defs. Mem. at 1–2.  For the 

reasons discussed in the Arbitration Opinion and further detailed below, Massachusetts law 
precludes enforcement of the arbitration agreement incorporated into the Flores-Patriots 
Agreement because the contract is illusory; because an illusory contract is no contract at all, 
severance is not possible.                                                



4    Even if the Court were to consider Defendants’ new argument, Defendants’ motion would likely still fail.  
While some courts applying Pennsylvania law have excused compliance with conditions precedent when the parties 
accepted partial performance of the contract, see McDermott, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 622, Defendants did not previously, 
nor have they now, introduced evidence that might allow the Court to conclude, as a matter of law, that there was 
partial performance.  See MBR Constr. Servs., Inc. v. IBEW Local, No. 14-CV-1694, 2016 WL 815566, at *7 (M.D. 
Pa. Mar. 2, 2016) (noting that Pennsylvania law requires the party seeking to compel performance of a contract to 
prove that any conditions precedent are satisfied).                       
              1.  Unilateral Modification Provision                      
    In holding the Flores-Patriots Agreement illusory, the Court relied on Jackson v. Action 
for Boston Community Development, Inc., 525 N.E.2d 411 (Mass. 1988), which held that a 
former employee could not contractually enforce the terms of her employment manual.  The 

Jackson court considered several factors in finding that the employee manual did not constitute 
an enforceable contract, including the fact that the manual could be unilaterally modified by the 
employer.  See id. at 414–15.  Although the manual provided that employees would be notified 
of any changes, the Jackson court found it significant that the employer did not call “special 
attention” to the manual, such as reviewing the manual during orientation, and the plaintiff did 
not sign the manual or otherwise manifest assent to the terms of the manual.  See id. at 416 
(internal citations omitted).  Jackson observed that the fact “that the defendant retained the right 
to modify unilaterally the personnel manual’s term . . . tends to show that any ‘offer’ made by 
the defendant in distributing the manual was illusory.”  Id. at 415.  The court also noted that it 
was significant that the record did not “reveal[] any negotiation over the terms of the personnel 

manual.”  Id.                                                             
    O’Brien v. New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 664 N.E.2d 843, 847 (Mass. 1996), 
clarified the fact-intensive inquiry that courts must undertake in evaluating whether a document 
subject to unilateral modification is an enforceable contract while emphasizing that the 
“[p]rinciples stated in the Jackson opinion remain sound.”  Id. at 847.  The O’Brien court 
refrained from “defin[ing] the extent to which management may effectively reserve its right to 
change or withdraw a manual” because the employer in that case had not expressly reserved the 
right to make unilateral changes, although it did distribute new policy manuals annually.  See id. 
at 849; see also id. at 848 n.3.  The court held that “the context of the manual’s preparation and 
distribution is, to us, the most persuasive proof that it would be almost inevitable for an 
employee to regard it as a binding commitment . . . .”  Id. at 849 (internal quotation omitted). 
    Buttrick v. Intercity Alarms, LLC, 929 N.E.2d 357 (Mass. App. Ct. July 1, 2010),5 applied 
Jackson and its progeny to find that the employee manual in that case was a binding contract.  In 

Buttrick, the employer had required the employee to sign the manual, had distributed numerous 
copies of the manual, and had personally reviewed the manual’s terms with the employees.  See 
id. at *1–2.  Given the “special attention” paid to the manual, Buttrick held that there was an 
enforceable contract, notwithstanding the employer’s reservation of rights to make unilateral 
modifications.  Id. at *1.  The court reiterated, however, that “[w]hether an implied contract 
based upon the terms of the manual [existed] . . . was a fact-bound inquiry,” while observing that 
“a number of factors weighed against the finding of a binding contract.”  Id.   
    Numerous courts have applied Jackson and its progeny to decline to enforce contracts 
that permit one party unilaterally to modify the terms without notifying the counterparty of any 
changes.6  See, e.g., Douglas v. Johnson Real Est. Invs., LLC, 470 F. App’x 823, 826 (11th Cir. 

2012); Fawcett v. Citizens Bank, N.A., 297 F. Supp. 3d 213, 221 (D. Mass. 2018) (collecting 
cases); McNamara v. S.I. Logistics, Inc., No. 17-CV-12523, 2018 WL 6573125, at *3–4 (D. 
Mass. 2018) (collecting cases); Wainblat v. Comcast Cable Comm’ns, LLC, No. 19-10976, 2019 
WL 5698446, at *4 (D. Mass. 2019); Murray v. Grocery Delivery E-Servs. USA Inc., 460 F. 
Supp. 3d 93, 97–98 (D. Mass. 2020); see also Kauders v. Uber Techs., Inc., 159 N.E.3d 1033, 

5    Buttrick v. Intercity Alarms, LLC, 929 N.E.2d 357 (Mass. App. Ct. 2010), is a nonprecedential opinion that 
was issued with a caveat that it “may not fully address the facts of the case or the panel’s decisional rationale,” id. at 
*1.                                                                       

6    Ferguson v. Host International, Inc., 757 N.E.2d 267 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001), is not to the contrary.  
Although the employer retained the right to amend the manual without notice, the employer had in fact distributed 
the amended manual to employees, id. at 269.  The Ferguson court noted that the employer’s distribution of the 
manual conveyed to employees its importance as a binding document.  Id. at 272.   
1041 n.10 (Mass. 2021) (criticizing a terms of usage agreement permitting unilateral 
modification without notice and noting that courts have held that such contracts are 
unenforceable).7                                                          
    Defendants have not demonstrated that they paid the type of “special attention” to the 

NFL Constitution that is necessary to make its terms part of an implied contract under 
Massachusetts state law.  Although Mr. Flores signed a contract that incorporated by reference 
the NFL Constitution,8 that does not automatically mean that the NFL Constitution is 
enforceable.  The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has held that an employee’s 
signature on the manual itself would suggest, at most, that finding an implied contract exists 
“may be justified.”  Weber v. Comm. Teamwork, Inc., 752 N.E.2d 700, 714 (Mass. 2001).   
    In the context of employee manuals, Massachusetts courts have made clear that “the 
context of the preparation and distribution of the employment policies is the most persuasive 
proof” in determining whether employment policies are implied contracts.  LeMaitre v. Mass. 


7    While Defendants assert that these cases improperly single out arbitration agreements for application of the 
unilateral modification rule, see Defs. Mem., Dkt. 82 at 11–12, Massachusetts courts find that contracts containing a 
unilateral modification provision are illusory in a wide variety of contexts, including employee manuals, which, like 
the NFL Constitution, set forth general policies governing the conduct of both employer and employee.  See infra 
pp. 7–8; see also Durbeck v. Suffolk Univ., 547 F. Supp. 3d 133, 147–48 (D. Mass. 2021) (applying Jackson to 
academic catalogs).                                                       

    Defendants also attempt to analogize the instant case to Gilbert v. Dell Technologies, Inc., 415 F. Supp. 3d 
389 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), which applied Jackson to enforce an arbitration agreement provided to an employee in 
conjunction with her employment agreement.  Defs. Mem. at 7–8.  In that case, the employer retained authority 
unilaterally to modify the arbitration policies but not the arbitration agreement itself.  See id. at 393–94, 398.  Those 
policies were, as here, incorporated into the employment agreement.  See id. at 393.  The employer in Gilbert, 
however, had drawn special attention to the arbitration policies by placing the contractual clause that incorporated 
the arbitration policies “prominently above the signature line.”  Id. at 396; see also id. at 393. 

8    One provision of the Flores-Patriots Agreement stated that Mr. Flores received a copy of the 124 NFL 
Constitution and understood his obligations therein.  Flores-Patriots Agreement § 15; see also Second DiBella Decl. 
Ex. 1 (“NFL Constitution”), Dkt. 73.  Mr. Flores disputes that he received a copy of the NFL Constitution at the 
time of signing.  He has submitted no evidence to support that assertion, Pls. Opp. to Arb. Mem., Dkt. 62 at 9, and 
Defendants submitted no evidence to show that he was given a copy of the constitution at that time.  Because the 
Court finds that whether Mr. Flores received a copy of the NFL Constitution is not dispositive in light of the totality 
of circumstances, the Court need not resolve this dispute.                
Turnpike Auth., 897 N.E.2d 1218, 1220 (Mass. 2008) (employment manual that was regularly 
distributed created contractual rights and obligations); see also LeMaitre v. Mass. Turnpike 
Auth., 876 N.E.2d 888, 893 (Mass. Ct. App. 2007) (noting that the manual was “regularly 
distributed”).  Mr. Flores argues, and Defendants do not dispute, that neither the NFL nor the 

Patriots reviewed with him the obligations of the NFL Constitution, required him to sign the 
NFL Constitution itself, or distributed to him subsequently-amended versions of the NFL 
Constitution.  See Pls. Opp. to Arb. Mem., Dkt. 62 at 9; Pls. Opp. at 8; Defs. Reply, Dkt. 99 at 4.  
See, e.g., Buttrick, 2010 WL 2609364, at *1–2.  Nor could Mr. Flores have reasonably negotiated 
the terms of the NFL Constitution, which, by its terms, may only be amended by a vote of all 
NFL member clubs.  See Jackson, 525 N.E.2d at 414–15 (considering lack of negotiation the 
terms of an employment manual as one factor in determining that a unilateral modification 
provision rendered the agreement illusory).                               
    Finally, Defendants belatedly argue that the Court need not address the fact that the NFL 
has the unilateral power to modify the NFL Constitution because it may simply enforce the 

version of the NFL Constitution that was in force when the Flores-Patriots Agreement was 
signed.9  See Defs. Mem. at 4 n.1; Defs. Reply at 3 n.1.  Defendants forfeited this argument by 
failing to raise it in their briefs filed in conjunction with their motion to compel arbitration and 
by failing to submit the version of the NFL Constitution that was in effect when the Flores-
Patriots Agreement was signed with their motion to compel arbitration.  They offer no 
explanation for their oversight, and the Court will not consider this argument now.10  See 

9    Defendants point to a court filing in a class-action litigation in an out-of-district case regarding NFL 
players’ concussion injuries that attached as an exhibit a prior version of the NFL Constitution as proof that the NFL 
did not amend the arbitration provision after the Flores-Patriots Agreement was executed.  Defs. Mem. at 4 n.1.   

10   Even if the Court were to consider this argument, however, serious questions would remain regarding the 
enforceability of the arbitration agreement in light of the NFL’s ability unilaterally to modify the NFL Dispute 
Resolution Procedural Guidelines, which govern any arbitral proceeding between a coach and the NFL.  See Flores-
AlexSam, Inc. v. Aetna, Inc., No. 13-CV-1025, 2021 WL 3268853, at *9 n.8 (D. Conn. July 30, 
2021) (noting that judicial notice of additional facts was inappropriate on a motion for 
reconsideration where the petitioner “has not explained any reason for failing to include [the 
additional facts] in its earlier filings”).                               

              2.  Severability                                           
    Defendants finally argue that, even if the unilateral modification provision renders the 
arbitration agreement unenforceable, the Court should sever the unilateral modification provision 
and enforce the remainder of the parties’ contract.  See Defs. Mem. at 9–10.  The Federal 
Arbitration Act (“FAA”) requires courts to treat arbitration clauses “as severable from the 
contract in which it appears . . . unless the validity challenge is to the arbitration itself . . . .”  
Granite Rock Co. v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 561 U.S. 287, 298–99 (2010).  The fact that 
agreements to arbitrate are “severable does not mean that they are unassailable;” if the party 
seeking to avoid arbitration challenges the arbitration provision specifically, as Plaintiffs have, 
courts may appropriately consider whether the arbitration agreement is so defective that 

severance cannot save it.  Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 71 (2010); see also 
Pls. Opp. to Arb. Mot. at 9.                                              
    The focus of Jackson and its progeny is whether, in the broader context of the contractual 
relationship, one party’s ability unilaterally to change the terms of a contract renders that 
contract illusory.11  See Jackson, 525 N.E.2d at 415; see also O’Brien, 664 N.E.2d at 848; 

Patriots Agreement § 17; Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 2 at 13–17 (“NFL Dispute Resolution Procedural Guidelines”), 
Dkt. 73.                                                                  

11   Emmanuel v. Handy Technologies, Inc., 992 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2021), is not to the contrary; it did not address 
the plaintiff’s argument that the unilateral modification provision rendered the contract illusory because, inter alia, 
plaintiff did not direct that argument to the arbitration agreement specifically, see id. at 10–11.   

    Similarly, Joule, Inc. v. Simmons, No. SUCV200904929A, 2011 WL 7090714 (Mass. Super. Ct. Dec. 5, 
2011), did not opine on the issue of whether the employer’s ability unilaterally to modify the arbitration procedures, 
Gilbert v. Dell Techs., Inc., 415 F. Supp. 3d 389, 398 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“Under Massachusetts 
law, an agreement to arbitrate can be illusory if the agreement can be modified unilaterally by 
one party.”).  Massachusetts courts view unilateral modification provisions as posing a challenge 
to contract formation because the fact that the offeror retains the right unilaterally and 

retroactively to alter the terms of the offer “tends to show that any ‘offer’ made . . . was 
illusory,” such that there was no offer at all.  Jackson, 525 N.E.2d at 415; see also O’Brien, 664 
N.E.2d at 848.  Thus, severance cannot be an appropriate remedy because there is no otherwise 
valid agreement from which the Court might sever invalid terms.           
    Defendants’ “argument that any illusory provision of the contract could simply be 
severed and the remainder of the contract stand would require [the Court] to engage in an absurd 
process,” essentially “reviving a contract [it] found was never formed for its lack of 
consideration, omitting the change-in-term provision clause that was fatal to the contract’s 
proper formation, to therefore conclude a contract was formed.”  Nat’l Fed. of the Blind v. The 
Container Store, 904 F.3d 70, 87 (1st Cir. 2018); see also McNamara, 2018 WL 6573125, at *3 
(collecting cases).12                                                     


but not the arbitration agreement, rendered the contract illusory because, after remand from the Supreme Judicial 
Court, the only issue remaining for consideration was whether the contract was unconscionable.  See id. at *2.  In 
Joule, the employer had drawn special attention to the document containing arbitration procedures by appending it 
to the agreement “at the time that [the employee] signed it.”  Id. at *4.  The Flores-Patriots Agreement states only 
that Mr. Flores had reviewed the document at an unspecified time, and the version of the Flores-Patriots Agreement 
in the record did not append the NFL’s Constitution or Dispute Resolution Procedural Guidelines, which were both 
subject to the NFL’s unilateral modification.  See supra, page 10, note 10. 

12   Even if the Court were to find that there was a valid agreement from which it could sever the unilateral 
modification provision in order to create a valid arbitration agreement, severance would still be inappropriate.  The 
existence of a severance clause in a contract containing unenforceable terms “is not dispositive of the question 
whether those terms may in fact be severed” under Massachusetts law.  Machado v. System4 LLC, 989 N.E.2d 464, 
472 n.15 (Mass. 2013).  Rather, courts must examine whether severance would alter the basic agreement to arbitrate, 
or the defect is so pervasive that severance would be inappropriate.  See Am. Fam. Life Assurance Co. of N.Y. v. 
Baker, 848 F. App’x 11, 13 (2d Cir. 2021); Feeney v. Dell Inc., 908 N.E.2d 753, 769 (Mass. 2009). 

    Defendants argue that severance would be “especially straightforward” and merely require revising section 
15 of the Flores-Patriots Agreement to delete the requirement that Mr. Flores adhere to the NFL Constitution “as 
amended from time to time hereafter.”  Defs. Reply, Dkt. 99 at 5 (internal quotation omitted).  This assertion ignores 
    III.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for Reconsideration Is Denied               
    Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration extensively relitigates their arguments that the 
arbitration agreements are unconscionable and prevent effective vindication of Plaintiffs’ 
statutory claims, which the Court previously considered at length and rejected.  Without 

rehashing the entirety of the Arbitration Opinion, the Court briefly explains why the arbitration 
agreements contained in Mr. Flores’s contract with the Miami Dolphins (“Flores-Dolphins 
Agreement”), Mr. Wilks’ contract with the Arizona Cardinals (“Wilks-Cardinals Agreement”), 
and Mr. Horton’s contract with the Tennessee Titans (“Horton-Titans Agreement”) are 
enforceable.                                                              
    As in their opposition to the motion to compel arbitration, Plaintiffs primarily base their 
arguments on their speculation that the NFL Commissioner will necessarily be biased as an 
arbitrator.  See, e.g., Pls. Mem., Dkt. 80 at 3–5.  The Second Circuit has already rejected the 
argument that the NFL Commissioner cannot fairly “adjudicate the propriety of his own 
conduct,” even when he acts as the sole arbitrator.13  Nat’l Football League Mgmt. Council v. 

Nat’l Football League Players Ass’n, 820 F.3d 527, 548 (2d Cir. 2016); see also Op. at 22–23.   
    While Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish that case on the grounds that it involved a contract 
that was the process of collective, rather than individual, bargaining and concerned a dispute 


the fact that sections 16 and 17 of the Flores-Patriots Agreement also require Mr. Flores to adhere to subsequent 
amendments of NFL rules, including the NFL’s Dispute Resolution Procedural Guidelines, which govern 
arbitration.  Furthermore, the NFL Constitution generally grants the NFL Commissioner the unilateral power to set 
and amend all NFL rules and regulations, including the NFL Dispute Resolution Procedural Guidelines, and to 
promulgate other arbitration-related rules in the future that would bind Mr. Flores.  See NFL Constitution § 8.5.   In 
sum, multiple portions of the parties’ agreement grant the NFL unilateral authority to modify the contract; those 
provisions infect “fundamental elements of the arbitration regime” that cannot be severed from the whole.  Feeney, 
908 N.E.2d at 769.                                                        

13   That case concerned “quarterback Tom Brady’s involvement in a scheme to deflate footballs used during 
the 2015 American Football Conference Championship Game to a pressure below the permissible range.”  Nat’l 
Football League Mgmt. Council v. Nat’l Football League Players Ass’n, 820 F.3d 527, 531 (2d Cir. 2016). 
over player discipline instead of federal statutory rights, the Second Circuit relied on neither fact 
in reaching its decision.  See Pls. Mem. at 5–6; Nat’l Football League Mgmt. Council, 820 F.3d 
527 at 548.  Furthermore, it is well-established that “[m]ere inequality in bargaining power . . . is 
not a sufficient reason” to invalidate arbitration agreements; “the FAA’s purpose was to place 
arbitration agreements on the same footing as other contracts.”14  Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson 

Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 24, 33 (1991).  As the Second Circuit emphasized in National Football 
League Management Council, “arbitration is a matter of contract, and consequently, the parties 
to an arbitration can ask for no more impartiality than inheres in the method they have chosen.”15  
820 F.3d at 548; see also Garcia v. Church of Scientology Flag Serv. Org,, Inc., No. 18-13452, 
2021 WL 5074465, at *12 (11th Cir. 2021) (holding that because the plaintiff “agreed to a 
method of arbitration with inherent partiality” it was bound to the results of the arbitration).  
    The FAA contemplates that federal courts should address issues of bias in the 
administration of arbitration by examining whether the arbitrator demonstrated “evident 
partiality” in presiding over the arbitration; if he did, the arbitration award may be overturned.  

Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 30; see also 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(2).  Plaintiffs argue that Gilmer limits this rule 
to cases in which neutral procedures govern arbitration.  See Pls. Mem. at 7–8.  While Gilmer 
noted that the existence of unbiased procedures favored enforcing the arbitration agreement at 
issue, that was not central to its holding.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 30.  Rather, Gilmer held that 
the FAA already contemplates protection against bias by permitting courts to overturn arbitration 


14   Amici law professors take issue with the trajectory of the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence regarding the 
Federal Arbitration Act generally and suggest that Gilmer was wrongly decided.  Amici Mem., Dkt. 88 at 6–7, 6 
n.11.  Whatever the merits of the learned professors’ argument, this Court is, of course, bound by Gilmer and its 
progeny.                                                                  

15   There are numerous reasons why Plaintiffs rationally could have consented to select the NFL 
Commissioner as arbitrator, including the fact that the Commissioner possesses unique subject-matter expertise on 
matters related to the NFL.                                               
awards that are marred by evident partiality of the arbitrator.  The Court noted only in passing 
that “[i]n any event,” the arbitration rules applicable to that dispute protected “against biased 
panels.”  Id.  In short, “it is well established that a district court cannot entertain an attack upon 
the . . . partiality of arbitrators until after the conclusion of the arbitration and the rendition of the 

award.”  Aviall, Inc. v. Ryder Sys., Inc., 110 F.3d 892, 895 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal quotation 
omitted).                                                                 
    Plaintiffs alternatively ask the Court to find that the arbitration agreement is 
unenforceable because the alleged structural bias prevents Plaintiffs from effectively vindicating 
their statutory claims.  Pls. Mem. at 14–15.  As the Court previously explained in its Arbitration 
Opinion, the effective vindication doctrine is a highly circumscribed judge-made exception to the 
FAA.  See Am. Express v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228, 235–36 (2013); Op. at 24.  The 
Supreme Court has never expanded it to encompass structural bias, and the nonbinding caselaw 
cited by Plaintiffs is unpersuasive for the reasons already discussed in the Arbitration Opinion.  
See Op. at 24.  While Plaintiffs accuse the Court of breaking new ground in compelling 

arbitration of their claims and causing manifest injustice, this result was anticipated by Justice 
Kagan, who expressed concern that the Supreme Court’s limitations on the effective vindication 
doctrine would permit companies to “appoint as an arbitrator an obviously biased person — say, 
the CEO . . . .”  Am. Express, 570 U.S. at 242 (Kagan, J. dissenting); Op. at 24 n.23.16 
    Finally, Plaintiffs once again argue that the arbitration agreements are unconscionable 
under the applicable state contract laws.  Pls. Mem. at 11–13.  Plaintiffs did not initially, nor do 


16   Nothing in this Opinion should be read to suggest that the Undersigned harbors no concern about whether 
the process the NFL has apparently chosen to implement in this sort of dispute with coaches will be, and will be 
publicly perceived to be, fair.  The Court is ruling only that, given the current legal structure, it must await the 
outcome of the arbitration to decide whether Plaintiffs’ fears of unfairness were warranted or whether the NFL 
Commissioner gave them a fair shake to prove their claims.                
they now, cite any binding caselaw holding that arbitration agreements in which one party 
consents to the appointment of the counterparty’s representative as arbitrator are unconscionable.  
While some courts have declined to enforce arbitration agreements in which the arbitrator 
selection procedures were so one-sided as to render the agreement unconscionable under 

applicable state law, those cases are inapplicable when the party seeking to avoid arbitration has 
consented to resolving his dispute before a specific arbitrator.  See Op. at 24–25; see also 
Gainseville Health Care Ctr., Inc. v. Weston, 857 So.2d 278, 286 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003) 
(noting that Florida state courts “decline to indulge the presumption that the . . . arbitral body 
conducting a proceeding will be unable or unwilling to retain competent, conscientious and 
impartial arbitrators” in determining whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable 
(quoting Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 30)).                                        
    Plaintiffs, in essence, ask the Court to fashion a specific rule out of whole cloth to protect 
them from potential arbitrator bias that may never manifest itself.  To do so would be in direct 
violation of the FAA’s admonition against carving out rules disfavoring the enforcement of 

arbitration agreements from generally applicable contract law.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 24.   
                          CONCLUSION                                     
    For the foregoing reasons, both Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ motions for reconsideration 
are DENIED.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the open motions at 
docket entries 79 and 81.

VALERIE CAPRONI, United States District Judge:                            
    This case shines an unflattering spotlight on the employment practices of National 
Football League (“NFL”) teams.  Although the clear majority of professional football players are 
Black, only a tiny percentage of coaches are Black.  In 2002, to much hoopla, the NFL 
announced that it was going to do something about the paucity of Black coaches.1  Its solution 
was to adopt the so-called “Rooney Rule.”  The Rooney Rule as originally adopted required any 
NFL team looking to hire a head coach to interview at least one minority candidate.  The

shake.html?searchResultPosition=7.                                        
Amended Complaint in this case alleges that, however laudable the intent, the Rooney Rule has 
devolved into a cruel sham, with Black candidates being interviewed for positions that the team 
has already decided will be filled by a white candidate and with Black coaches being treated 
more harshly vis-à-vis employment decisions than similarly-situated white coaches.  See Am. 

Compl., Dkt. 22.                                                          
    Three Black men who are current or former NFL coaches have sued the NFL and several 
member teams for racial discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the New York State 
Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Law, and the New Jersey Law Against 
Discrimination.  See Am. Compl.  Defendants moved to compel arbitration and to stay the 
current proceedings, Mot. to Compel Arbitration, Dkt. 47, and Plaintiffs opposed the motion, Pls. 
Opp., Dkt. 62.  For the reasons discussed below, the motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED 
except as to the Brian Flores’s claims against the New York Giants, the Houston Texans, the 
Denver Broncos, and his related claims against the NFL, as to which the motion is DENIED.  
                         BACKGROUND2                                     

    The NFL is an unincorporated association of thirty-two professional football clubs.  Defs. 
Mem., Dkt. 48 at 4.  Although each club is a separate legal entity, the clubs are governed by a 
shared set of NFL rules and policies, including the NFL Constitution.  See generally Second 
DiBella Decl. Ex. 1 (“NFL Const. & Bylaws”), Dkt. 73.  The NFL is overseen by a 
Commissioner, currently Roger Goodell, who is appointed by member teams.  See NFL Const. & 
Bylaws Art. VIII; Pls. Opp. at 3.                                         

2    Although not raised by the parties, recent case law seems to suggest that there is some disagreement among 
courts in this circuit concerning the appropriate standard to apply on a pre-discovery motion to compel arbitration.  
Compare Bensadoun v. Jobe-Riat, 316 F.3d 171, 175 (2d Cir. 2003) (applying a summary judgment standard) with 
Aleksanian v. Uber Techs. Inc., 524 F. Supp. 3d 251, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (applying a motion to dismiss standard).  
Because the parties do not dispute the material facts relevant to the motion to compel arbitration, the Court need not 
resolve this apparent conflict for the purposes of this motion.           
         A. Plaintiffs’ Allegations of Discrimination in the NFL         
    Brian Flores, Steve Wilks, and Ray Horton are Black men who allege that they have each 
been discriminated against when employed or when seeking to be employed as coaches for NFL 
teams.  Am. Compl. ¶ 1.  Messrs. Flores and Horton allege that several NFL teams interviewed 

them for head coaching positions solely to fulfill the so-called “Rooney Rule” without any intent 
of hiring them.3  See id. at ¶¶ 185, 200–05, 271–73.                      
              1. Brian Flores                                            
    Mr. Flores alleges that he was a victim of racial discrimination on four distinct occasions. 
    Mr. Flores first alleges that the Denver Broncos interviewed him in 2019 solely to satisfy 
the Rooney Rule without actually considering him for its head coach position.  Id. ¶¶ 200–05.   
    Mr. Flores next alleges that when he was head coach of the Miami Dolphins, Dolphins 
owner Stephen Ross attempted to bribe him (i) to lose games so the Dolphins would get the first 
pick in the next year’s draft and (ii) to recruit “a prominent quarterback in violation of League 
tampering rules.”  Id. ¶ 168; see also id. ¶¶ 161–63.  When Mr. Flores refused both requests, he 

was stigmatized as an “angry black man” and ultimately fired.  Id. ¶¶ 175, 177.  Mr. Flores 
further alleges that the Dolphins provided him with an improper separation agreement, failed to 
pay him contractually-required severance pay in violation of his employment contract, and 
instituted arbitration proceedings against him to claw back his wages as retaliation for filing this 
lawsuit.  Id. ¶¶ 220–26.                                                  



3    Of course, non-compliance with the Rooney Rule is not, itself, actionable.  Nevertheless, Plaintiffs’ 
allegations that teams conducted sham interviews, if proven, could undercut any defense predicated on the teams 
showing that Black candidates were “considered” for all open positions.   
    Mr. Flores further alleges that, in January 2022, the New York Giants invited him to 
interview for the position of head coach, but the Giants had already selected Brian Daboll.4  Id. 
¶¶ 182–88.                                                                
    Finally, Mr. Flores claims that the Houston Texans removed him from consideration for 

their head coach position solely as retaliation for filing the instant lawsuit.  Id. ¶¶ 207–13.   
              2. Steve Wilks                                             
    Steve Wilks alleges that the Arizona Cardinals hired him as a “bridge coach,” meaning a 
coach “who is not given a meaningful opportunity to succeed and is simply ‘keeping the seat 
warm’ until . . . a new coach is brought in.”  Id. ¶ 233; see also id. ¶ 232.  Mr. Wilks alleges that, 
despite a strong coaching performance “under extremely difficult circumstances” — including 
the arrest of Cardinals’ General Manager Steve Keim, a weak roster featuring a rookie 
quarterback who had been drafted over Mr. Wilks’s objection, and pressure to lose games to 
improve the Cardinals’ position in the NFL draft — he was wrongfully terminated.  Id. ¶ 247; 
see also id. ¶¶ 19, 240, 250.  Mr. Wilks alleges that the Cardinals fired him as the “fall guy” for 

failures that were attributable in significant part to Mr. Keim, before hiring Kliff Kingsbury, a 
white man, as head coach.  See id. ¶¶ 258–60.                             
              3. Ray Horton                                              
    In January 2016, while he was the Tennessee Titans’ defensive coordinator, Mr. Horton 
interviewed to be the Titans’ head coach.  Id. ¶¶ 266, 271–73.  Mr. Horton alleges that the Titans 
only offered him the interview to comply with the Rooney Rule, as the Titans had already 
decided to hire Mike Mularkey, a white man, when they interviewed Mr. Horton.  Id. ¶¶ 273–78.  


4    Before Mr. Flores interviewed for the position he received a text from Bill Belichik, the New England 
Patriots’ head coach, congratulating him for getting the job.  Am. Compl., Dkt. 22 ¶¶ 186–87.  Mr. Belichik appears 
to have confused Brian Daboll, who was hired as the Giants’ head coach, with Brian Flores, who was not.  Id. 
In a 2020 interview, Mr. Mularkey stated that Amy Adams Strunk, the Titans’ controlling owner, 
told him that he was going to be the head coach before they “went through the Rooney rule.”  Id. 
¶ 280; see also id. ¶ 272.  Mr. Horton further alleges that his unsuccessful interview with the 
Titans branded him as a “stale” candidate and interfered with him receiving additional interviews 

for head coach positions.  Id. ¶ 284.                                     
         B. Plaintiffs’ Employment Contracts                             
    Messrs. Flores, Wilks, and Horton each had an employment contract with each team he 
coached.  See Pls. Opp. at 3; Defs. Mem. at 6.  The NFL was not a party to those contracts.  The 
NFL Commissioner was, however, required to approve each contract.  See Defs. Mem. at 3, 21; 
see also, e.g., Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 4 (“Flores-Steelers Agreement”), Dkt. 73 § 12.  In each 
contract, each Plaintiff acknowledged that he had read the NFL Constitution and Bylaws and 
agreed to be bound by them.  See Pls. Opp. at 9; see also, e.g., Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 2 
(“Flores-Dolphins Agreement”), Dkt. 73 § 7.1; Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 7 (“Horton-Titans 
Agreement”), Dkt. 73 § 6(a)–(c); Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 5 (“Wilks-Cardinals Agreement”), 

Dkt. 73 § 9(a).                                                           
    While the exact text of those contracts varies, in relevant part each agreement provides 
that the NFL Commissioner will oversee an alternative dispute resolution process for all disputes 
arising between the parties.  See, e.g., Flores-Dolphins Agreement § 12.2; Horton-Titans 
Agreement § 6(a); Wilks-Cardinals Agreement § 10(a).  Mr. Wilks’s contract with the Cardinals 
also included a clause delegating any disputes regarding whether the contracts were “void or 
voidable” to the arbitrator.  See Wilks-Cardinals Agreement § 10(e).      
                       LEGAL STANDARD                                    
    Pursuant to Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), “agreements to arbitrate 
[are] ‘valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for 
the revocation of any contract.’”5  AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 336 (2011) 

(quoting 9 U.S.C. § 2).  “[B]efore an agreement to arbitrate can be enforced, the district court 
must first determine whether such agreement exists between the parties.  This question is 
determined by state contract law.”  Meyer v. Uber Techs., Inc., 868 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2017) 
(citing Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 229 (2d Cir. 2016)) (internal citation 
omitted).                                                                 
    If an arbitration agreement exists, the Court must also determine “whether the dispute 
falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement.”  Meyer, 868 F.3d at 74 (internal quotation 
omitted).  Because of the “emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution,” 
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 631 (1985), “any 
doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,” 

Moses H. Cone Mem’l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24–25 (1983).  See also 
Specht v. Netscape Commc’ns Corp., 306 F.3d 17, 35 (2d Cir. 2002) (Sotomayor, J.) 
(“[A]rbitration is indicated unless it can be said with positive assurance that an arbitration clause 
is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.”  Id. (internal quotation 
omitted).).  In light of the “liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements . . . arbitration 
agreements should be enforced according to their terms unless the FAA’s mandate has been 



5    Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to the parties’ agreement to 
arbitrate.  Pls. Opp., Dkt. 62 at 5 (citing the FAA).                     
overridden by a contrary congressional command.”  Sutherland v. Ernst & Young LLP, 726 F.3d 
290, 295 (2d Cir. 2013) (cleaned up).6                                    
    An agreement to arbitrate arbitrability is “an additional, antecedent agreement” that is 
also covered by the FAA.  Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer and White Sales, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 524, 

529 (2019) (quoting Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 70 (2010)).  Unlike other 
agreements to arbitrate, for which there is a presumption in favor of finding the parties agreed to 
arbitration, “the law reverses the presumption” for agreements to arbitrate arbitrability.  First 
Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 945 (1955).  Accordingly, “the issue of 
arbitrability may only be referred to the arbitrator if there is clear and unmistakable evidence 
from the arbitration agreement, as construed by the relevant state law, that the parties intended 
that the question of arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator.”  Contec Corp. v. Remote Sol., 
Co., Ltd., 398 F.3d 205, 208 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting Bell v. Cendant Corp., 293 F.3d 563, 566 
(2d Cir. 2002)).                                                          
                          DISCUSSION                                     

    Plaintiffs acknowledge that they entered into employment agreements with several of the 
Defendant teams and that those agreements provide an alternative dispute resolution process.  
Plaintiffs argue, however, that the alternative dispute resolution agreements are invalid or do not 
encompass their claims, or, if they are valid and do encompass their claims, they are 
unenforceable.  See, e.g., Pls. Opp. at 4 n.2, 8–9, 15–16, 24.  For the reasons discussed below, 
the Court finds that Mr. Flores’s claims against the Dolphins, Mr. Wilks’s claims against the 



6    Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 does not indicate a Congressional intent to override the 
FAA’s policy toward the enforcement of arbitration agreements.  See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 
63, 65, 67–68 (2010) (applying the FAA to plaintiff’s section 1981 claim). 
Cardinals, and Mr. Horton’s claims against the Titans must be submitted to arbitration; Mr. 
Flores may, however, litigate his claims against the Broncos, Giants, and Texans in federal court. 
    I.   Plaintiffs’ Claims, Except Those Against the Giants and Texans, Are
         Covered by the Parties’ Arbitration Agreements                  
    Each employment agreement selected the law of the state in which the team was based as 
the governing law.7  See Defs. Mem. at 3 n.2.  Pursuant to the applicable state laws, the Court 
finds that Plaintiffs’ claims, except for Mr. Flores’s claims against the Giants and Texans, fall 
within the scope of the parties’ arbitration agreements.8                 
         A. Brian Flores                                                 
    Mr. Flores has sued four different football teams: the Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, 

New York Giants, and Houston Texans.  From 2008 until February 3, 2019, Mr. Flores was a 
coach for the New England Patriots.  Am. Compl. ¶ 157; Defs. Mem. at 5.  While under contract 
to the Patriots, he interviewed for the Broncos’ head coach position, but he was not hired.  Am. 
Compl. ¶¶ 200–04.  From 2019 until January 10, 2022, Mr. Flores was the Dolphins’ head coach.  
Id. ¶¶ 158, 177.  After being fired by the Dolphins, Mr. Flores interviewed for the Giants’ and 
Texans’ head coach position but was not hired by either team.  Id. ¶¶ 179, 184, 191, 207, 216.  
This lawsuit was filed on February 1, 2022, Compl., Dkt. 1, and on February 18, 2022, the 



7    The Court applies the law of the state selected by the applicable choice of law provisions in each contract. 
The choice of law clauses are enforceable because each employment contract selects the law of the state in which 
the Defendant team is based and in which each coach was employed; consequently, “the chosen law bears a 
reasonable relationship to the parties or the transaction.”  Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Great Am. Ins. Co. of New 
York, 822 F.3d 620, 641 (2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Welsbach Elec. Corp v. MasTec N. Am., Inc., 859 N.E.2d 498, 500 
(2006)).                                                                  
8    Mr. Flores’s claims against the Broncos fall within the scope of the applicable arbitration agreement, but 
the agreement is not enforceable for reasons discussed infra, section III(A). 
Pittsburgh Steelers hired Mr. Flores as “the senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach,” 
Defs. Mem. at 18; see also Flores-Steelers Agreement at 1.9               
    Defendants argue that, even though Mr. Flores never contracted with the Giants, Broncos, 
or Texans, his claims against those teams are nevertheless subject to arbitration pursuant to the 

NFL Constitution as incorporated into his contracts with the Patriots, Dolphins, and Steelers.  
See Defs. Mem. 18, 20 n.3.  For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that only Mr. 
Flores’s contract with the Dolphins and Patriots contain valid arbitration agreements relevant to 
his claims, and there is no binding arbitration agreement in Mr. Flores’s contract with the 
Steelers.                                                                 
              1. Mr. Flores’s Claims Against the Broncos                 
    Mr. Flores alleges that the Denver Broncos discriminated against him because of his race 
when they failed to hire him.  Mr. Flores argues that he is not required to arbitrate his claims 
against the Broncos because he never specifically agreed to arbitrate claims against the Broncos.  
See Pls. Opp. at 24.  At the time Mr. Flores interviewed with the Broncos, he was under contract 

with the New England Patriots; in his contract with the Patriots, he expressly agreed to abide by 
the NFL Constitution, which was “made a part of th[e] Agreement.”  Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 3 
(“Flores-Patriots Agreement”), Dkt. 73 § 15; see also NSTAR Elec. Co. v. Dep’t of Pub. Utilities, 
968 N.E.2d 895, 905–06 (Mass. 2012) (holding that a contract incorporates a document by 
reference where it “clearly communicate[s] that the purpose of the reference is to incorporate the 
referenced material into the contract,” id. at 905 (internal quotation omitted)). 



9    Mr. Flores now appears to be the Minnesota Vikings’ defensive coordinator.  See Craig Peters, Vikings 
Hire Brian Flores as Defensive Coordinator, Vikings.com (Feb. 6, 2023, 5:25 P.M.), 
https://www.vikings.com/news/brian-flores-defensive-coordinator-hired-2023. 
    Section 8.3 of the NFL Constitution contains an arbitration provision that is broader than 
the one contained in the employment contracts; it grants the NFL Commissioner “full, complete 
and final jurisdiction and authority to arbitrate” several types of disputes.  As is relevant here, the 
NFL Commissioner has jurisdiction to arbitrate “[a]ny dispute between any . . . coach . . . and 

any member club or clubs.”  NFL Const. & Bylaws § 8.3(B).                 
    Mr. Flores’s claims against the Broncos plainly constitute a “dispute between any . . . 
coach . . . and any member club.”  Id.  Mr. Flores’s contract with the Patriots bound him to 
follow the NFL Constitution while he was employed by the Patriots, including its provision 
giving the Commissioner sole authority to arbitrate any dispute with an NFL team.  See Flores-
Patriots Agreement § 15; Pls. Opp. at 24 (acknowledging that Mr. Flores was under contract with 
the Patriots when he interviewed with the Broncos).                       
    Defendants also argue that the arbitration agreement in the NFL Constitution, as 
incorporated into Mr. Flores’s 2019 contract with the Miami Dolphins, retroactively applies to 
Mr. Flores’s claims against the Broncos, which arose before he became the Dolphins’ head 

coach.  See Defs. Mem. at 18.  Courts, however, have “refused to compel arbitration of claims 
arising from disputes which arose outside of the effective dates of arbitration agreements,” unless 
the agreement expressly includes claims preceding the contract.  Klay v. All Defendants, 389 
F.3d 1191, 1203 (11th Cir. 2004); see also Jones v. Waffle House, Inc., 866 F.3d 1257, 1271 n.1
(11th Cir. 2017) (arbitration agreement that explicitly encompassed past claims could be 
interpreted to include disputes over plaintiff’s “previous attempts at employment.”); Baptist 
Hosp. of Miami, Inc. v. Media Healthcare Plans, Inc., 376 F. Supp. 3d 1298, 1308–10 (S.D. Fla. 
2019) (applying Florida law and collecting cases).10                      

10   Even if the NFL Constitution, as incorporated into Flores-Dolphins contract, could be interpreted to 
retroactively apply to claims against teams that arose before the contract’s effective date, the arbitration agreement 
    Defendants finally argue that Mr. Flores must arbitrate his claims against the Broncos 
because the NFL’s alleged systemic racism was already in full force while Mr. Flores was under 
contract to the Patriots.11  Defs. Mem. at 18–20.  The Court disagrees.   
    Despite the long historic narrative in the Amended Complaint reciting historical racism in 

the NFL, the gravamen of Mr. Flores’s claim is not that the NFL is generally racist.  Rather, Mr. 
Flores claims that specific adverse employment decisions were driven by discriminatory animus 
harbored by the NFL and member teams.  Defendants’ argument, taken to its logical extreme, 
would bind a coach forever to arbitration, even if he were never again employed by a team in the 
NFL, so long as the NFL had a practice of inflicting similar harm on other coaches while that 
coach was under contract.  Defendants cite no cases, and research has revealed none, that 
endorse the idea of an endless agreement to arbitrate future disputes with legally distinct entities. 
              2. Mr. Flores’s Claims Against the Miami Dolphins          
    Mr. Flores alleges that the Dolphins discriminated against him while he was employed by 
the Dolphins and shortly thereafter.  The employment contract between Mr. Flores and the 

Dolphins provides that “all matters in dispute” between Mr. Flores and the Dolphins “including, 
without limitation, any dispute arising from the terms of this Agreement, Employee’s 
employment with the Club, or otherwise, shall be referred to the Commissioner of the NFL for 

would be unenforceable for unconscionability under Florida law.  See Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 2 (“Flores-Dolphins 
Agreement”), Dkt. 73 § 19 (selecting Florida law).  Mr. Flores had no power to modify the NFL Constitution, and 
Defendants did not commit to providing Mr. Flores notice of any changes to the NFL Constitution.  See Flores-
Dolphins Agreement § 7.1 (“Employee . . . agrees . . . to be bound by[] the Constitution, Bylaws, and the Rules and 
Regulations of the NFL (as they now exist or as they may be amended) . . . .”); Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 1 (“NFL 
Const. & Bylaws”), Dkt. 73 Art. 25 (setting forth the procedures for amendment of the NFL Constitution).  Courts 
applying Florida law have held that a contract is illusory, and thus, unenforceable, where one party can modify the 
terms of that contract without notifying the other party.  See Diverse Elements, Inc. v. Ecommerce, Inc., 5 F. Supp. 
3d 1378, 1382 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (collecting cases); Centennial Bank v. ServisFirst Bank, Inc., 2022 WL 10219893, at 
*31 (M.D. Fla., Oct. 10, 2022) (“[A] contract once entered into may not thereafter be unilaterally modified as
subsequent modifications require consent . . . .”  Id. at *31 (citations omitted)).
11   Defendants make a similar argument with respect to Mr. Flores’s claims against the Giants and the Texans, 
see Defs. Mem., Dkt. 48 at 18–20, which the Court rejects for the same reasons. 
binding arbitration . . . .”  Flores-Dolphins Agreement § 12.2.  Mr. Flores does not dispute that 
this agreement was binding or that his claims alleging discrimination while he was a coach and 
when he was fired fall within the scope of his arbitration agreement with the Dolphins.  He 
argues, however, that his claims regarding the Dolphins’ retaliatory conduct after he was fired do 

not fall within the scope of the contract’s arbitration agreement.  Pls. Opp. at 25.   
    There is a “presumption in favor of postexpiration arbitration of matters . . . arising out of 
the relation governed by the contract.”  Litton Fin. Printing Div., a Div. of Litton Bus. Sys., Inc. 
v.N.L.R.B., 501 U.S. 190, 204 (1991) (internal citation omitted); see also Doctors Assocs., Inc. v.
Thomas, 898 So.2d 159, 162 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005) (arbitration agreements govern disputes 
arising after the termination of a contract that does not explicitly exclude post-termination 
disputes).                                                                
    Mr. Flores’s retaliation claim against the Dolphins is subject to arbitration because it 
clearly arises from his employment with the club.  Florida courts have interpreted the “arising 
from” requirement to require arbitration of an employee’s claims where the “breach in question 

was an immediate, foreseeable result of the performance of contractual duties.”  Doe v. Princess 
Cruise Lines, Ltd., 657 F.3d 1204, 1218 (11th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation omitted); see also 
Maglana v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., No. 20-14206, 2022 WL 3134373, at *4–5 (11th Cir. Aug. 5, 
2022); Phillips v. NCL Corp. Ltd., 824 F. App’x 675, 679 (11th Cir. 2020). 
    Disputes regarding the payment of wages or the terms of separation are “a fairly direct 
result of the performance of contractual duties” in an employment relationship.  Telecom Italia, 
SpA v. Wholesale Telecom Corp., 248 F.3d 1109, 1116 (11th Cir. 2001) (noting that an 
“intentional failure to perform the contract” is subject to arbitration).  Upon embarking on an 
employment relationship, both employee and employer can anticipate that the employee may be 
fired and that disputes may arise regarding an employee’s wages or the employer’s retaliatory 
conduct.                                                                  
    In Milestone v. Citrus Specialty Grp., Inc., No. 19-CV-2341, 2019 WL 5887179, at *2 
(M.D. Fla. Nov. 12, 2019), the court found that an employee’s claims of discrimination and 

retaliation were arbitrable under Florida law because “the claims were dependent upon the 
plaintiffs’ employment’s status and could not be brought in the absence of the employment 
relationship governed by the agreements.”  Id. (quoting McAdoo v. New Line Transp., LLC, No. 
16-CV-1917, 2017 WL 942114, at *4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 9, 2017) (cleaned up); see also Ravelo v.
Shutts & Bowen, LLP, No. 09-CV-865, 2009 WL 1587272, at *1–2 (M.D. Fla. July 11, 2009) 
(holding that plaintiffs’ racial discrimination and retaliation claims were subject to arbitration).  
              3. Mr. Flores’s Claims Against the Giants and Texans       
    Defendants argue that the arbitration clause in Mr. Flores’s contract with the Steelers 
applies retroactively to any claims accrued against the NFL or member teams before he was 
hired by the Steelers.  Defs. Mem. at 20 n.3.  Even if the Defendants are correct on that point, 

Defendants have failed to establish that Mr. Flores entered into a valid arbitration agreement 
when he was hired by the Steelers.                                        
    The Flores-Steelers Agreement required the approval of the NFL Commissioner before it 
became effective.  See Flores-Steelers Agreement § 12 (“This Agreement shall become valid and 
binding upon each party only when and if it shall be approved by the Commissioner of the 
NFL.”).  The version of the Flores-Steelers Agreement submitted to the Court never became 
binding upon Mr. Flores or the Steelers because the Commissioner never signed it.  See Flores-
Steelers Agreement at 7.                                                  
    In their June 21, 2022, brief, Defendants noted that the contract was still awaiting the 
Commissioner’s approval; more than a year after the contract’s purported effective date, 
Defendants have failed to provide the Court with any evidence that the contract has been 
approved by Commissioner Goodell.  See Defs. Mem. at 9.  On February 1, 2023, the Court 

ordered Defendants to re-submit Plaintiffs’ contracts due to omissions in the original 
submissions, see Order, Dkt. 70; Defendants once again submitted a version of the Flores-
Steelers Agreement that lacked Commissioner Goodell’s signature and attested that it was “a true 
and correct copy” of the Agreement, see Second DiBella Decl., Dkt. 73 ¶ 5; Flores-Steelers 
Agreement at 7.                                                           
    “The party seeking to stay the case in favor of arbitration bears an initial burden of 
demonstrating that an agreement to arbitrate was made.”  Hines v. Overstock.com, Inc., 380 F. 
App’x 22, 24 (2d Cir. 2010) (collecting cases).  Even where the party opposing arbitration admits 
that he is subject to an arbitration agreement, the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating 
that a valid arbitration agreement exists.  See Dreyfuss v. Etelecare Glob. Sols.-U.S. Inc., 349 F. 

App’x 551, 552–53 (2d Cir. 2009).  Defendants have failed to carry that burden with respect to 
Mr. Flores’s claims against the Giants and Texans because they have failed to prove that an 
arbitration agreement was in effect when or after Mr. Flores was being considered for hire by 
those teams.  See id.  Accordingly, Mr. Flores may litigate his claims against the Giants and 
Texans, and his related claims against the NFL, in federal court.12       




12   Because the Court finds that at least some claims may proceed in federal court, it need not address whether 
the arbitration agreement requires arbitration on an individual basis, as Mr. Flores retains the ability to pursue a class 
action in federal court.                                                  
         B. Steve Wilks                                                  
    Mr. Wilks signed an employment agreement with the Cardinals in which both the 
Cardinals and Mr. Wilks agreed to arbitrate “all disputes, claims or controversies that exist or 
that may arise between them.”  Wilks-Cardinals Agreement § 10(a).  Mr. Wilks also agreed to 

arbitrate “any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.”  Id. § 10(e).   
    Where, as here, the parties have agreed that the arbitrator will decide issues regarding 
whether the arbitration agreement is “void or voidable,” they have “clearly and unmistakably” 
delegated to the arbitrator the power to determine whether their dispute is subject to arbitration.  
See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc., 561 U.S. at 66, 69–70 (delegating arbitrability dispute where the 
delegation clause encompassed claims regarding whether the arbitration agreement was “void or 
voidable”); see also Ward v. Ernst & Young U.S. LLP, 468 F. Supp. 3d 596, 603 (S.D.N.Y. 
2020) (same).  This includes the power to decide whether the arbitration agreement as a whole is 
unenforceable for unconscionability or any other applicable contract defense.  See Rent-A-
Center, West, Inc., 561 U.S. at 73–75.                                    

    Because neither party discussed the delegation clause in their original submissions, on 
February 1, 2023, the Court ordered supplemental briefing regarding the enforceability of the 
delegation provision.  See Order, Dkt. 70 at 2.  In response, Mr. Wilks argued that Defendants 
had waived their right to seek arbitration of the threshold question of arbitrability by failing to 
raise the issue in their moving papers or reply and that allowing the Commissioner to decide the 
threshold issue of arbitrability would be operationally problematic and unconscionable.  Pls. 
Supp. Br., Dkt. 75 at 1.  Defendants’ failure to raise the issue does not constitute a waiver of their 
right to enforce the delegation clause, and neither of Plaintiffs’ other arguments is persuasive. 
    The Supreme Court has recently made clear that federal courts should not condition 
waiver of the right to compel arbitration on a showing of prejudice; instead, the Court held that 
the focus must be on the defendants’ conduct.  See Morgan v. Sundance, 142 S. Ct. 1708, 1712–
13 (2022).  Following Morgan, the Second Circuit has held that delay alone — even a delay of 

nearly three years — is insufficient to constitute waiver when the parties had not engaged in 
substantive litigation before the defendant belatedly sought arbitration.  Nicosia v. Amazon.com, 
Inc., No. 21-2624, 2023 WL 309545, at *4 n.2 (2d Cir. Jan. 19, 2023).13   
    Consequently, the fact that Defendants failed to raise the issue of the delegation clause 
for nearly eight months after their opening brief was filed (and then only when prompted by the 
Court) does not waive their right to enforce the delegation clause when no other substantive 
litigation has occurred.  “Mere silence, oversight or thoughtlessness . . . is insufficient to support 
an inference of waiver.”  Herrera v. Manna 2nd Ave. LLC, No. 20-CV-11026, 2022 WL 
2819072, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2022); see also Powell v. Vroom, Inc., No. 22-CV-302, 2022 
WL 4096872, at *7 (N.D. Ala. Sept. 7, 2022) (holding that defendant did not waive its right to 

enforce the delegation clause in the parties’ contract by initially submitting the threshold 
question of delegation to the court).  Furthermore, “any doubt concerning the scope of arbitrable 
issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,” including “allegation of waiver . . . .”  Moses 
H.Cone Mem. Hosp., 460 U.S. at 24–25.                                     
    Plaintiffs finally argue that allowing Commissioner Goodell to arbitrate any threshold 
questions of arbitrability would be unconscionable because he will inevitably be biased.  Pls. 

13   Plaintiffs contend that because the Wilks-Cardinals agreement selects Arizona law, Arizona law governs 
the question of waiver.  See Second DiBella Decl. Ex. 5 (“Wilks-Cardinals Agreement”), Dkt. 73 § 23; Pls. Supp. 
Br., Dkt 75 at 1, 1 n.1.  Plaintiffs are incorrect.  Whether Defendants waived their right to compel arbitration is 
governed by federal waiver law, and, thus, the issue is controlled by the law of this circuit.  See Morgan v. 
Sundance, 142 S. Ct. 1708, 1712–13 (2022).                                
Supp. Br. at 4.  Plaintiffs have not pointed to a single case, and research has revealed none, that 
applied Arizona law to find that an arbitration agreement was unenforceable because there was a 
risk that the arbitrator the parties jointly selected may be biased.14  Rather, Arizona courts have 
focused on whether the arbitration provision is “fundamentally unfair” because it “grants one 

party to the arbitration unilateral control over the pool of arbitrators.”  Arnold v. Standard Pac. of 
Ariz. Inc., No. 16-CV-452, 2016 WL 4259762, at *3 (D. Ariz. Aug. 12, 2016) (citing McMullen 
v.Meijer, Inc., 355 F.3d 485, 494 (6th Cir. 2004)) (cleaned up); see also Gullet on behalf of
Estate of Gullet v. Kindred Nursing Ctrs. W., L.L.C., 390 P.3d 378, 359 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2017) 
(holding that arbitration was not substantively unconscionable for lack of neutrality where, inter 
alia, the employer did not have unilateral control over the arbitration selection process).  
    Because arbitration is a matter of contract, Plaintiffs cannot ask the Court to provide them 
with an arbitrator who is more neutral than the one to whom they agreed.  See Nat’l Football 
League Mgmt. Council v. Nat’l Football League Players Ass’n, 820 F.3d 527, 548 (2d Cir. 
2016).  Indeed, the Arizona legislature has only precluded individuals with “a known, direct and 

material interest in the outcome of the arbitration proceeding” from serving as an arbitrator 
where the agreement itself requires the arbitrator to be neutral.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 12-3011(B). 
         C. Ray Horton                                                   
    Mr. Horton’s employment contract with the Tennessee Titans, which was in effect when 
he interviewed for the Titans’ head coach position, states: “all matters in dispute between [Mr. 




14   Because the Court finds that it would not be unconscionable for Commissioner Goodell to serve as the 
arbitrator, it follows that it is not “operationally problematic” to allow Commissioner Goodell to make the threshold 
determination of whether arbitration of the dispute should be delegated to JAMS.  Pls. Supp. Br., Dkt. 75 at 4–5.   
Horton] and Titans shall be referred to the Commissioner . . . . ”  Horton-Titans Agreement 
§6(a).15                                                                  
    Mr. Horton argues that clause is insufficient to constitute an arbitration agreement.  Pls. 
Opp. at 4 n.2.  It is, of course, black letter law that a contract does not have to use the word 

“arbitration” in order to be an arbitration agreement.  See McDonnell Douglas Fin. Corp v. Penn. 
Power & Light Co., 858 F.2d 825, 830 (2d Cir. 1988).  The Second Circuit has held that an 
agreement that “manifests an intention by the parties to submit certain disputes to a specified 
third party for binding resolution” is an arbitration agreement.”16  Id.; see also Bakoss v. Certain 
Underwriters at Lloyds of London Issuing Certificate No. 0510135, 707 F.3d 140, 143 (2d Cir. 
2013).  Mr. Horton’s contract with the Titans, bare bones though it may be, satisfies those 
requirements: the parties agreed to submit any disputes to the NFL Commissioner and that his 
decision would be binding.  See Horton-Titans Agreement § 6(a).           
    Mr. Horton’s claims against the Titans clearly fall within the scope of the arbitration 
agreement, which broadly encompasses “all matters in dispute” between Mr. Horton and the 

Titans.  Horton-Titans Agreement § 6(a).  Plaintiffs do not argue otherwise.  Accordingly, there 
is a valid arbitration agreement applicable to Mr. Horton’s claims against the Titans.  


15   While Defendants assert that Mr. Horton is also subject to arbitration pursuant to the NFL Constitution as 
incorporated into the Horton-Titans Agreement, the only version of the NFL Constitution that is in the record did not 
go into effect until September 2016, after Mr. Horton was no longer employed by the Titans.  See Second DiBella 
Decl., Dkt. 73 ¶ 2; Am. Compl. ¶ 266.  Thus, there is no record evidence of an arbitration provision in the NFL 
Constitution would encompass Mr. Horton’s claim against the Titans.       
16   Although the applicable state law governs questions of contract formation, the Second Circuit has held that 
courts should apply federal common law in determining whether the form of alternative dispute resolution to which 
the parties have agreed is arbitration as contemplated by the FAA.  See Bakoss v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyds of 
London Issuing Certificate No. 0510135, 707 F.3d 140, 143 (2d Cir. 2013) (“[F]ederal common law provides the 
definition of ‘arbitration’ under the FAA.”); but see Portland Gen. Elec. Co. v. U.S. Bank Trust Nat. Ass’n as Tr. for 
Trust No. 1, 218 F.3d 1085, 1086 (9th Cir. 2000) (courts should look to state law in defining arbitration). 
    II.  The Arbitration Agreements Apply to Plaintiffs’ Claims Against the NFL
    Plaintiffs argue that their arbitration agreements with the hiring teams do not apply to 
their disputes with the NFL because the arbitration agreements in the parties’ contracts and the 
NFL Constitution do not explicitly include claims against the NFL.  Pls. Opp. at 19.  The 

applicable state laws, however, estop Plaintiffs from avoiding arbitration of their claims against 
the NFL in light of their allegations that the NFL and the Defendant teams were jointly engaged 
in the alleged discrimination and retaliation.  See Doe v. Trump Corp., 6 F.4th 400, 412 n.8 (2d 
Cir. 2021) (“[S]tate law governs whether a non-signatory may enforce an arbitration clause.”  Id. 
(citation omitted)).17                                                    
    The Amended Complaint not only alleges that the NFL is a joint employer with the 
Defendant teams but that the discrimination experienced by Black players and coaches was a 
product of collusion among NFL teams and the NFL.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 337–53; cf. State ex 
rel. Hewitt v. Kerr, 461 S.W.3d 798, 814 (Mo. 2015) (en banc) (enforcing plaintiff’s arbitration 
agreement with the St. Louis Rams Partnership against non-signatories, including the St. Louis 

Rams, L.L.C., when plaintiffs brought allegations against defendants collectively).  Throughout 
the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs treat the NFL and its member teams “as a single unit;” they 
cannot now claim that the two entities are distinct in order to avoid arbitration.  Smith/Enron 
Cogeneration Ltd. P’ship, Inc. v. Smith Cogeneration Int’l, Inc., 198 F.3d 88, 98 (2d Cir. 1999) 

17   Plaintiffs’ reliance on Doe v. Trump Corp., 6 F.4th 400 (2d Cir. 2021), is misplaced.  As an initial matter, 
in refusing to grant the defendants’ motion to compel arbitration, the Doe court relied heavily on the fact that the 
third-party Trump defendants had not signed the relevant contracts; here, the NFL Commissioner signed the 
contracts that will be enforced.  See id. at 412–13; see also, e.g., Flores-Dolphins Agreement at 11.  Furthermore, the 
Second Circuit explained that arbitration was generally appropriate against third parties that “had some sort of 
corporate relationship to a signatory party,” contrasting that situation to cases in which one signatory is unaware of 
the relationship between the other signatory and the third party that is seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement.  
Doe, 6 F.4th at 413; see also id. at 414.  The coaches were undoubtedly aware of the relationship between the NFL 
and the teams.                                                            
(plaintiffs could not avoid arbitration with non-signatories where the complaint treated 
signatories and non-signatories alike).                                   
    “[C]ourts around the country have almost uniformly concluded” that a party to the 
contract is estopped from avoiding arbitration where a plaintiff brings claims against the other 

party and a nonparty who jointly controlled his employment and engaged in the alleged 
misconduct.18  Green v. Mission Health Cmtys., LLC, 20-CV-439, 2020 WL 6702866, at *8 
(M.D. Tenn. Nov. 13, 2020) (internal quotation omitted) (applying Tennessee law to find that an 
employee was equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration when she alleged that her joint 
employers engaged in misconduct); see also Gunson v. BMO Harris Bank, N.A., 43 F. Supp. 3d 
1396, 1401, 1403 (S.D. Fla. 2014) (applying Florida law to compel arbitration of claims against 
non-signatories where plaintiff’s claims arose from the joint misconduct of contractual party and 
non-signatory);  Kolsky v. Jackson Square, LLC, 28 So.3d 965, 969 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2010) 
(same); Machado v. System4 LLC, 28 N.E.3d 401, 409 (Mass. 2013) (plaintiffs were equitably 
estopped from avoiding arbitration when plaintiffs “lumped the two defendants together, 

asserting each claim in their complaint against [them] collectively,” id. at 412). 
    III. The Arbitration Agreements Are Enforceable Except as to Mr. Flores’s
         Claims Against the Broncos                                      
    Plaintiffs argue that, even if they agreed to arbitrate their claims against the Defendant 
teams and the NFL, the agreements are unconscionable, particularly because Commissioner 


18   Section 11(d) of the Horton-Titans Agreement selects Tennessee law.  Although Tennessee state courts 
have yet to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to cases in which the plaintiff alleges that a non-party engaged in 
misconduct with a party to the contract, at least one Tennessee appeals court has recognized the prevalence of this 
doctrine in other courts.  See Blue Water Bay at Ctr. Hill, LLC v. Hasty, 2017 WL 5665410, at *14 n.12 (Tenn. App. 
Ct. Nov. 27, 2017) (noting that “many courts” apply the doctrine of estoppel when the plaintiff alleges “concerted 
misconduct by a nonsignatory and one or more signatories to the contract”).   
Goodell would serve as the arbitrator and has the discretion to alter the arbitration rules.19  See 
Pls. Opp. at 5.  For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that all the applicable arbitration 
agreements are enforceable except the arbitration agreement in the NFL Constitution as 
incorporated in Mr. Flores’s contract with the New England Patriots to the extent that it applies 

to his claim that the Broncos’ failure to hire him was discriminatory.    
         A. Defendants Cannot Compel Mr. Flores to Arbitrate His Claims Against
           the Broncos                                                   
    Mr. Flores’s contract with the Patriots required him to comply with the NFL Constitution, 
including its arbitration provision, in its “present form and as amended from time to time 
hereafter.”  See Flores-Patriot Agreement § 15.  Plaintiffs argue that the arbitration agreement in 
the NFL Constitution is unenforceable because the NFL is not required to provide Plaintiffs 
notice of any changes that it may make to the NFL Constitution.20  See Pls. Opp. at 9.  The Court 
agrees.                                                                   
    The NFL and its member clubs have the unilateral ability to modify the terms of the NFL 
Constitution.  See NFL Const. & Bylaws Art. 25 (setting forth the procedures for amendment of 
the NFL Constitution).  Under Massachusetts law, which applies to Mr. Flores’s contract with 
the Patriots, see Flores-Patriots Agreement § 21, if “the party seeking to enforce the arbitration 
provision retain[s] the unilateral discretion to alter its terms, without notice, the agreement to 


19   Defendants suggest that, pursuant to the NFL’s arbitration rules, at least some of Plaintiffs’ claims may be 
arbitrated by JAMS.  Defs. Mem. at 8.  Plaintiffs argue that the instant disputes are not eligible to be referred to 
JAMS under JAMS’s rules.  Pls. Opp. at 17.  The Court need not address this argument because delegation to JAMS 
appears to be discretionary, and thus, whether it is available is of no moment.  See Flores-Dolphins Agreement Ex. 
A (“NFL Dispute Resolution Procedural Guidelines”), Dkt. 73 ¶ 1.7.        
20   The Court does not address this argument for Plaintiffs’ other claims.  Defendants need to rely on the NFL 
Constitution only for Mr. Flores’s claims against the Broncos, as all other claims for which there is a valid 
arbitration agreement are also subject to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreements contained in the Plaintiffs’ 
contracts with the Defendant teams.  See supra, section I–II.             
arbitrate is illusory and unenforceable,” Fawcett v. Citizens Bank, N.A., 297 F. Supp. 3d 213, 221 
(D. Mass. 2018) (internal quotation omitted) (collecting cases).  See also Jackson v. Action for 
Boston Cmty. Dev., Inc., 525 N.E.2d 411, 415 (Mass. 1988) (the unilateral right to amend 
arbitration rules without notice renders any “‘offer’ made by the defendant . . . illusory”); Bekele 

v.Lyft, Inc., 918 F.3d 181, 189–90 (1st Cir. 2019) (enforcing contract modifiable by Lyft
because Lyft was required to provide users notice and an opportunity to reject the contract).   
    Because there is no enforceable arbitration agreement governing Mr. Flores’s claims 
against the Denver Broncos and his related claims against the NFL, Mr. Flores may litigate those 
claims in federal court.                                                  
         B. Possible Arbitrator Bias Does Not Invalidate the Arbitration Agreements
    Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Goodell could not possibly serve as a neutral arbitrator because 
“Mr. Goodell, as the Commissioner, is the NFL in all regards.”  Pls. Opp. at 6.  As evidence of 
Mr. Goodell’s bias, Plaintiffs rely heavily on a statement released by the NFL on the day that Mr. 
Flores filed his complaint, in which the NFL stated that Mr. Flores’s claims were “without 
merit.”  See Am. Compl. ¶ 3; Wigdor Decl. Ex. 2, Dkt. 63.                 

    “[A]rbitration is a matter of contract, and consequently, the parties to an arbitration can 
ask for no more impartiality than inheres in the method they have chosen.”  Nat’l Football 
League Mgmt. Council, 820 F.3d at 548.  In the context of litigation arising out of allegations 
that the Patriots underinflated the balls used they used in the American Football Conference 
Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts in 2015, the Second Circuit rejected the 
argument that, as a matter of law, the NFL Commissioner cannot fairly arbitrate claims regarding 
the NFL’s conduct.  See id. at 532–33, 548.  As the Court noted, the parties contracted to 
arbitrate claims before the NFL Commissioner “knowing full well . . . that the Commissioner 
would have a stake both in the underlying discipline and in every arbitration brought.”  Id. at 
548. Accordingly, the Second Circuit declined to indulge allegations that the NFL
Commissioner could not “adjudicate the propriety of his own conduct.”  Id. 
    The Court acknowledges that this structure creates a risk of biased adjudication and that 
the NFL statement on the day the case was filed is worrisome.  Plaintiffs’ descriptions of their 

experiences of racial discrimination — which allegedly are only the most recent chapter in the 
NFL’s long history of systematic discrimination toward Black players, coaches, and managers — 
are incredibly troubling.  Am. Compl. ¶ 4.  Given the number of Black men who play and coach 
football, it is difficult to understand how it could be that, at the time Plaintiffs initiated this 
lawsuit, “the NFL had only one Black Head Coach.” 21  Id. ¶ 6.            
    Nevertheless, the FAA cautions against judicial intervention at this early stage when 
Plaintiffs have, as here, agreed to a particular arbitration structure, including a specific arbitrator.  
Courts must avoid presupposing that the selected arbitrator will not serve as a conscientious and 
impartial arbitrator.  See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 30 (1991) (“We 
decline to indulge the presumption that the parties and arbitrable body conducting a proceeding 

will be unable or unwilling to retain . . . impartial arbitrators.”  Id. (cleaned up));  Nat’l Football 
League Mgmt. Council, 820 F.3d at 548.  If the NFL Commissioner is, indeed, improperly 
biased, and that bias prevents him from fairly adjudicating Plaintiffs’ claims, Plaintiffs have a 
recourse: this Court retains the authority to review the Commissioner’s decision and to vacate the 
Commissioner’s award.  See 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(2) (permitting courts to overturn arbitration 
decisions where there is “evident partiality or corruption”).             

21   In both the NFL and the National Basketball Association (“NBA”), “about 70% of the players are Black.”  
Scott Neuman, Why a 20-Year Effort by the NFL Hasn’t Led to More Minorities in Top Coaching Jobs, NPR (Feb. 
3, 2022), https://www.npr.org/2022/02/03/1075520411/rooney-rule-nfl.  When Mr. Flores filed the Complaint, 
thirteen of the thirty head coaches in the NBA were Black; at that same time, only one of the thirty-two head 
coaches in the NFL was Black.  See id.  Thus, at the time this lawsuit was filed, the percentage of NBA Black head 
coaches (43%) was more than thirteen times than the percentage of NFL Black head coaches (3.1%).    
    Plaintiffs also argue that Commissioner Goodell’s alleged bias would prevent them from 
effectively vindicating their claim in a forum in which he is the arbitrator.  See Pls. Opp. at 15–
17. The effective vindication doctrine is “a judge-made exception to the FAA” that “finds its
origins in the desire to prevent prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue statutory 

remedies.”  Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228, 235–236 (2013) (internal 
quotation omitted).                                                       
    The Supreme Court has recognized two types of arbitration agreements to which this 
doctrine may apply: an agreement “forbidding the assertion of certain statutory rights” and an 
agreement imposing arbitration fees “so high as to make access to the forum impracticable.”  Id. 
at 236; see also Reyes v. Gracefully, Inc., 2018 WL 2209486, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 11, 2018) 
(holding that an arbitration agreement could not shorten the statute of limitations for FLSA 
claims).  Alleged structural bias falls into neither category.22  Moreover, the Supreme Court has 
noted that while several Supreme Court “cases have . . . asserted the existence of an ‘effective 
vindication’ exception,” these cases have simultaneously “declined to apply it to invalidate the 
arbitration agreement at issue.”  Am. Express Co., 570 U.S. at 235.23     

    Plaintiffs also argue that the risk that Commissioner Goodell will be biased renders the 
arbitration agreements unconscionable as a matter of state contract law.  To support this 

22   Cole v. Burns International Security Services, et al., 105 F.3d 1465 (D.C. Cir. 1997), is not to the contrary.  
Although the court noted that access to neutral arbitrators was one of several factors relevant to assessing whether 
plaintiffs could effectively vindicate their claims, see id. at 1482, the parties had agreed to use a neutral arbitrator, 
see id. at 1480.  The Cole court gave no indication that lack of access to a neutral arbitrator was dispositive when the 
parties had agreed to a specific arbitrator.  And although the Sixth Circuit in Floss v. Ryan’s Family Steak Houses, 
Inc., 211 F.3d 306 (6th Cir. 2000), expressed concern that bias in the makeup of the arbitral panel would preclude 
the effective vindication of plaintiffs’ claims, it expressly did not resolve that question because it found that the 
arbitration agreement was illusory.  See id. at 314–15.                   
23   See Am. Exp. Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228, 242 (2013) (Kagan, J. dissenting) (warning that the 
Supreme Court’s limited application of the effective vindication doctrine to arbitration agreements that “operate to” 
bar federal claims enables companies to “appoint as an arbitrator an obviously biased person — say, the CEO. . . .”). 
argument, Plaintiffs rely heavily on Hooters of America v. Phillips, 173 F.3d 933 (4th Cir. 1999), 
and related cases in the Sixth Circuit.  Pls. Opp. at 11–14.  Those cases are, however, inapposite 
as they all concerned arbitration agreements with unfair selection procedures that, inter alia, 
granted the employer improper control over the pool of arbitrators.       

    The Hooters court refused to enforce an arbitration agreement that required all arbitrators 
to be selected from a list prepared by Hooters and thereby granted it “unrestricted control” over 
the selection of arbitrators.  See id. at 939.  And in McMullen v. Meijier, Inc., 355 F.3d 485 (6th 
Cir. 2004), the court refused to enforce the parties’ arbitration agreement based on “procedural 
unfairness inherent in an arbitration agreement,” while noting that the “preferred method of 
challenging allegations of bias is to pursue the underlying claims through the arbitration process 
and then seek review . . . .”  Id. at 494 n.7; see also id. at 488 (noting that the employer had “the 
right to unilaterally select a pool of . . . potential arbitrators”).  By contrast, Plaintiffs’ arbitration 
agreements grant Defendants no discretion over the choice of the arbitrator: it must be the NFL 
Commissioner.24                                                           

    The applicable state contract laws of Florida and Tennessee do not compel a different 
conclusion.25  In Garcia v. Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc., No. 18-
13452, 2021 WL 5074465, at *12 (11th Cir. Nov. 2, 2021), the Eleventh Circuit held that an 

24   Similarly, in Pokorny v. Quixtar, Inc., 601 F.3d 987 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit found that an 
arbitration agreement requiring plaintiffs to pay a fee if they selected an arbitrator who had not gone through 
defendants’ “training,” which was “designed to produce a very favorable view of [defendants],” unconscionably 
used the threat of financial hardship to give defendants control over the arbitrator selection process.  Id. at 1003 
(internal quotation omitted).                                             
25   Several cases, on state law grounds, have declined to enforce an arbitration agreement appointing the 
commissioner of a sports league as the arbitrator due to concerns of impropriety or bias.  See Order, Nostalgic 
Partners LLC v. New York Yankees P’ship, No. 656724/2020, at 2 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Dec. 17, 2021); State ex rel. 
Hewitt v. Kerr, 461 S.W.3d 798, 813–14 (Mo. 2015) (en banc); Gruden v. The Nat’l Football League, et al., No. A-
21-844043-B, at 13–14 (Nev. Dist. Ct. Clark Cty. Oct. 12, 2022).  Because none of the applicable contracts selects
Missouri, New York, or Nevada law, those cases are interesting but not controlling.
arbitration clause that required plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims against the Church of 
Scientology before individuals “in good standing” with the church was not unconscionable under 
Florida law — even in the face of the lead arbitrator making “various comments . . . reflecting 
bias in favor of the church.”  Id. at *12 (citing Nat’l Football League Mgmt. Council, 820 F.3d at 

548); see also id. at *8–9 (applying Florida law).                        
    In Walker v. Ryan’s Family Steak Houses, Inc., 400 F.3d 370 (6th Cir. 2005), the Sixth 
Circuit, applying Tennessee law, declined to enforce the arbitration agreement because the 
“arbitrator-selection process itself [was] fundamentally unfair,” while making clear the general 
rule that pre-arbitration challenges to an allegedly biased arbitration panel will not stand.  Id. at 
385 (“[A] party cannot avoid the arbitration process simply by alleging that the arbitration panel 
will be biased.”); see also Iysheh v. Cellular Sales of Tenn., LLC, No. 17-CV-542, 2018 WL 
2207122, at *8 (E.D. Tenn. May 14, 2018) (arbitration agreement was not unconscionable 
where, inter alia, both parties had an opportunity to participate in arbitrator selection). 
    In short, Plaintiffs’ concern about the Commissioner’s ability to decide fairly their claims 

is insufficient reason not to enforce the arbitration agreements.         
         C. Possible Discovery Limitations Do Not Render the Agreements  
           Unconscionable                                                
    Plaintiffs also complain that they will not be able to take robust discovery if they are 
compelled to arbitrate their disputes.  The fact that the NFL Commissioner may limit the amount 
of discovery Plaintiffs can take, however, is also not grounds for refusing to enforce the various 
arbitration agreements.  See Gilmer, 500 U.S. at 31 (limited discovery did not bar arbitration of 
plaintiff’s age discrimination claims).  While the Second Circuit has “recognized that a provision 
that deprived a claimant of a meaningful opportunity to present her claim might well be 
unenforceable,” plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating that the arbitration rules will in fact 
deprive them of a chance to prove their claims.  Lohnn v. Int’l Bus. Machs. Corp., No. 21-CV-
6379, 2022 WL 36420, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2022) (cleaned up) (quoting Guyden v. Aetna, 
Inc., 544 F.3d 376, 386–87 (2d Cir. 2008)).                               
    Plaintiffs have not carried that burden because they rely solely on speculation that 

Commissioner Goodell may interpret the arbitration rules in a manner that will improperly and 
unfairly limit the scope of discovery.  See Pls. Opp. at 6–7; see also PacifiCare Health Sys., Inc. 
v.Book, 538 U.S. 401, 406–07 (2003) (holding that courts should not decline to enforce
arbitration agreements “on the basis of mere speculation” that the arbitrator may interpret the 
arbitration agreement in a manner that will render it unenforceable, id. (internal quotation 
omitted)); AT&T Mobility LLC, 563 U.S. at 342 (cautioning that limitations on discovery should 
not be considered substantively unconscionable because that “rule would have a disproportionate 
impact on arbitration agreements”).26  If Plaintiffs are “unable to vindicate [their] rights in the 
arbitral forum, [they] will have recourse to the Court.”  Howard v. Anderson, 36 F. Supp. 2d 183, 
187 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (collecting cases); see also 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(3) (permitting courts to vacate 

arbitration awards where the arbitrator “refus[es] to hear evidence pertinent and material to the 
controversy”).                                                            
         D. The Horton-Titans Agreement Is Sufficiently Definite To Enforce
    Plaintiffs argue that the arbitration agreement between Mr. Horton and the Titans is 
unenforceable because it fails to set forth the essential terms of the arbitration process.  Pls. Opp. 
at 4 n.2.  Mr. Horton’s arbitration agreement with the Titans provides, in its entirety: “You and 
the Titans agree that all matters in dispute between You and Titans shall be referred to the 

26   Discovery in arbitration is not typically as extensive as federal court discovery; that reality is, of course, 
one reason many prefer arbitration over litigation.  Nevertheless, the Court takes the NFL at its word that it is 
committed to combating racism, Defs. Reply, Dkt. 64 at 5, and is confident that the Defendants recognize that the 
Plaintiffs have raised serious claims that may require more than minimal discovery to adjudicate fairly. 
Commissioner and his decision shall be accepted as final, complete, conclusive, binding and 
unappealable by You and Titans.”  Horton-Titans Agreement § 6(a).         
    Tennessee courts have held that “for a contract to be enforceable, it must be of sufficient 
explicitness so that a court can perceive what are the respective obligations of the parties,” and 

“any agreement which leaves unanswered . . . critical questions” is not enforceable.  Higgins v. 
Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Int’l Union, Local No. 3-677, 811 S.W.2d 875, 880 (Tenn. 
1991) (quoting Soar v. Nat’l Football League Players’ Ass’n, 550 F.2d 1287, 1290 (1st Cir. 
1977) (holding that the NFL Commissioner’s oral promise retroactively to provide pension 
benefits to retired NFL players was insufficiently definite)) (alterations omitted).   
    Although Mr. Horton’s arbitration agreement with the Titans is admittedly quite succinct, 
it is sufficiently definite to enforce.  Courts applying Tennessee law have found that a reference 
to “binding arbitration to resolve all disputes that may arise out of the employment context” is 
adequate to state the essential terms of the agreement.  Hayward v. Trinity Christian Ctr. of 
Santa Ana, No. 14-CV-2282, 2015 WL 1924552, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 28, 2015).27  Although 

the NFL Commissioner retains substantial discretion to set the arbitration procedures, the 
doctrines of good faith and fair dealing preclude the NFL from unilaterally adopting arbitration 
procedures that are “improper or oppressive.”  Howell v. Rivergate Toyota, Inc., 144 F. App’x 
475, 479 (6th Cir. 2005) (applying Tennessee law); see also Brubaker v. Barrett, 801 F. Supp. 2d 

27   Although Tennessee courts have been skeptical of contracts that provide “little notice as to the procedure” 
for arbitration, those contracts appear to have either been even more succinct than the one at issue here or contracts 
of adhesion.  For example, in Wofford v. M.J. Edwards & Sons Funeral Home Inc., 490 S.W.3d 800 (Tenn. Ct. App. 
Nov. 23, 2015), the contract did not indicate who the arbitrator would be or the “effect” of the arbitrator’s decision, 
i.e., that it would be binding and final, see id. at 822–23.  And while the court in Howell v. NHC Healthcare-Fort
Sanders, Inc., 109 S.W.3d 731, 734 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2003), invalidated the parties’ arbitration agreement in part
because it did “not adequately explain how the arbitration procedure would work, except as who would administer
it,” id. at 734, Tennessee courts have subsequently limited Howell’s holding to contracts of adhesion, see Wolfford,
490 S.W.3d at 817 n.13.                                                   
743, 753–55 (E.D. Tenn. 2011) (same).28  To the extent Commissioner Goodell adopts 
procedures that are improper or oppressive, Plaintiffs will have recourse to this Court.  
                          CONCLUSION                                     
    For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED 

except that it is DENIED as to Brian Flores’s claims against the Denver Broncos, New York 
Giants, and the Houston Texans, and his related claims against the NFL.  Defendants’ request to 
stay the case is DENIED as to Flores’s claims that may proceed to litigation and is GRANTED 
as to all of the claims that must be arbitrated.  The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to 
terminate the open motion at docket entry 47.                             
    The parties are ordered to appear for a pretrial conference on Friday, March 24, 2023, at 
10:00 A.M. in Courtroom 443 of the Thurgood Marshall Courthouse, 40 Foley Square, New 
York, New York, 10007.  By March 16, 2023, the parties must submit a joint letter regarding the 
status of the case, including:                                            
    a. a statement of all existing deadlines, due dates, and/or cut-off dates;

    b. a statement describing the status of any settlement discussions and whether the parties
      would like a settlement conference;                                
    c. a statement of the anticipated length of trial and whether the case is to be tried to a
      jury;                                                              
    d. a statement regarding the anticipated schedule of arbitration;    
    e. any contemplated motions;                                         

28   Floss v. Ryan’s Family Steakhouse, 211 F.3d 306 (6th Cir. 2000), is not to the contrary.  “In Floss, the 
arbitration agreement was between employees and a third-party arbitration service, not the employer . . . . In other 
words, the promise of the third party was too indefinite for legal enforcement.”  Vision Healthcare Sys. (Int’l) Pty, 
Ltd. v. Vision Software Techs. Inc., No. 15-CV-175, 2015 WL 2404089, at *3 (M.D. Tenn. May 20, 2015) (citing 
Floss, 211 F.3d at 315–16) (upholding arbitration agreement that stated, in relevant part, “arbitration shall take place 
in Nashville . . . before one arbitrator” without detailing further procedures, id. at *1).   
     f.   a proposed schedule for discovery, which must comply with the guidance set forth in 
        the Court’s model Civil Case Management Plan and Scheduling Order, available on 
        the Court’s website; 
     g.  any other issue that the parties would like to address at the pretrial conference; and 
     h.  any other information that the parties believe may assist the Court in advancing the 
        case to settlement or trial. 

SO ORDERED.                                                              □

VALERIE CAPRONI, United States District Judge:                            
    Three individuals who have been coaches in the National Football League (“NFL”) have 
sued the NFL and several of its teams for discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the 
New York State Human Rights Law, the New York City Human Rights Law, and the New 
Jersey Law Against Discrimination.  Am. Compl., Dkt. 22.  Defendants moved to compel 
arbitration and to stay the current proceedings.  Mot. to Compel Arbitration, Dkt. 47.  Plaintiffs 
moved for discovery in advance of their anticipated response to the motion to compel arbitration, 
Mot. for Discovery, Dkt. 54, and Defendants opposed the motion, Defs. Resp., Dkt 55.  For the 
reasons stated below, Plaintiffs’ motion for discovery is DENIED.         
                         BACKGROUND                                      
    Plaintiffs Brian Flores, Steve Wilks, and Ray Horton are coaches in the NFL.  Each of 
them have allegedly experienced “systemic racial discrimination” in the course of their 
employment relationship with the NFL.  Am. Compl., Dkt. 22 ¶ 1.  On February 1, 2022, Mr. 

Flores filed this putative class action alleging that the NFL discriminates against minority 
coaches, including by interviewing them for head coaching positions solely to fulfill the “Rooney 
Rule,” an internal requirement to interview minority candidates for select leadership positions, 
without intending to hire them.  Id. at ¶¶ 44–112, 118–19, 178–206.  Mr. Flores further alleges 
that the NFL retaliated against him for bringing this lawsuit.  Id. at ¶¶ 207–26.  In an amended 
complaint filed on April 7, 2022, Plaintiffs Steve Wilks and Ray Horton brought additional 
claims of discrimination.  Mr. Wilks alleges that he “was not given any meaningful chance to 
succeed” as a coach for the Arizona Cardinals and was “discriminatorily fired.”  Id. at ¶ 19.  Mr. 
Horton alleges that, like Mr. Flores, he was only offered head coach interviews to comply with 
the Rooney Rule and was never actually considered as a candidate for head coach.  Id. at ¶¶ 22–

25, 267.                                                                  
    On June 21, 2022, Defendants moved to compel arbitration and to stay the current 
proceedings based on arbitration agreements contained in Plaintiffs’ employment contracts and 
in the NFL’s constitution, which was referenced in those contracts.  Mot. to Compel Arb., Dkt. 
47; Defs. Mem. of Law, Dkt. 48 at 6–9.  On July 1, 2022, Plaintiffs moved for discovery on the 
motion to compel arbitration, seeking documents concerning the parties’ agreement to arbitrate 
and applicable arbitration policies, the arbitrator’s relationship with the NFL and his history of 
arbitration rulings, as well as the NFL’s relationship with NFL teams.  Mot. for Discovery, Dkt. 
54.  On July 8, 2022, Defendants opposed Plaintiffs’ motion for discovery.  Defs. Resp., Dkt. 55. 
                       LEGAL STANDARD                                    
    Although the Court evaluates a motion to compel arbitration under a “standard similar to 
that of a summary judgment action,” Aleksanian v. Uber Techs. Inc., 524 F. Supp. 3d 251, 258 
(S.D.N.Y. 2021), the standards for evaluating discovery requests in the context of a motion for 

summary judgment and a motion to compel arbitration are not similar.  While the Court 
evaluates the motion to compel arbitration in the context of any “discovery materials before the 
Court,” Ryan v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 924 F. Supp. 2d 559, 562 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2013), the 
Court does not compel the production of discovery materials as freely as it may when deciding a 
motion for summary judgment.  In the face of a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff is 
almost always entitled to discovery before summary judgment can be granted against it.  See 
Hellstrom v. U.S. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 201 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir. 2000) (“Only in the rarest of 
cases may summary judgment be granted against a plaintiff who has not been afforded the 
opportunity to conduct discovery.”).  In contrast, given the “strong federal policy favoring 
arbitration as an alternative means of dispute resolution,” Ross v. Am. Express Co., 547 F.3d 137, 

142 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation omitted), courts do not grant discovery requests related to 
a motion to compel arbitration as a matter of course.                     
    An agreement to arbitrate is binding on the parties unless the agreement is invalid under 
state contract law.  See Ciago v. Ameriquest Mortg. Co., 295 F. Supp. 2d 324, 328 (S.D.N.Y. 
2003).  Thus, on a motion to compel arbitration, the Court’s analysis is generally limited to 
determining whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate, whether one party has failed to 
perform its duties under that agreement, and whether the agreement, properly interpreted, 
encompasses the dispute at hand.  See AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 344 
(2011) (citing 9 U.S.C. §§ 2–4).  This inquiry is not, however, as crabbed as Defendants suggest.  

See Def. Opp., Dkt. 55 at 1.  Once the parties establish that they agreed to arbitrate, courts must 
also determine whether there are any valid “grounds as exist at law or in equity for the 
revocation of any contract,” including unconscionability, that affect the arbitration agreement.  9 
U.S.C. § 2 (2020); see also Ciago, 295 F. Supp. 2d at 328 (noting the availability of 
unconscionability as a defense against a motion to compel arbitration).   

    Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, discovery on a motion to compel arbitration is 
appropriate “when the party opposing arbitration ‘comes forth with reliable evidence that is more 
than a naked assertion . . . that it did not intend to be bound’ by the arbitration agreement, even 
though on the face of the pleadings it appears that it did.”  Morton v. Maplebear, 2016 WL 
616343, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2016) (quoting Guidotti v. Legal Helpers Debt Resol., LLC, 716 
F.3d 764, 774 (3d Cir. 2013)) (cleaned up); see also AMC Ent. v. Entretenimineto GM de Mex. 
S.A. de C.V., 555 F. App’x 12, 14 (2d Cir. 2014).                         
                          DISCUSSION                                     
    Plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of offering “facts or evidence to place the 
validity of the [a]greement to arbitrate in issue” in their motion for discovery.  Morton, 2016 WL 

616343, at *5.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that they agreed to be bound by the arbitration agreement 
contained in their employment agreements.  Nor do Plaintiffs allege any grounds on which this 
Court may find their agreement to be invalid.  Instead, Plaintiffs seek “agreements between 
Plaintiffs and Defendants that might bear on the issue or arbitration” in part to determine whether 
any subsequent contract invalidated their agreement to arbitrate.  Mot. for Discovery, Dkt. 54 at 
2.  Because Plaintiffs should know whether they entered into any other contracts or agreements 
that would affect their agreement to arbitrate,1 the Court can only assume that they are 
attempting to embark on an impermissible fishing expedition.  See Olsen v. Charter Comms., 


1    In their Opposition, Defendants note that they provided copies of several of these agreements to Plaintiffs 
in April 2022.  Opp., Dkt. 55 at 2.                                       
Inc., 2019 WL 3779190, at *6–7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2019) (courts cannot delay ruling on a 
motion to arbitrate based on conclusory statements that one party’s consent was deficient). 
    In support of their argument that discovery is necessary for the Court to evaluate 
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration, Plaintiffs cite a string of non-binding caselaw from 

beyond the Second Circuit.  In those cases, the rules of arbitration were so obviously lopsided 
that discovery would not have been required to demonstrate that the arbitration agreement was 
unconscionable.  See Ciago, 295 F. Supp. 2d at 329–30.  The first in this line of cases is Hooters 
of Am., Inc. v. Phillips, 173 F.3d 933 (4th Cir. 1999), in which Hooters “promulgat[ed] so many 
biased rules” — including rules enabling it to dictate the membership of the arbitral panel — that 
arbitration became “a sham system unworthy even of the name of arbitration.”  Id. at 940; see 
also Beletsis v. Credit Suisse First Bos., Corp., 2002 WL 2031610, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 
2002) (“an overabundance of invalid provisions can void an entire agreement” (citing Hooters, 
173 F.3d at 940)).  The Fourth Circuit itself, however, limited Hooters to the facts of that case, 
where one party bore the sole responsibility of setting the arbitration rules and so baldly 

manipulated the rules in its favor that it “completely failed in performing its contractual duty” to 
provide a fair arbitration forum.  Hooters, 173 F.3d at 940.              
    The Sixth Circuit decisions that Plaintiffs cite similarly declined to grant an employer’s 
motion to compel arbitration because the arbitration rules were so skewed that they were void.  
In both cases, which involved employee arbitration agreements with Ryan’s Family Steak 
Houses, Inc., the Sixth Circuit invalidated an arbitration agreement in which the employer had 
complete control over the arbitration rules, to the point that it could unilaterally alter the 
arbitration rules and appoint its own employees to arbitrate the claim.  See Floss v. Ryan’s Fam. 
Steak Houses, 211 F.3d 306, 313 n.7, 315–16 (6th Cir. 2000); Walker v. Ryan’s Fam. Steak 

Houses, 400 F.3d 370, 378, 386 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Floss, 211 F.3d at 314).  In McMullen v. 
Meijer, 355 F.3d 485 (6th Cir. 2004), the Sixth Circuit similarly found that the parties’ 
arbitration agreement did not allow an employee to effectively vindicate her claims.  In that case, 
the arbitration agreement gave the employer “unilateral control over the pool of potential 
arbitrators;” the Court voided that portion of the agreement.  Id. at 492 (citing Floss, 211 F.3d at 

310; Hooters, 173 F.3d at 938); see also id. at 491 (holding that failure to provide an arbitral 
forum in which a claim may be effectively vindicated voids the agreement as a matter of contract 
law).                                                                     
    Without the type of clear substantive or procedural bias baked into the arbitration 
agreement that was present in the Hooters line of cases, courts “decline to indulge the 
presumption that the parties and arbitral body conducting a proceeding will be unable or 
unwilling to retain competent, conscientious, and impartial arbitrators.”  Gilmer v. 
Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 30 (1991) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. 
Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 634 (1985)).  Moreover, the Federal Arbitration 
Act (FAA) already contemplates a route through which parties can seek judicial protection 

against arbitrator bias; courts can “overturn arbitration decisions ‘where there was evident 
partiality or corruption in the arbitrators.’”  Id. at 31 (quoting 9 U.S.C. § 10(b)); see also id. at 21 
(noting that fair arbitration rules “protect against biased panels”); Cole v. Burns Int’l Sec. Servs., 
105 F.3d 1465, 1482 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (same).  Plaintiffs may well be able to argue that the 
proposed arbitrator is so biased against them that the motion to compel arbitration should not be 
granted, but they do not need discovery to do so.                         
    Plaintiffs also seek to compel the NFL to produce any “contract[s] . . . containing … 
dispute resolution terms,” Mot. for Discovery, Dkt. 54 at 2, presumably so that they can 
determine whether the arbitration rules demonstrate the type of bias present in the Hooters line 

of cases; Plaintiffs should know whether they entered into any such agreements.  Plaintiffs’ 
remaining discovery requests relating to arbitrator bias, including their request for documents 
regarding Mr. Goodell’s history of arbitration decisions and his relationship with the NFL, do not 
bear on the issue of whether the arbitration agreement is contractually valid.   
    Plaintiffs do not cite a single case in which the court ordered discovery focused on the 
dealings and rulings of an individual arbitrator in the context of a motion to compel arbitration.2  

Instead, the cases upon which Plaintiffs rely concern challenges to arbitration decisions.  See, 
e.g., Nat’l Hockey League Players’ Assoc. v. Bettman, 1994 WL 38130, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 
1994) (affording plaintiffs the opportunity for discovery regarding arbitral bias on a motion for 
summary judgment after arbitration had concluded); Applied Indus. Materials Corp. v. Ovalar 
Makine Ticaret Ve Sanayi, A.S., 492 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 2007) (discussing impact of 
arbitrators’ failure to disclose conflicts of interest on a motion to set aside an arbitration award); 
Metro. Delivery Corp. v. Teamsters Loc. Union 769, 2019 WL 3752245, at *1 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 8, 
2019) (permitting discovery regarding bias in a motion to set aside an arbitration award).  The 
parties in those cases all sought relief under the FAA’s failsafe provision that allows courts to set 

aside arbitration awards rendered by biased arbitrators; they do not support Plaintiffs’ claim that 
they are entitled to discovery in order to establish that they can avoid arbitration altogether 
because they fear the arbitrator is biased.                               
    Plaintiff’s final ground for seeking discovery — the fact that the NFL was not a direct 
party to the arbitration agreement — does not go to whether Plaintiffs’ “intend[ed] to be bound 
by the arbitration agreement.”  Morton, 2016 WL 616343, at *4.  While Plaintiffs correctly note 
that they must have actually consented to release their right to adjudicate claims against the NFL 


2    The parties appeared to have exchanged discovery regarding the arbitrator’s prior rulings at the trial court 
level in McMullen v. Meijer, Inc., No. 2:99-cv-71206 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 26, 2004).  See id. Dkt. 12 at 12-13.  
Notably, the Sixth Circuit did not rely on that evidence in either of its opinions in the case.  See McMullen v. Meijer, 
Inc., 355 F.3d 485 (6th Cir. 2004); McMullen v. Meijer, Inc., 166 F. App’x 164 (6th Cir. 2006). 
in court, Mot. for Discovery, Dkt. 54 at 5, they do not dispute that their agreement to arbitrate 
covered all disputes falling within the scope of their arbitration agreement, whether that may also 
include claims against the NFL.  Plaintiffs argue that discovery is necessary because the Court 
must consider the “relationship among the parties” as one factor in determining whether the 

NFL, a non-signatory to the arbitration agreements, can enforce those agreements.  Mot. for 
Discovery, Dkt. 54 at 5 (quoting Ragone v. Atl. Video at Manhattan Ctr., 595 F.3d 115, 126–27 
(2d Cir. 2010)).  In evaluating whether the NFL may compel arbitration pursuant to arbitration 
agreements to which it is not itself a party, the Court must determine whether the NFL teams 
were, “or would predictably become, with [Plaintiffs’] knowledge and consent, affiliated or 
associated with [the NFL] in such a manner as to make it unfair to allow [Plaintiffs] to avoid 
[their] commitment to arbitrate on the ground that [the NFL] was not the very entity with which 
[Plaintiffs] had a contract.”  Sokol Holdings, Inc. v. BMB Munai, Inc., 542 F.3d 354, 361 (2d Cir. 
2008) (collecting cases).  Given the high-level nature of this inquiry, courts generally decide this 
question based on the pleadings alone.  See, e.g., Ragone v. Atl. Video at Manhattan Ctr., 2008 

WL 4058480, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2008), aff’d, 595 F.3d 115 (2d Cir. 2010).  Plaintiffs’ 
requested discovery of “[a]ll documents regarding, supporting or undermining Defendants’ 
contention that Plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate their claims with the NFL” is not required, nor 
would it be useful, for the Court to evaluate whether the NFL may appropriately compel 
Plaintiffs to arbitrate the present dispute.  Mot. for Discovery Ex. A., Dkt. 54-1 ¶3. 
                               CONCLUSION 
     For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for discovery is DENIED.  Plaintiffs’ 
response to the motion to compel arbitration must be filed no later than Friday, August 19, 
2022.  Defendants’ reply brief must be filed no later than Friday, August 26, 2022.

     Dear Judge Caproni: 
           Pursuant to Rule 5.B(i1) of Your Honor’s Individual Practices in Civil Cases, I write 
     on behalf of Defendants in the above-captioned matter to request leave to file in redacted 
     form  Exhibits  2  through  7 to  the  Declaration  of Dolores  F.  DiBella  in  Support  of 
     Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Further Proceedings (the “DiBella 
     Declaration”).  These exhibits consist of the relevant excerpts from Plaintiffs’ employment 
     agreements, which include the specific provisions—including the arbitration provisions— 
     that Defendants rely upon in their motion.  Defendants seek leave to redact the surrounding 
     provisions included in these excerpts.  We understand that Plaintiffs oppose the proposed 
     redactions, except with respect to personal contact information and information related to 
     Plaintiffs’ compensation. 
           Defendants seek to redact the provisions at issue on the ground that they are not 
     relevant to the  issues raised in their motion.  Under Second Circuit  law,  courts  have 
     “considerable  discretion  in  determining  whether  good  cause  exists  to  overcome  the 
     presumption   of   open   access”   to   documents   filed   in   the   matters   before 
     them.  Geller v. Branic Int’l Realty Corp., 212 F.3d 734, 738 (2d Cir. 2000).  Here, the 
     public interest in “monitoring the federal courts” is already satisfied because the publicly 
     filed excerpts will include all contract provisions that are relevant to the adjudication of 
     Defendants’ motion.  Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110,  119 (2d Cir. 
     2006).  Under such circumstances, it is fully within the Court’s discretion to permit the 
     other, non-relevant provisions to remain redacted.  See Torain v. Clear Channel Broad., 

FAUL,  WEILoo,  RIFARINIY,  WMAKRIUOUN  @& GOAKNRISOWN  LLI

    Inc., 651 F. Supp. 2d 125, 131 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (permitting employment agreement to 
    be filed under seal where “[a]ll of the contractual provisions relied upon by the parties. . . 
    [were] quoted in the parties’  submissions and [were] therefore incorporated in the.  .  . 
    record”). 
          As a separate and additional basis for redaction, the redacted provisions contain 
    confidential and proprietary business and employment information, which federal courts 
    have repeatedly recognized  as  a  legitimate basis  for redaction  or  sealing.   See,  e.g., 
    Hanks v. Voya  Ret.  Ins.  &  Annuity  Co.,  No.  16-cv-6399,  2020  WL 5813448,  at  *3 
    (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2020);  Oliver Wyman, Inc. v. Eielson, 282 F. Supp. 3d 684, 706-07 
    (S.D.N.Y. 2017); Avocent Redmond Corp. v. Raritan Ams., Inc., No.  10-cv-6100, 2012 
    WL 3114855, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2012).  Indeed, courts in this Circuit routinely 
    permit  parties  to  file  employment  agreements  in  redacted  form  or  under  seal.  See, 
    e.g., SEC v. Ahmed,  No.  15-cv-675,  2018  WL 4266079,  at  *3  (D.  Conn.  Sept.  6, 
    2018); Kelly v. Evolution Mkts., Inc., 626 F. Supp. 2d 364, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); Torain, 
    651 F. Supp. 2d at 131 n.2. 
          The same result should follow here.  The excerpted agreements are confidential 
    employment agreements that contain proprietary and sensitive information relating to the 
    terms  of employment between certain of the NFL’s member clubs  and their coaches, 
    including terms relating to compensation and coaching responsibilities.  Those agreements 
    are not generally available to the public or other NFL member clubs or coaches, and they 
    all  contain  broad  confidentiality  provisions  prohibiting  the  disclosure  of  their 
    terms.  See Flores-Dolphins Agreement 4 14 (Ex. 2); Flores-Patriots Agreement   12(A)— 
    (B) (Ex. 3); Flores-Steelers Agreement  7 (Ex. 4); Wilks-Cardinals Agreement   6(a) (Ex. 
    5); Wilks-Panthers Agreement J 14 (Ex. 6); Horton-Titans Agreement   3(a), (d) (Ex. 7); 
    Kelly, 626 F. Supp. 2d at 377 (permitting employment agreement that was confidential “by 
    its express terms” to be filed under seal); see also DiRussa v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 
    121 F.3d 818, 826-28 (2d Cir. 1997); Torain, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 131 n.2.  Disclosure of 
    the non-relevant terms  of these  agreements  would thus place the  member  clubs  at  a 
    competitive  disadvantage  to  rival  clubs  who  compete  for  the  same  coaching 
    candidates.  Disclosure would equally disadvantage Plaintiffs, as coaches and coaching 
    candidates, in their potential negotiations and dealings with other clubs. 
          In  addition,  some  of these  agreements—in  particular,  Plaintiff Brian  Flores’s 
    agreements with the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers and Plaintiff Steve 
    Wilks’s agreement with the Carolina Panthers—involve clubs who are not named parties 
    to  this  litigation  and  whose  privacy  interests  should  “weigh  heavily”  against 
    disclosure.  United  States  v.  Amodeo,  71  F.3d  1044,  1050  (2d  Cir.  1995)  (citation 
    omitted); see Statoil (Nigeria) Ltd. v. Nigerian Nat’l Petroleum Corp., No.  18-cv-2392, 
    2020 WL 3170566, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2020) (granting request to redact third-party 
    information); Dodona I, LLC v. Goldman,  Sachs &  Co.,  119 F.  Supp.  3d  152,  156-57 
    (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (same). 

FAUL,  WEILOS,  RIFRINIY,  WHIAKRION  &@ OAKNRISWN

            For these reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court enter an order (1) 
      granting leave for Defendants to file in redacted form Exhibits 2 through 7 to the DiBella 
      Declaration, and (ii) prohibiting Plaintiffs from publicly filing any other versions of the 
      employment agreements excerpted in those exhibits. 

                                        Respectfully submitted, 

                                        /s/ Loretta E. Lynch 
                                        Loretta E. Lynch 
      ce:    Counsel of Record (via electronic filing) 

Application GRANTED. 
The Court finds that employment and financial information unrelated to Defendants’ arbitration agreement with 
Plaintiffs have a limited bearing on whether the Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Further Proceedings 
should be granted. Accordingly, the presumption of access established by Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of 
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006)  is accorded less weight, as access to the redacted information is not 
necessary to preserve the interested public's ability to monitor judicial decisionmaking. See id. at 119 ("[T]he 
weight to be given the presumption of access must be governed by the role of the material at issue in the 
exercise of Article III judicial power and the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the federal 
courts.” /d. (alteration in original)). 
In addition, the Court finds that the privacy interests of unnamed parties included in the documents are 
substantial and weigh against the presumption of access. See id. at 120 (listing factors to be weighed against the 
presumption of access, including "the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure" (citing United States v. 
Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d. Cir. 1995)).

           Flores, et al. v.  The National Football League, et al., No. 22-cv-871-VEC 
     Dear Judge Caproni: 
           Pursuant to Rule 5.B(11) of Your Honor’s Individual Practices in Civil Cases, I write 
     on behalf of Defendants in the above-captioned matter to request leave to file in redacted 
     form  Exhibits  2  through  7 to  the  Declaration  of Dolores  F.  DiBella  in  Support  of 
     Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Further Proceedings (the “DiBella 
     Declaration”).  These exhibits consist of the relevant excerpts from Plaintiffs’ employment 
     agreements, which include the specific provisions—including the arbitration provisions— 
     that Defendants rely upon in their motion.  Defendants seek leave to redact the surrounding 
     provisions included in these excerpts.  We understand that Plaintiffs oppose the proposed 
     redactions, except with respect to personal contact information and information related to 
     Plaintiffs’ compensation. 
           Defendants seek to redact the provisions at issue on the ground that they are not 
     relevant to  the  issues raised in their motion.  Under  Second Circuit law,  courts  have 
     “considerable  discretion  in  determining  whether  good  cause  exists  to  overcome  the 
     presumption   of   open   access”   to   documents   filed   in   the   matters   before 
     them.  Geller v. Branic Int’l Realty Corp., 212 F.3d 734, 738 (2d Cir. 2000).  Here, the 
     public interest in “monitoring the federal courts” is already satisfied because the publicly 
     filed excerpts will include all contract provisions that are relevant to the adjudication of 
     Defendants’ motion.  Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110,  119 (2d Cir. 
     2006).  Under such circumstances, it is fully within the Court’s discretion to permit the 
     other, non-relevant provisions to remain redacted.  See Torain v. Clear Channel Broad., 

PAUL,  WEIOS,  RIFRINI,  WrIAKILUIN  & UAKRISOVWN  □□

     Inc., 651 F. Supp. 2d 125, 131 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (permitting employment agreement to 
     be filed under seal where “[a]ll of the contractual provisions relied upon by the parties . . . 
     [were]  quoted in the parties’  submissions and [were] therefore incorporated in the... 
     record”). 
           As a separate and additional basis for redaction, the redacted provisions contain 
     confidential and proprietary business and employment information, which federal courts 
     have repeatedly recognized  as  a  legitimate basis  for redaction  or  sealing.   See,  e.g., 
     Hanks v. Voya  Ret.  Ins.  &  Annuity  Co.,  No.  16-cv-6399,  2020  WL 5813448,  at  *3 
     (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2020);  Oliver Wyman, Inc. v. Eielson, 282 F. Supp. 3d 684, 706-07 
     (S.D.N.Y. 2017); Avocent Redmond Corp. v. Raritan Ams., Inc., No.  10-cv-6100, 2012 
     WL 3114855, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2012).  Indeed, courts in this Circuit routinely 
     permit  parties  to  file  employment  agreements  in  redacted  form  or  under  seal.  See, 
     e.g., SEC v. Ahmed,  No.  15-cv-675,  2018  WL 4266079,  at  *3  (D.  Conn.  Sept.  6, 
     2018); Kelly v. Evolution Mkts., Inc., 626 F. Supp. 2d 364, 377 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); Torain, 
     651 F. Supp. 2d at 131 n.2. 
           The same result should follow here.  The excerpted agreements are confidential 
     employment agreements that contain proprietary and sensitive information relating to the 
     terms of employment between certain of the NFL’s member clubs and their coaches, 
     including terms relating to compensation and coaching responsibilities.  Those agreements 
     are not generally available to the public or other NFL member clubs or coaches, and they 
     all  contain  broad  confidentiality  provisions  prohibiting  the  disclosure  of  their 
     terms.  See Flores-Dolphins Agreement 4 14 (Ex. 2); Flores-Patriots Agreement § 12(A)— 
     (B) (Ex. 3); Flores-Steelers Agreement §] 7 (Ex. 4); Wilks-Cardinals Agreement 4 6(a) (Ex. 
     5); Wilks-Panthers Agreement § 14 (Ex. 6); Horton-Titans Agreement § 3(a), (d) (Ex. 7); 
     Kelly, 626 F. Supp. 2d at 377 (permitting employment agreement that was confidential “by 
     its express terms” to be filed under seal); see also DiRussa v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 
     121 F.3d 818, 826-28 (2d Cir. 1997); Torain, 651 F. Supp. 2d at 131 n.2.  Disclosure of 
     the non-relevant terms  of these  agreements would thus place the  member  clubs  at  a 
     competitive  disadvantage  to  rival  clubs  who  compete  for  the  same  coaching 
     candidates.  Disclosure would equally disadvantage Plaintiffs, as coaches and coaching 
     candidates, in their potential negotiations and dealings with other clubs. 
           In  addition,  some  of these  agreements—in particular,  Plaintiff Brian  Flores’s 
     agreements with the New England Patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers and Plaintiff Steve 
     Wilks’s agreement with the Carolina Panthers—involve clubs who are not named parties 
     to  this  litigation  and  whose  privacy  interests  should  “weigh  heavily”  against 
     disclosure.  United  States  v.  Amodeo,  71  F.3d  1044,  1050  (2d  Cir.  1995)  (citation 
     omitted); see Statoil (Nigeria) Ltd. v. Nigerian Nat’l Petroleum Corp., No.  18-cv-2392, 
     2020 WL 3170566, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2020) (granting request to redact third-party 
     information); Dodona I,  LLC v. Goldman,  Sachs &  Co.,  119 F.  Supp.  3d  152,  156-57 
     (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (same). 

PAUL,  WEIOS,  RIFRINI,  WrIAKILUIN  & UAKRISOVWN  □□

           For these reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court enter an order (1) 
     granting leave for Defendants to file in redacted form Exhibits 2 through 7 to the DiBella 
     Declaration, and (i1) prohibiting Plaintiffs from publicly filing any other versions of the 
     employment agreements excerpted in those exhibits. 

                                       Respectfully submitted, 

                                       /s/ Loretta E. Lynch

     ce:    Counsel of Record (via electronic filing) 

Plaintiffs must respond not later than Monday, 
June 27, 2022 why Defendants should not be 
permitted to file Exhibits 2 through 7 under seal. 
 SO ORDERED.
