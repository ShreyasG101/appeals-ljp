reason_for_appeal: '=== Ramón González-Beiró, Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture; Alex Muñiz-Lasalle, Deputy Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in holding that Article XII(B) of Market Regulation No. 8 is expressly preempted by the PPIA, contending that the court adopted too broad an understanding of the term ''operations'' in the PPIA''s preemption clause.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court misapplied the PPIA''s savings clause by concluding that Article XII(B) is not exempted from preemption.

  3. Appellants argued that, in statutory context and under the PPIA''s regulatory scheme, ''operations'' as used in the preemption clause should be limited to slaughtering and processing activities, and that Article XII(B) does not pertain to those activities.

  4. Appellants asserted that Article XII(B) has no direct effect on the operations of NWS and only has an incidental effect, unlike the state law at issue in National Meat Association.

  5. Appellants argued that the term ''operations'' in the PPIA''s preemption clause is limited by the accompanying terms ''premises'' and ''facilities,'' such that only requirements concerning onsite operations can be preempted, and that Article XII(B) does not have the requisite onsite impact.

  6. Appellants contended that Article XII(B) is analogous to the delivery truck inspection ordinance in Chicago-Midwest Meat Association, which was not preempted, and therefore Article XII(B) should not be preempted.'
