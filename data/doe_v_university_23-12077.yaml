  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in finding that his First Amendment rights were not violated by the University''s disciplinary action, contending that his conduct did not cause or reasonably forecast a substantial disruption or invade the rights of others under the Tinker standard.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in holding that the Individual Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to his request for money damages, asserting that the right of university students to engage in offensive expression on a public university campus was clearly established.'
