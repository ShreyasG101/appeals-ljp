outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Elizabeth F. Warner''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her age discrimination claims under the ADEA by applying the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework instead of the more lenient standard set forth in Babb v. Wilkie, which only requires a showing that age discrimination played any part in the decision.

  2. Appellant contended that, even under the McDonnell Douglas framework, there were genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the USPS''s stated reasons for denying her the Durham and Somersworth promotions were pretextual and that the true reason was unlawful age discrimination.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her sex discrimination claims under Title VII by failing to recognize that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the USPS''s stated reasons for denying her the promotions were a pretext for sex discrimination.

  4. Appellant claimed that the district court overlooked evidence of pretext and discriminatory motive, including demographic data about Hayes''s promotion history, Hayes''s comments during the Somersworth interview about the office never having had a female postmaster and questioning how that would work, Hayes''s reference to a group of young male employees as ''smoking hot,'' and evidence that Warner was better qualified than the selected candidates.

  5. Appellant asserted that inconsistencies and gaps in Hayes''s statements and testimony, as well as missing interview notes, created genuine disputes of material fact regarding the credibility of the USPS''s proffered reasons for the promotion decisions.'
