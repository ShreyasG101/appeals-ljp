outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Mary Doe''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in denying her motion to be appointed ''next friend'' to a class of viable fetuses to bring a constitutional challenge to the Reproductive Health Act (RHA) on their behalf, specifically contending that the court incorrectly required her to demonstrate a ''significant relationship'' to the fetuses, which she maintained is not a prerequisite under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c).

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in denying her post-judgment motion to file an amended complaint, disputing the court''s finding that amendment would be futile for lack of standing, and arguing that the proposed amended complaint asserted claims on behalf of a viable fetus, ''Baby Nicholas,'' who had been cognizably harmed by the RHA.

  3. Appellant further argued that the district court should have set aside the judgment under Rules 59(e) and 60(b) because the Supreme Court''s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization constituted an intervening change in controlling law or otherwise extraordinary circumstance justifying post-judgment relief, and that she had not received an opportunity to amend her original complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15.'
