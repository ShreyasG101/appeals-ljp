                            IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS



 MATTHEW BYRNES,

                                Plaintiff,                  Case No. 21-2086-DDC

 v.

 ST. CATHERINE HOSPITAL, et al.,

                                Defendants.



                                MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

       People get fired from their jobs for many reasons, or, sometimes, for no reason at all.

And if the person’s an at-will employee, that’s just fine, the law says. Just fine, that is, as long as

his employer didn’t fire him for discriminatory or retaliatory reasons. Plaintiff Dr. Matthew

Byrnes got fired in February 2020. He had worked as a surgeon and intensivist for St. Catherine

Hospital (SCH) in Garden City, Kansas, since 2012. And he was their Chief Medical Officer

(CMO) from 2013 to 2019. Then, SCH and Centura—who managed SCH—fired him without

cause. Plaintiff was an at-will employee under his employment agreement. So, SCH and

Centura didn’t need a reason to fire him. And the court isn’t here to decide if firing him was a

good call—justified or unjustified, fair or not. They didn’t need a reason at all, much less a good

or fair one. Instead, the outcome of defendants’ summary judgment motion (Doc. 172) turns

solely on whether Centura fired plaintiff for discriminatory or retaliatory reasons.

       Plaintiff claims they did. He contends that defendants St. Catherine Hospital and Centura

Health Corporation wanted him out because of his complaints about a fellow doctor. Plaintiff

had accused Dr. Kurt Kessler of sexual harassment and other standard-of-care shortcomings. He
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 2 of 55




also claims that—because of these complaints against Dr. Kessler—defendants viewed him as

mentally unstable. So, he asserts, this perceived impairment drove their desire to let him go.

What’s more, even after they got rid of him, plaintiff claims that defendants continued to

retaliate against him by unfairly reporting four of his medical cases to the Kansas Board of

Healing Arts (KBHA).

       Defendants, for their part, say they didn’t fire plaintiff for retaliatory or discriminatory

reasons. Instead, they rely on patient care concerns and issues with peer review in his role as

CMO. And they say they never perceived plaintiff as impaired, nor was their KBHA reporting

process retaliatory.

       And so, defendants have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 172). The court

grants the motion, concluding that plaintiff has failed to present a triable issue on his federal

claims of Title VII retaliation, ADA retaliation, or ADA discrimination. In a nutshell, plaintiff

has failed to adduce evidence that defendants’ reasons for terminating his employment were

pretext for retaliation. Nor has he shown facts sufficient to support an inference that defendants

perceived him as impaired. And he fails to demonstrate—such that a reasonable juror could

infer—a causal connection between defendants’ KBHA reporting processes and his protected

activity. With the federal claims resolved, the court declines to exercise supplemental

jurisdiction over plaintiff’s state law claims and thus dismisses those state law claims without

prejudice. The court explains its decisions, below.

I.     Background

       The following facts are stipulated, uncontroverted or, where controverted, are stated in

the light most favorable to plaintiff, the party opposing summary judgment. Scott v. Harris, 550

U.S. 372, 378 (2007).

                                          Plaintiff’s Job

        Plaintiff worked at Saint Catherine Hospital in Garden City, Kansas, as a general surgeon

and intensivist from 2012 until February 12, 2020. Doc. 165 at 2–3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.ii., vi.,

xii.). Plaintiff also served as SCH’s Chief Medical Officer from roughly 2013 to June 2019. Id.

at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xi.). The agreements that governed plaintiff’s employment during his

tenure at SCH specified that SCH was “operated and managed by Centura . . . , which may

assign management duties to its Centura Health Physician Group division.” Id. (Pretrial Order

¶ 2.a.ix.); Doc. 174-7 at 1 (Def. Ex. 24). And so, SCH and Centura “concede that they jointly

employed” plaintiff. Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.x.).

                                        April 2019 Meeting

        The issues with plaintiff’s employment started—at least for purposes of this case—in

April 2019. It was then that five SCH doctors, who worked with plaintiff, requested that SCH’s

Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Scott Taylor fire plaintiff. Doc. 173-2 at 5 (Taylor Dep. 133:23–

135:21); Doc. 173-13 at 4 (Arroyo Dep. 31:24–32:5). The doctors attending that meeting

included Dr. William Freund, Dr. Kessler, Dr. Julie Freeman (King),1 Dr. Gretchen Dunford, and

Dr. Zeferino Arroyo. Doc. 173-2 at 5 (Taylor Dep. 134:8–12). At the meeting, the doctors

expressed various concerns about plaintiff, including one about patient care, and requested that

he no longer work at SCH. Id. (Taylor Dep. 133:23–135:21). CEO Taylor decided to remove

plaintiff as CMO, but leave his employment intact. Id. (Taylor Dep. 135:2–21). And so,

plaintiff ceased performing the duties of CMO, but he continued working at SCH. Doc. 165 at 3

(Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xiii., vi.).

                                  Plaintiff’s Sexual Harassment Complaints

        A few months later, on August 31, 2019, plaintiff submitted a written complaint to Dr.

Freund and Nancy Killion, Centura’s Director of Quality, about Dr. Kessler. Doc. 165 at 3

(Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xv.). Plaintiff submitted the complaint by email at 1:54 AM on a Saturday

morning. Doc. 174-16 at 1 (Def. Ex. 33). In the complaint, plaintiff alleged, among other

things, that: Dr. Kessler’s conversion rate from a laparoscopic approach to an open procedure

for gallbladder removal was “massively higher” than the appropriate conversion rate; the nursing

staff “is nearly uniformly concerned with his ability to care for patients in the ICU[;]” Dr.

Kessler “rarely wears gloves when doing sensitive exams[;]” and Dr. Kessler “made sexually

explicit comments to numerous nurses[,]” “inappropriately touched nurses[,]” and “voiced out

loud in the operating room area that he rarely spends time at home because he is either at the

hospital or the strip club.” Id. at 2–3 (Def. Ex. 33).

        Dr. Freund, in his capacity as Medical Staff President, investigated the allegations in the

complaint, Doc. 174-1 at 4 (Freund Dep. 35:1–7). But plaintiff contends that his investigation

was neither fair nor reasonable, in part, because Dr. Freund let Dr. Kessler read the complaint,

told him that plaintiff had filed it, and said he needed Dr. Kessler’s response. Doc. 183 at 4;

Doc. 183-15 at 6–7 (Kessler Dep. 27:21–28:11). And Dr. Freund shared plaintiff’s complaint

about Dr. Kessler and that he had evaluated those concerns with SCH’s Medical Executive

Committee (MEC) on September 17, 2019.2 Doc. 174-1 at 8–9 (Freund Dep. 58:24–61:10).

Based on the MEC meeting discussion, one of the doctors in attendance—Dr. Dunford, Chief of

Surgery—contacted Ms. Killion with concerns about plaintiff. Doc. 173-11 at 3–4 (Dunford



2
         The parties dispute the extent Dr. Freund shared accurately or specifically about his investigation
into this complaint. Doc. 183 at 5. The parties also dispute Dr. Freund concluding that the allegations in
the complaint were false and his representing that conclusion to the MEC. Id.

                                                         4
         Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 5 of 55




Dep. 31:20–35:1). Dr. Dunford expressed that she thought plaintiff “seemed to be very

disturbed, writing a letter like that about a colleague.” Id. at 4 (Dunford Dep. 34:24–35:1). Dr.

Dunford then emailed Dr. Toni Green-Cheatwood—Centura’s Group VP and Physician

Executive for Centura’s Greater Colorado Kansas (GCK) Group—with the same concerns. Id. at

4 (Dunford Dep. 35:21–36:2).

        In response to these emails, Dr. Freund, Dr. Green-Cheatwood, and Dr. Bryan Stucky—

Vice-President of Medical Staff—met with plaintiff on October 16, 2019. Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial

Order ¶ 2.a.xvi.). At the meeting, plaintiff challenged the adequacy of any investigation of his

allegations against Dr. Kessler and reiterated his complaints. Doc. 183-6 at 49–50, 52 (Byrnes

Dep. 180:5–181:9, 183:5-24).

                                 MEC Request for Psychological Evaluation

        The MEC continued to express concerns about plaintiff’s allegations against Dr. Kessler,

according to a letter Dr. Freund delivered to plaintiff on December 29, 2019. Doc. 174-1 at 16

(Freund Dep. 112:1–13). The letter referenced the MEC’s concerns—apparently expressed at a

November 2019 meeting—about plaintiff’s allegations and about his “insistence that [he] believe

these allegations to be true.” Doc. 174-23 (Def. Ex. 40). In light of these discussions and

concerns, the letter requested that plaintiff undergo a psychological evaluation, stating that the

MEC “unanimously agreed that it was in the best interest of the hospital and the medical staff to

ask [plaintiff] to seek an evaluation including a psychologic assessment.”3 Id. Dr. Freund alone

signed the letter. Id.


3
          Plaintiff disputes the letter’s statement that the MEC unanimously agreed to this evaluation
request. While the letter makes this assertion, plaintiff cites deposition testimony from Dr. Stucky stating
that the letter itself was drafted after the November meeting and thus the MEC couldn’t have voted on the
letter itself. Doc. 183-19 at 35 (Stucky Dep. 83:1–19). And Dr. Stucky couldn’t remember if there was a
vote about this request, or whether the vote was unanimous. Id.


                                                         5
         Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 6 of 55




        On January 19, 2020, plaintiff responded to this request with a letter of his own, emailed

to Dr. Stucky, who had replaced Dr. Freund as President of the Medical Staff.4 Doc. 165 at 3

(Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xvii.). Plaintiff’s response letter asserted that “Dr. Freund’s letter is

tantamount to retaliation against a whistleblower[,]” reiterated his initial complaints about Dr.

Kessler, and demanded the MEC retract Dr. Freund’s letter. Doc. 174-24 at 2–6 (Def. Ex. 41).

On January 21, 2020, Dr. Stucky emailed plaintiff a letter notifying him that the MEC would

retract the letter requesting his psychological evaluation. Doc. 174-25 at 1–2 (Def. Ex. 42).

                           Kansas Board Healing Arts Complaint and Subpoena

        Less than a week later, SCH received a subpoena from the Kansas Board of Healing Arts

(KBHA). Doc. 165 at 4 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xviii.). The subpoena demanded SCH produce

records, reports, proceedings, findings, and documents about plaintiff pursuant to an anonymous

complaint filed against him. Doc. 174-27 (Def. Ex. 44). Plaintiff later provided Centura’s in-

house General Counsel, Peter Sabey, with a copy of the anonymous complaint. Doc. 165 at 4

(Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xix.). The KBHA complaint against plaintiff summarized ten different

allegations. Doc. 174-31 at 6 (Def. Ex. 48). These included:

               “multiple alarming adverse outcomes, including multiple patient deaths[;]”

               “pressuring hospital CEO Scott Taylor to disband the hospital peer review

                committee[;]”

               “an unusually high number of nicked bowels during surgeries[;]”

               “abandon[ing] 8 I.C.U. cases[;]”



4
          The Pretrial Order provides that plaintiff sent this letter to Dr. Stucky on January 19, 2019. Doc.
165 at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xvii.). Given the chronology of events, the court assumes the year identified
in this stipulation is erroneous and assumes the proper date is January 19, 2020. The date on the letter
itself—and the email that transported it—confirms this assumption. See Doc. 174-24 at 1–2 (Def. Ex.
41).

                                                          6
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 7 of 55




              “transferring out patients that he has dangerously mismanaged[;]” and

              “well known incidents of sexual relations in hospital treatment rooms with

               nurses.”

Id. The KBHA complaint also described a vote of no confidence from plaintiff’s fellow

physicians: “[T]he medical staff has advised the CEO that he is unsafe and needs an assessment

due to his erratic behaviors and dangerous violations of the standard of care.” Id.

       On January 30, 2020, plaintiff phoned Dr. Green-Cheatwood to discuss the anonymous

KBHA complaint. Doc. 183-24 at 3 (Byrnes Decl. ¶ 11). He told Dr. Green-Cheatwood “that

the report was made in retaliation for the complaint [plaintiff] had filed against Dr. Kessler in

August.” Id. And, he asserted, the report’s allegations were false. Id. He then cited specific

data showing his mortality rate, recited his work experience as a surgeon, and reviewed his

litigation record (just two unsuccessful lawsuits against him in 12.5 years in practice). Id.; Doc.

174-29 at 1 (Def. Ex. 46). He also informed Dr. Green-Cheatwood about “many witnesses who

had the best knowledge to speak to and refute the allegations in the KBHA complaint[.]” Doc.

183-24 at 3 (Byrnes Decl. ¶ 12).

                                     Investigating KBHA Complaint

       That same day, Dr. Green-Cheatwood informed in-house counsel Mr. Sabey about her

phone call with plaintiff. Doc. 174-29 at 1 (Def. Ex. 46). In response, Mr. Sabey initiated an

internal investigation, with plans to interview SCH “employees and medical staff members” and

gather “documents and information related to [KBHA’s] inquiry.” Doc. 174-30 at 1 (Def. Ex.

47).

       Mr. Sabey, Dr. Green-Cheatwood, and Morgan Thomas (GCK Group Quality Director)

traveled on February 6, 2020, to Garden City to conduct investigative interviews and gather



                                                     7
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 8 of 55




documents. Id.; Doc. 165 at 4 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xx.). While there, Mr. Sabey and Dr. Green-

Cheatwood talked to CEO Taylor, Ms. Killion, Dr. Michael Babigumira, Dr. Arroyo, Dr.

Freeman (King), Dr. Dunford, Dr. Stucky, Dr. Freund, Dr. Kessler, and Dr. James Zauche. Doc.

165 at 4 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xx.). Mr. Sabey and Dr. Green-Cheatwood also inquired about any

further developments and gathered documents about plaintiff’s allegations against Dr. Kessler.

Doc. 183-11 at 48–49 (Freund Dep. 168:24–169:16); Doc. 183-13 at 29–30 (Green-Cheatwood

Dep. 92:21–93:21). Mr. Sabey and Dr. Green-Cheatwood didn’t interview plaintiff as part of

their investigation. Doc. 165 at 4 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xx.). Nor did they interview any nurses.

Id.

                                             Firing Plaintiff

       Having completed their investigation, Mr. Sabey and Dr. Green-Cheatwood reported

their interpretation of its results to Tom Gessel, GCK Group President, and Scott Lichtenberger,

President of Centura Health Physician Group by phone on February 10, 2020. Doc. 173-9 at 22

(Green-Cheatwood Dep. 157:24–160:23); Doc. 173-5 at 21 (Sabey Dep. 145:13–146:1; 146:20–

148:17). During that phone call, Dr. Green-Cheatwood recommended that they fire plaintiff.

Doc. 173-9 at 22 (Green-Cheatwood Dep. 158:13–24). After the call, Mr. Gessel and Dr.

Lichtenberger jointly decided to terminate plaintiff’s employment. Doc. 173-3 at 3

(Lichtenberger Dep. 24:8–24). According to Dr. Lichtenberger, he decided based on the

information provided to him by Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey. Id. at 4 (Lichtenberger

Dep. 25:8–27:16; 28:14–18). And so, on February 12, 2020, Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Dr.

Zauche met with plaintiff, told him that he was fired, and provided him a termination letter

signed by Dr. Lichtenberger. Doc. 165 at 4 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xxi.). The termination letter

specified that plaintiff’s employment was terminated “without cause.” Doc. 174-45 at 1 (Def.

Ex. 51). Plaintiff’s then-in-force employment agreement permitted either party to “terminate
                                                    8
           Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 9 of 55




[the] Agreement for any reason or no reason” on 90 days written notice. Doc. 174-7 at 5 (Def.

Ex. 24).

                               Peer Review & Report of Cases to KBHA

       Several months after plaintiff’s termination, SCH submitted a Report of Adverse

Findings on one of the plaintiff’s cases to KBHA. Doc. 173-18 at 3 (Evans Dep. 19:11–20:4).

This report process began, on February 18, 2020, when Dr. Green-Cheatwood sent Mr. Gessel

and Dr. Lichtenberger, among others, a proposed plan for establishing quality and peer review at

SCH. Doc. 174-54 at 1–2 (Def. Ex. 60); Doc. 173-15 at 9–10 (Thomas Dep. 111:21–114:1).

The proposed plan involved immediately sending out SCH cases to other facilities boasting high

functioning peer review committees so that those committees could review and identify any

immediate care concerns. Doc. 173-15 at 9–10 (Thomas Dep. 112:19–113:3). So, in May 2020,

Dr. Stucky—on behalf of SCH MEC— began identifying which cases to submit for this outside

review. Doc. 173-7 at 5 (Stucky Dep. 27:10–28:24). Dr. Stucky also relied—specifically in

surgical cases—on recommendations from Dr. Green-Cheatwood. Id. With the cases identified,

peer review committees at other Centura facilities—including one from St. Anthony’s Hospital

directed by Dr. Rebecca Vogel—reviewed them. Doc. 173-15 at 32 (Thomas Dep. 241:20–

242:16); Doc. 173-17 at 2 (Vogel Dep. 46:3–24). When a case received a score from the peer

review committee that met a mandatory reporting threshold, SCH submitted a Report of Adverse

Findings to KBHA. Doc. 173-15 at 32 (Thomas Dep. 241:20–242:16). As mentioned above,

SCH submitted one of plaintiff’s cases around September 28, 2020. Doc. 173-18 at 3 (Evans

Dep. 19:11–20:4); Doc. 184-11 (Pl. Ex. E34). Later, on January 12, 2021, it submitted three

more reports about plaintiff’s cases. Id. at 3–4 (Evans Dep. 20:18–21:3).

                                           KBHA Conclusions

       In the end, KBHA dismissed all four Adverse Findings Reports (and the anonymous

complaint against plaintiff) in this fashion: First, KBHA gave plaintiff an opportunity to respond

to the allegations asserted in the anonymous complaint against him. Doc. 183-24 at 2 (Byrnes

Decl. ¶ 10). And on September 22, 2021, KBHA sent plaintiff a letter stating they had

determined not to take any action at this time and closed the case. Id. After receiving the first

SCH Adverse Findings Report, KBHA notified plaintiff and again gave him an opportunity to

respond. Id. at 4 (Byrnes Decl. ¶ 17). KBHA also decided not to take action on that report and

closed the case. Id. Finally, KBHA notified plaintiff and gave him an opportunity to respond to

the final three cases SCH had submitted. Id. (Byrnes Decl. ¶ 20). And plaintiff received a final

letter from KBHA on August 3, 2022. It asserted that “the reviewing Committee determined that

the treatment [he] provided adhered to the applicable standard of care” and KBHA closed the

matter. Id.

       That’s all for now. This Order will provide a few additional facts that correspond to the

specific arguments raised in the parties’ written submissions.

II.    Summary Judgment Standard

       Summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party demonstrates there is “no

genuine dispute” about “any material fact” and that the movant is “entitled to a judgment as a

matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). This standard dictates that the court “view the evidence

and make inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant.” Nahno-Lopez v. Houser,

625 F.3d 1279, 1283 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing Oldenkamp v. United Am. Ins. Co., 619 F.3d 1243,

1245–46 (10th Cir. 2010)).

       “An issue of fact is ‘genuine’ ‘if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a

verdict for the non-moving party’ on the issue.” Id. (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,

                                                    10
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 11 of 55




477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). “An issue of fact is ‘material’ ‘if under the substantive law it is

essential to the proper disposition of the claim’ or defense.” Id. (quoting Adler v. Wal-Mart

Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 670 (10th Cir. 1998)).

       The moving party bears “‘both the initial burden of production on a motion for summary

judgment and the burden of establishing that summary judgment is appropriate as a matter of

law.’” Kannady v. City of Kiowa, 590 F.3d 1161, 1169 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting Trainor v.

Apollo Metal Specialties, Inc., 318 F.3d 976, 979 (10th Cir. 2002)). To carry this burden, the

moving party “‘need not negate the non-movant’s claim, but need only point to an absence of

evidence to support the non-movant’s claim.’” Id. (quoting Sigmon v. CommunityCare HMO,

Inc., 234 F.3d 1121, 1125 (10th Cir. 2000)). Even if the non-moving party fails to respond

adequately, “the district court may not grant the motion without first examining the moving

party’s submission to determine if it has met its initial burden of demonstrating that no material

issues of fact remain for trial and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”

Reed v. Bennett, 312 F.3d 1190, 1194–95 (10th Cir. 2002).

       If the moving party satisfies its initial burden, the non-moving party “‘may not rest on its

pleadings, but must bring forward specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial [on] those

dispositive matters for which it carries the burden of proof.’” Kannady, 590 F.3d at 1169

(quoting Jenkins v. Wood, 81 F.3d 988, 990 (10th Cir. 1996)); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,

477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986); Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248–49. The specific “facts must be identified

(quotation cleaned up).

       Finally, since 1986, federal courts haven’t viewed summary judgment as a “disfavored

procedural shortcut.” Celotex, 477 U.S. at 327. Instead, it represents an important procedure

“designed ‘to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.’” Id.

(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1).

III.   McDonnell Douglas Burden-Shifting Framework

       According to the Pretrial Order, plaintiff asserts seven claims: Title VII Retaliation

(Count 1); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 65-4928 (Count 2); ADA (Count 3); Fraud (Count 4); Fraud by

Silence (Count 5); Promissory Estoppel/Detrimental Reliance (Count 7); and Common Law

Retaliation under the Kansas Wage Payment Act (Count 10). Doc. 165 at 17–18 (Pretrial Order

¶ 4.a.i.–vii.). Three of these claims arise under federal law, and this Order will focus on those

first: (1) Title VII retaliation, (2) ADA discrimination, and (3) ADA retaliation. The familiar

McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework for Title VII claims applies to all three federal

law claims. See Doebele v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 342 F.3d 1117, 1135 (10th Cir. 2003)

(explaining framework applies to Title VII and applying framework to ADA retaliation claim);

Morgan v. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir. 1997) (applying framework to ADA

disability discrimination claim). And so, the court identifies that framework before beginning its

analysis of plaintiff’s federal claims.

       Under the familiar burden-shifting framework, plaintiff first must present a prima facie

case of discrimination or retaliation. Bekkem v. Wilkie, 915 F.3d 1258, 1267 (10th Cir. 2019).

But the “burden on the employee to establish a prima facie case is light[.]” Guy v. McDonough,

No. 20-6158, 2021 WL 3854764, at *2 (10th Cir. Aug. 30, 2021). Then, the burden of

production shifts to the employer “to offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory [and nonretaliatory]
                                                    12
         Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 13 of 55




reason for its employment decision.” Morgan, 108 F.3d at 1323. As with the employee’s burden

in the first step, the employer’s burden at this second stage is “exceedingly light.” Montes v. Vail

Clinic, Inc., 497 F.3d 1160, 1173 (10th Cir. 2007). If the employer offers a legitimate reason,

“the burden then reverts to the plaintiff to show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact . .

. whether the employer’s proffered reason for the challenged action is pretextual—i.e., unworthy

of belief.” Morgan, 108 F.3d at 1323 (quotation cleaned up).

         The court applies this McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework to plaintiff’s

federal law claims, starting with his two Title VII retaliation claims.

IV.      Title VII Claims (Count I)

         Plaintiff asserts two retaliation claims based on Title VII. First, plaintiff asserts that

defendants fired him as retaliation for his complaints about Dr. Kessler’s alleged sexual

harassment,5 thus violating Title VII. Doc. 165 at 17 (Pretrial Order ¶ 4.a.i.). Second, plaintiff

contends, defendants engaged in a biased and unfair review process of his cases, leading to

reporting four of his cases to KBHA, in retaliation for those same complaints about sexual

harassment and for his filing of EEOC charges. Doc. 165 at 10 (Pretrial Order ¶ 3.a.). Together,

these claims comprise Count I. The court starts with plaintiff’s termination-based retaliation

claim.

         A.      Title VII Termination-Based Retaliation Claim


5
        Plaintiff also asserts that defendants fired him in retaliation for filing EEOC charges. Doc. 165 at
17–18 (Pretrial Order ¶ 4.a.iii.). The court addresses the timing of the EEOC charge filing later in this
Order. See § V.B. There, the court determines that plaintiff’s firing occurred before plaintiff filed any
EEOC charges. Id. And so, the court doesn’t address the filing of EEOC charges as part of plaintiff’s
protected activity under its Title VII retaliation claim premised on his firing. An employer can’t fire an
employee in retaliation for behavior after he was fired. See Durkin v. City of Chicago, 341 F.3d 606,
614–15 (7th Cir. 2003) (“It is axiomatic that a plaintiff engage in statutorily protected activity before an
employer can retaliate against her for engaging in statutorily protected activity.”).

                1.      Prima Facie Case

        Title VII makes certain forms of retaliation unlawful by providing that an employer may

not “discriminate against any of his employees . . . because [the employee] has opposed any

practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII].” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). A

plaintiff asserting a Title VII retaliation claim without direct evidence of retaliation must

establish a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas. Bekkem, 915 F.3d at 1267. For Title VII

retaliation, this prima facie case has three elements. A plaintiff must show “(1) that [he] engaged

in protected opposition to discrimination, (2) that a reasonable employee would have found the

challenged action materially adverse, and (3) that a causal connection existed between the

protected activity and the materially adverse action.” Id. (quoting Khalik v. United Air Lines,

671 F.3d 1188, 1193 (10th Cir. 2012)). The burden rests on plaintiff to establish a triable issue

for all three prima facie elements. Id.

        Here, neither party disputes that plaintiff engaged in protected opposition to

discrimination.6 And the parties also stipulate that plaintiff submitted a written complaint about

Dr. Kessler’s alleged sexual harassment on August 31, 2019. Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial Order

¶ 2.a.xv.). “Complaints of retaliation for having complained of sexual harassment are, like the

complaints of sexual harassment themselves, protected activity under Title VII.” Townsend v.

BG-Meridian, Inc., No. CIV-04-1162-F, 2005 WL 2978899, at *5 (W.D. Okla. Nov. 7, 2005).

That takes care of the first prong.




6
        Indeed, defendants “assume for purposes of summary judgment only, and without admitting the
same, that Plaintiff participated in protected activity pursuant to Title VII when he complained in August
2019 that nurses were sexually harassed by Dr. Kessler and when he filed charges of discrimination with
EEOC.” Doc. 173 at 26 n.7.


                                                        14
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 15 of 55




        The second prima facie prong is equally straightforward. Plaintiff asserts his firing

provides the requisite materially adverse action. Doc. 183 at 36. And defendants don’t

challenge that assertion.7 See generally Doc. 173. Nor could they. The parties stipulate that Dr.

Green-Cheatwood informed plaintiff of his job’s termination and provided him with a

termination letter on February 12, 2020. Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xxi.). And firing

qualifies as a materially adverse action. See Argo v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kan., Inc., 452

F.3d 1193, 1202 (10th Cir. 2006) (“[H]e was fired, which obviously qualifies as ‘materially

adverse[.]’”). So, plaintiff’s prima facie case of termination-based retaliation under Title VII

comes down to the third prong: causation.

        Recall that a plaintiff establishing a prima facie retaliation case must show “‘a causal

connection existed between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.’” Bekkem,

915 F.3d at 1267 (quoting Khalik, 671 F.3d at 1193). And as “a prerequisite to this showing,

[plaintiff] must first come forward with evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could

conclude that those who decided to fire him had knowledge of his protected activity.” Hinds v.

Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 523 F.3d 1187, 1203 (10th Cir. 2008). “An employer’s action against

an employee cannot be because of that employee’s protected opposition unless the employer

knows the employee has engaged in protected opposition.” Petersen v. Utah Dep’t of Corr., 301

F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original). “Plaintiff must therefore point to

evidence that those who acted against him knew of his formal complaints.” Singh v. Cordle, 936

F.3d 1022, 1043 (10th Cir. 2019). And “bare speculation” supporting an employer’s knowledge



7
        Defendants’ brief doesn’t contest that terminating plaintiff qualifies as an adverse action. It does
contest plaintiff’s ability to establish a materially adverse action, however, on another basis: MEC’s
request for plaintiff to submit to a psychological evaluation. Doc. 173 at 27. But defendants
misapprehend the basis of plaintiff’s Title VII claim. Plaintiff clarifies in his Response that he doesn’t
argue that the psychological evaluation request was a materially adverse action. See Doc. 183 at 36 n.11.

                                                         15
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 16 of 55




of plaintiff’s protected opposition won’t suffice. Lindsay v. Denver Pub. Schs., 88 F.4th 1323,

1328 (10th Cir. 2023).

        Here, defendants argue that plaintiff fails to provide evidence of the requisite knowledge

to establish a causal connection. Doc. 173 at 29–30. That is, plaintiff hasn’t adduced evidence

that the decision makers who fired him knew of his protected activity, defendants contend. Id.

Without adducing evidence of such knowledge, defendants argue, plaintiff’s claim fails. Id. Not

so fast, plaintiff responds. While plaintiff concedes that the decision makers who terminated him

didn’t possess knowledge of his protected activity, he claims that doesn’t end the analysis.8 Doc.

183 at 40–41. Instead, plaintiff argues, the “cat’s paw” doctrine9 applies here. Id.

        “On a cat’s paw theory of liability the influence of [a] biased subordinate provides the

causal connection the plaintiff’s prima facie case requires[.]” Lawrence v. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 560

F. App’x 791, 795 (10th Cir. 2014). That’s so because “even though the ultimate


8
         Plaintiff also argues that the close temporal proximity between plaintiff’s January 2020 written
and oral complaints and his termination in February 2020 “by itself, shows causation.” Doc. 183 at 36.
To be sure, “a plaintiff may show a causal connection by presenting evidence that the ‘temporal
proximity’ between the protected conduct and the materially adverse action justifies an inference of
retaliatory motive.” Singh, 936 F.3d at 1043 (quotation cleaned up). Nonetheless, “a plaintiff who seeks
to show causation [by temporal proximity] still must present evidence that the decisionmakers knew of the
protected conduct.” Id. (emphasis in original). So, plaintiff’s temporal proximity causation argument
doesn’t take care of the knowledge question. That is, the alleged temporal proximity doesn’t, “by itself,”
demonstrate causation and plaintiff still must rely on the cat’s paw doctrine.
9
        The Tenth Circuit previously explained the etymology of the cat’s paw doctrine. This etymology
contributes to a fuller understanding of the doctrine, so the court recites it here:

        The cat’s paw doctrine derives its name from a fable, made famous by La Fontaine, in
        which a monkey convinces an unwitting cat to pull chestnuts from a hot fire. As the cat
        scoops the chestnuts from the fire one by one, burning his paw in the process, the monkey
        eagerly gobbles them up, leaving none left for the cat. . . . In the employment
        discrimination context, “cat’s paw” refers to a situation in which a biased subordinate, who
        lacks decisionmaking power, uses the formal decisionmaker as a dupe in a deliberate
        scheme to trigger a discriminatory employment action.

E.E.O.C. v. BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of L.A., 450 F.3d 476, 484 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotation cleaned
up).

                                                        16
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 17 of 55




decisionmakers weren’t biased it was still because of bias that the employee suffered the adverse

action.” Id. “[T]o survive summary judgment when asserting the cat’s-paw theory of liability, a

plaintiff must show that there is a genuine issue of material fact that (1) the subordinate took

action motivated by discriminatory animus; (2) the subordinate intended the action to cause an

adverse employment action, and (3) the subordinate’s actions proximately caused the intended

adverse employment action.” Singh, 936 F.3d at 1038.

       Here, it’s undisputed that Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel jointly decided to terminate

plaintiff’s employment. Doc. 173-3 at 3 (Lichtenberger Dep. 24:8–24); Doc. 183 at 14

(disputing the veracity of the information on which Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel relied, but

not disputing whether they made the firing decision). It’s also undisputed that they didn’t know

of plaintiff’s complaints about Dr. Kessler. Doc. 173-3 at 13 (Lichtenberger Dep. 62:18–24);

Doc. 183 at 15. At first blush, that seems to end the issue. When a plaintiff doesn’t “come

forward with evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that those who

decided to fire him had knowledge of his protected activity[,]” his claim fails. Hinds, 523 F.3d

at 1203. But, plaintiff retorts, Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel decided to terminate him based

on information provided by Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey. Doc. 183 at 15; Doc. 173-3 at

4 (Lichtenberger Dep. 25:6–27:21). And so, plaintiff argues, Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel

were innocent cats with burned paws. That is, Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel simply did the

bidding of Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey, who, plaintiff asserts, were motivated by

retaliatory animus.

       For plaintiff here to invoke the cat’s paw doctrine successfully, he first must establish a

genuine issue of material fact from which a jury could infer that retaliatory animus motivated a

subordinate’s action. Plaintiff contends that Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey imputed



                                                     17
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 18 of 55




retaliatory bias to the decision makers, Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel. And plaintiff asserts

that a reasonable juror could infer Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey’s retaliatory bias based

on the evidence of pretext plaintiff provides. Doc. 183 at 41.

       A plaintiff appropriately may rely on pretext evidence at the causation stage, Tenth

Circuit precedent holds. See Proctor v. United Parcel Serv., 502 F.3d 1200, 1209 (10th Cir.

2007) (identifying that the Tenth Circuit has taken into account pretext evidence in a retaliation

claim’s prima facie stage) (citing Wells v. Colo. Dep’t of Transp., 325 F.3d 1205, 1218 (10th Cir.

2003) (analyzing causation element of prima facie case for Title VII retaliation claim by

addressing pretext evidence)). But here plaintiff takes a spaghetti-on-the-wall approach to

pretext, rattling off no fewer than 13 theories to see which one will stick. Doc. 183 at 38–39.

And plaintiff’s burden at the prima facie causal connection stage differs from plaintiff’s burden

at the pretext stage. See Annett v. Univ. of Kan., 371 F.3d 1233, 1241 (10th Cir. 2004) (“The

burden of establishing a prima facie case in the McDonnell Douglas framework is not

onerous. . . . [But in the] pretext analysis . . . the burden is more demanding and requires a

plaintiff to assume the normal burden of any plaintiff to prove his or her case at trial.” (quotation

cleaned up)). So, if the court engages in a full analysis of plaintiff’s pretext arguments here—

under the prima facie burden—it would have to revisit that entire analysis under plaintiff’s

higher burden of pretext below. The court declines. And so, the court assumes—without

deciding—that a reasonable juror could infer Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey’s retaliatory

animus under one of the many pretext arguments plaintiff proffers. And the court thus moves on

to the second step of the cat’s paw doctrine. And no one need worry that the court has

abandoned the pretext analysis. The court will return to these pretext arguments under

McDonnell Douglas’s third step later in this Order. See § IV.A.3.



                                                     18
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 19 of 55




       The second cat’s paw theory prong requires a plaintiff to show a genuine issue of

material fact that “the subordinate intended the action to cause an adverse employment action[.]”

Singh, 936 F.3d at 1038. The most obvious actions relevant here are Dr. Green-Cheatwood and

Mr. Sabey’s acts of conducting investigative interviews and then reporting their findings to the

decision makers. And plaintiff has adduced evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to infer

that Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey intended those interviews and that reporting to cause

plaintiff’s firing. Dr. Green-Cheatwood, for her part, expressly relied on the information

procured in the interviews to recommend that Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel fire plaintiff.

Doc. 173-9 at 22 (Green-Cheatwood Dep. 157:5–158:24). And Mr. Sabey testified that the

whole point of investigating was to provide information about the interviews so the decision

makers could rely on it. Doc. 173-5 at 23 (Sabey Dep. 158:8–159:8). Both subordinates thus

drew a straight-line between the action of engaging in the interview process and firing plaintiff,

satisfying prong two.

       The third prong of the cat’s paw theory requires plaintiff to show a genuine issue of

material fact that “the subordinate’s actions proximately caused the intended adverse

employment action.” Singh, 936 F.3d at 1038. Our Circuit requires the subordinate’s

involvement to surpass “mere influence or input in the decisionmaking process.” BCI Coca-

Cola, 450 F.3d at 487 (quotation cleaned up). Instead, “the biased subordinate’s discriminatory

reports, recommendation, or other actions [must have] caused the adverse employment action.”

Id. Here, the court concludes, a reasonable juror could infer from the February 10, 2020, phone

conversation that Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey’s interview reports caused Dr.

Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel to fire plaintiff. Dr. Lichtenberger testified that he had relied on

Mr. Sabey’s verbal report about the interviews in making his firing decision. Doc. 173-3 at 5–6



                                                    19
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 20 of 55




(Lichtenberger Dep. 32:8–33:9). And he testified that he relied on Dr. Green-Cheatwood’s

representations about the investigations, as well. Id. at 4 (Lichtenberger Dep. 25:6–27:16). And

he had to rely in this fashion. Dr. Lichtenberger was new to his position—he had worked for

defendants for just one month when he fired plaintiff—and he didn’t know plaintiff at all. Id. at

3 (Lichtenberger Dep. 23:3–24:7). He identified Mr. Sabey as his source to confirm that the

interviews substantiated the allegations against plaintiff. See id. at 5 (Lichtenberger Dep. 32:11–

16). Mr. Gessel, for his part, doesn’t recall who made plaintiff’s termination decision, whether

he was involved in that decision, or why plaintiff was fired. Doc. 183-12 at 3–4 (Gessel Dep.

41:12–42:16). He could surmise, however, that Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey supported

firing plaintiff because, since they were the ones involved in the discussion, he “probably would

have remembered [any] objection.” Id. at 5 (Gessel Dep. 43:21–25). While Mr. Gessel’s

testimony proves less definitive, Dr. Lichtenberger’s suffices to show a genuine issue of material

fact from which a reasonable juror could infer that Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey’s report

caused plaintiff’s firing, satisfying the third prong of the cat’s paw doctrine.

       And so, assuming cat’s paw liability, the court concludes that plaintiff otherwise has

established a prima facie case for a Title VII retaliation claim premised on his termination.

               2.      Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason

       If plaintiff “establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to [the

employer] to assert a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action.” Proctor, 502

F.3d at 1208. If the employer “provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision,

the burden shifts back to [plaintiff] to show that [the employer’s] proffered reason is a pretext

masking discriminatory animus.” Id. (quotation cleaned up).




                                                      20
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 21 of 55




       Our Circuit has explained that the defendant employer, at this second step, doesn’t “‘need

to litigate the merits of the reasoning, nor does it need to prove that the reason relied upon was

bona fide, nor does it need to prove that the reasoning was applied in a nondiscriminatory

fashion.’” Frappied v. Affinity Gaming Black Hawk, LLC, 966 F.3d 1038, 1058 (10th Cir. 2020)

(quoting E.E.O.C. v. Flasher Co., 986 F.2d 1312, 1316 (10th Cir. 1992)). That is, defendants’

“burden is one of production, not persuasion; it can involve no credibility assessment.” Carter v.

Pathfinder Energy Servs., Inc., 662 F.3d 1134, 1149 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting Reeves v.

Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000)). “‘[T]his stage of the analysis only

requires the defendant to articulate a reason for the [employment decision] that is not, on its face,

prohibited’ and that is ‘reasonably specific and clear.’” Frappied, 966 F.3d at 1058 (first

alteration in original) (quoting Flasher, 986 F.2d at 1316 & n.4). So, according to our Circuit’s

authority, a party’s burden to demonstrate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason is “exceedingly

light.” Bekkem, 915 F.3d at 1268 (quotation cleaned up).

       Here, defendants offer four legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for firing plaintiff.

They harbored concerns about plaintiff: (i) abandoning patients in the ICU; (ii) poorly

documenting patients’ status; (iii) potentially exercising poor clinical judgment; and (iv)

stopping some of the peer review components in his role as CMO. Doc. 173-3 at 4

(Lichtenberger Dep. 25:6–26:19). Defendants’ reasons for firing plaintiff aren’t prohibited

facially—so, defendants have satisfied their burden at this step. The court needn’t litigate the

merits of firing plaintiff for these reasons, nor need it determine whether any of these four

reasons were bona fide. Instead, because defendants’ burden at this stage is exceedingly light,

defendants’ showing qualifies as a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason satisfactory to discharge

defendants’ burden at step two. Frappied, 966 F.3d at 1058. This claim’s disposition thus turns

        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 22 of 55




on whether plaintiff has adduced sufficient evidence to identify a triable issue of pretext under

McDonnell Douglas step three.

               3.      Pretext

        At the third step of the McDonnell Douglas framework, the burden shifts back to

plaintiff. Now, plaintiff must present a genuine issue of material fact that defendants’ asserted

reasons for terminating his employment were pretextual. To meet this burden, plaintiff must

provide evidence that “the employer’s explanation was so weak, implausible, inconsistent or

incoherent that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that it was not an honestly held belief but

rather was subterfuge for discrimination” or retaliation. Young v. Dillon Cos., 468 F.3d 1243,

1250 (10th Cir. 2006). To analyze whether a reasonable juror could find pretext under this

standard, the court doesn’t ask “whether the employer’s reasons were wise, fair or correct[.]”

Riggs v. AirTran Airways, Inc., 497 F.3d 1108, 1118 (10th Cir. 2007). Instead, the court asks

“whether the employer honestly believed its reasons and acted in good faith upon them.” Id. at

1119.

        The court thus evaluates “the facts as they appeared to the person making the decision,”

and doesn’t “second-guess the employer’s decision even if it seems in hindsight that the action

taken constituted poor business judgment.” Id. “The reason for this rule is plain: [the court’s]

role is to prevent intentional discriminatory [employment] practices, not to act as a ‘super

personnel department,’ second guessing employers’ honestly held (even if erroneous) business

judgments.” Young, 468 F.3d at 1250; see also Rivera v. City & Cnty. of Denver, 365 F.3d 912,

925 (10th Cir. 2004) (“‘An articulated motivating reason is not converted into pretext merely

because, with the benefit of hindsight, it turned out to be poor business judgment.’” (quoting

McKnight v. Kimberly Clark Corp., 149 F.3d 1125, 1129 (10th Cir. 1998))).

        Plaintiff’s pretext arguments fall into four categories10: defendants’ inconsistent and

uncorroborated reasons for plaintiff’s termination; the temporal proximity between protected

activity and termination; defendants’ failure to conduct reasonable and sufficient investigations;

and defendants’ failure to follow normal policies and procedures. Doc. 183 at 38–39. The court

concludes that plaintiff hasn’t adduced sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue that

defendants’ rationale for his termination is pretext for retaliation. The court explains this

conclusion by addressing each pretext argument, below.

                       i.        Inconsistent and Uncorroborated Reasons

        First, plaintiff argues that defendants offer inconsistent and uncorroborated reasons for

firing plaintiff. The Tenth Circuit has “held that a jury can reasonably infer pretext when an


10
         Plaintiff’s Response brief lists 13 different pretext arguments. Doc. 183 at 38–39. The court
identified significant overlap in several of these enumerated arguments. So, the court streamlined the
arguments into four overarching categories. This footnote explains the four pretext arguments that
capture all of plaintiff’s pretext theories.

        First, the court grouped together arguments about defendants’ inconsistent and uncorroborated
reasons for plaintiff’s termination including: “(a) Defendants provided changing, inconsistent, and post-
hoc reasons for termination[;]” “(b) Many irregularities, inconsistencies, and fact disputes regarding the
alleged reasons for termination[;]” and “(c) Witnesses did not actually corroborate the stated reasons for
termination[;]” “(e) Reasons were inconsistent with performance assessments, objective data, and recent
contract renewal and recredentialing[;] and “(f) CEO Taylor . . . said [plaintiff’s] performance was good,
he met all quality care metrics, and termination was ‘unwarranted’ and ‘wrong.’” Id.

         Second, the court grouped together arguments about temporal proximity including: “(m)
Temporal proximity between protected activity and termination” and “(i) [o]ngoing concern over
[plaintiff’s] complaints about Kessler that continued up to termination.” Id.

         Third, the court grouped together arguments about failure to conduct reasonable and sufficient
investigations including: “(d) Failure to conduct a reasonable investigation[;]” “(l) Investigation of
[plaintiff] was conducted ‘solely because of’ the KBHA complaint . . . which . . . was retaliatory[;]” and
“(h) Disparate treatment of other doctors . . . (failure to interview)[;]” and “(j) Failure to conduct a
reasonable investigation into Byrnes’ complaints about Kessler.” Id.

         Last, the court grouped together arguments about defendants’ failure to follow normal policies
and procedures: “(g) Not following policies and normal procedures in numerous respects[;]” and “(k)
failure to follow policy and normal procedure in that investigation.” Id.

employer is inconsistent in the reasons it provides for the termination.” Fassbender v. Correct

Care Sols., LLC, 890 F.3d 875, 887 (10th Cir. May 2018) (quotation cleaned up). “Such

inconsistencies include abandoning explanations that the employer previously asserted[,]” id., or

affirmatively disclaiming a proffered rationale. Whittington v. Nordam Grp. Inc., 429 F.3d 986,

994 (10th Cir. 2005). But “merely providing additional non-discriminatory reasons for the

termination is not enough to establish pretext, especially where the additional reasons are not

contradictory.” Rolland v. Carnation Bldg. Servs., Inc., 739 F. App’x 920, 924 (10th Cir. 2018)

(collecting cases). “Rather, inconsistency evidence is only helpful to a plaintiff if the employer

has changed its explanation under circumstances that suggest dishonesty or bad faith.”

Litzsinger v. Adams Cnty. Coroner’s Off., 25 F.4th 1280, 1291 (10th Cir. 2022) (quotation

cleaned up); see also Mueggenborg v. Nortek Air Sols., LLC, No. 20-6147, 2021 WL 4807176, at

*8 (10th Cir. Oct. 15, 2021) (assuming employer provided an “inconsistent explanation” for

firing plaintiff but concluding that the circumstances still did “not suggest [the employer]

changed its explanation under circumstances that suggest dishonesty or bad faith”).

       Here, plaintiff explains, various spokespersons for defendants emphasized different

termination reasons, which, plaintiff argues, amounts to an inconsistency sufficient for a

reasonable juror to infer pretext. Doc. 183 at 38. As explained above under McDonnell

Douglas’s stage two, defendants identified four reasons—across their spokespersons and

decision makers—to fire plaintiff: abandoning patients in the ICU; poorly documenting patients’

status; potentially exercising poor clinical judgment; and stopping some of the peer review

components in his role as CMO. Doc. 173-3 at 4 (Lichtenberger Dep. 25:6–26:19). And the

summary judgment evidence supports plaintiff’s contention that the various spokespersons

emphasized one reason over another. But those varying emphases don’t equal inconsistent



                                                    24
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 25 of 55




reasons. Indeed, the different spokespersons—even when emphasizing one primary firing

reason—also cited other reasons, as well.

       Decision maker Dr. Lichtenberger identified patient abandonment in the ICU as his

primary concern but noted all four reasons in his deposition testimony. Id. For example, even as

Dr. Lichtenberger prioritized the alleged abandoning of patients, he, too, referenced plaintiff’s

neglect in “doing some of the peer review components.” Id. (Lichtenberger Dep. 25:6–26:16).

Similarly, defendants’ corporate witness echoed Dr. Lichtenberger’s concern about patient

abandonment but also cited “clinical competency” concerns. Doc. 183-8 at 22–23 (Eklund Dep.

62:23–63:1). And outside counsel framed the primary issue leading to plaintiff’s firing as

shutting down the peer review system, but he also discussed the “inappropriateness of

[plaintiff’s] patient care.” Doc. 183-34 at 1 (Pl. Ex. D2). To be sure, defendants identified

multiple reasons, and different spokespersons did so with differing emphases. But defendants

never abandoned or affirmatively disclaimed any of their reasons. See Whittington, 429 F.3d at

994.

       What’s more, the four reasons cited by defendants are “not contradictory” to one another.

See Rolland, 739 F. App’x at 924. Plaintiff could have abandoned patients in the ICU and

interfered with the peer review system when serving as CMO; these actions aren’t mutually

exclusive. Nor has plaintiff adduced evidence of “circumstances that suggest dishonesty or bad

faith.” Litzsinger, 25 F.4th at 1291. A given spokesperson prioritizing one reason—while still

citing other reasons consistent with other spokespersons—doesn’t suggest dishonesty or bad

faith. Id. In sum, despite the multitude of reasons and the varying speakers’ different emphases,

the summary judgment evidence reveals sufficient overlap in the reasons given to preclude an

inference of pretext premised on inconsistent reasons.



                                                    25
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 26 of 55




       Next, plaintiff contends defendants’ termination reasons were uncorroborated. Doc. 183

at 38. He argues that witnesses and previous assessments of plaintiff’s work don’t align with

defendants’ termination reasons. Id. And he argues that CEO Taylor’s perspective that

plaintiff’s firing was unwarranted and wrong likewise demonstrates uncorroborated reasons.

Finally, he argues that he had no role in stopping the peer review system, so this reason, too, was

uncorroborated. But a reasonable juror couldn’t infer from the summary judgment evidence here

that defendants’ termination reasons were uncorroborated. Here’s why: Five different doctors

had brought similar concerns about plaintiff’s patient care to CEO Taylor in April 2019, before

plaintiff engaged in the protected activity at issue here. Doc. 173-2 at 5 (Taylor Dep. 133:23–

135:21); Doc. 173-13 at 4 (Arroyo Dep. 31:24–32:5) (explaining that in April 2019 five doctors

communicated to CEO Taylor the same concerns about plaintiff that Dr. Arroyo reiterated to Mr.

Sabey in the investigative interview). And at that time, the five doctors requested that SCH fire

plaintiff. Doc. 173-2 at 5 (Taylor Dep. 133:23–135:21). But instead of firing plaintiff in April

2019, CEO Taylor removed him as CMO. Id. (Taylor Dep. 135:2–8); Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial

Order ¶ 2.a.xiii.). More importantly, whether those five doctors were correct in their assessments

about plaintiff’s patient care issues isn’t something for the court to decide here. The court

doesn’t need to hash out whether defendants’ deciding to fire plaintiff was “wise, fair or

correct[.]” Riggs, 497 F.3d at 1118. Instead, the court evaluates merely “whether the employer

honestly believed its reasons and acted in good faith upon them.” Id. at 1119. And the April

2019 meeting suggests, at the very least, that patient care concerns weren’t uncorroborated.

Even if those concerns never made it into a formal assessment or CEO Taylor didn’t agree that

they warranted termination, there were doctors who corroborated the patient care concerns

before any protected activity.



                                                    26
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 27 of 55




       Nor is it of any moment that plaintiff contends the peer review termination reason is

false. Again, the court evaluates “the facts as they appeared to the person making the decision,”

and evaluates “whether the employer honestly believed its reasons and acted in good faith upon

them.” Riggs, 497 F.3d at 1119 (emphasis added). The summary judgment evidence suggests

that the decision makers—Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel—and those influencing the decision

makers—Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey—understood that plaintiff bore responsibility for

the hospital’s inadequate peer review system. See Doc. 173-5 at 16 (Sabey Dep. 115:21–116:8);

Doc. 173-9 at 9–10 (Green-Cheatwood Dep. 83:19––85:3). Mr. Sabey came to that

understanding from the interviews. Doc. 173-5 at 16 (Sabey Dep. 115:21–116:8). Dr. Green-

Cheatwood arrived at that conclusion from her own CMO experience. Doc. 173-9 at 9–10

(Green-Cheatwood Dep. 83:19––85:3). And Dr. Lichtenberger relied on the information he

received from Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey. Doc. 173-3 at 4, 5–6 (Lichtenberger Dep.

25:6–27:16, 32:8–33:9). The court needn’t decide whether plaintiff was at fault for the peer

review system stalling out; just whether the decision makers, when firing plaintiff, thought he

was at fault. And plaintiff hasn’t presented a triable issue about the decision makers’

understanding. Instead, plaintiff disputes his role in the peer review interference with deposition

testimony from CEO Taylor and Ms. Killion. Doc. 183 at 31. But CEO Taylor wasn’t part of

the decision making process. Doc. 173-2 at 5 (Taylor Dep. 133:8–12). So, his understanding

about how the peer review system became defunct sheds no light on how the facts appeared to

the people making the decision to terminate. And plaintiff cites the deposition testimony of Ms.

Killion. Doc. 183 at 31. But she testified that she doesn’t recall discussing the peer review

process in the interview with Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey. Doc. 183-16 at 40 (Killion

Dep. 120:10–121:3). Her understanding, therefore, also didn’t reach the ears of the decision



                                                    27
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 28 of 55




makers. In sum, none of the evidence plaintiff cites creates a triable issue about the decision

makers’ understanding of the peer review debacle.

       So, the court concludes, plaintiff hasn’t created a triable issue that the absence of

corroborating evidence—in the form of witnesses, performance assessments, CEO Taylor’s

judgment, or a false peer review reason—demonstrates pretext. See Sarrai v. Azar, Civ. No. 16-

1299 KK/SCY, 2018 WL 6833408, at *13 (D.N.M. Dec. 28, 2018) (“[T]hat [defendants] failed

to confirm the complaints’ accuracy does not give rise to a reasonable inference that their stated

reliance on these complaints is pretextual.”). The court moves on to plaintiff’s next pretext

argument: temporal proximity.

                     ii.      Temporal Proximity

       Second, plaintiff argues, the temporal proximity of his re-upped sexual harassment

complaints (in January 2020) to his firing (in February 2020) creates a triable issue of pretext.

Doc. 183 at 39. This temporal proximity pretext argument is particularly compelling, plaintiff

asserts, because the concerns about plaintiff’s protected activity were ongoing, continuing up to

just weeks before termination. Id. But here’s the problem: the concerns that surfaced in the

interviews—and that decision makers relied on to fire plaintiff—emerged before plaintiff’s

protected activity in August 2019. That five-doctor meeting with CEO Taylor in April 2019

manifested many of the same concerns, thus mitigating against a plausible finding of pretext on

temporal proximity grounds. What’s more, “close temporal proximity can support a finding of

pretext only in combination with other evidence of pretext.” Lobato v. N. M. Env’t Dep’t, 733

F.3d 1283, 1293 (10th Cir. 2013). And, as discussed more fully below, no other evidence of

pretext here contributes to the requisite combination.




                                                    28
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 29 of 55




                     iii.      Unreasonable Investigation

       Third, plaintiff contends that defendants’ failure to conduct reasonable investigations

demonstrates pretext. Doc. 183 at 38. In assessing an investigation in the context of a pretext

analysis, the Tenth Circuit doesn’t focus on whether that investigation is “optimal (i.e., text-book

best practices)” but instead on whether it “was fair.” Dewitt v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 845 F.3d 1299,

1315 (10th Cir. 2017). That is, a “failure to conduct . . . a fair investigation of the violation that

purportedly prompted adverse action may support an inference of pretext.” Smothers v. Solvay

Chemicals, Inc., 740 F.3d 530, 542 (10th Cir. 2014) (quotation cleaned up). Smothers is

instructive here. In Smothers, the employer fired an employee by relying on information from

just one side of an employment dispute. Id. And the employer actively refused to let plaintiff

talk about the quarrel. Id. The Tenth Circuit held that this coupling of one-sided reliance and

active refusal sufficed for a reasonable jury to infer pretext. Id. at 543. The Tenth Circuit later

framed Smothers’ employer as having “deliberately prevented the plaintiff from responding to

the allegations against him.” Gupta v. Okla. City Pub. Schs., No. 21-6138, 2022 WL 1742048, at

*6 (10th Cir. May 31, 2022). On the other hand, where an employer acknowledged that plaintiff

disputed the accusations against him—but declined to rely on plaintiff’s representation about the

conflict—the Tenth Circuit found no such inference of pretext. Id. That is, “an employer

may . . . ‘defeat the inference’ of pretext stemming from an allegedly unfair investigation by

‘simply asking an employee for his version of events.’” Dewitt, 845 F.3d at 1314 (quoting BCI

Coca-Cola, 450 F.3d at 488).

       Here, plaintiff argues, defendants conducted an unreasonable investigation after receiving

the KBHA subpoena primarily by criticizing who defendants chose to interview—and who they

chose not to interview. Plaintiff contends that defendants didn’t interview “other obvious



                                                      29
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 30 of 55




witnesses” like nurses or a co-surgeon, didn’t interview plaintiff himself,11 didn’t consider

“readily available provider data,” and accepted “biased witnesses’ allegations without verifying

them.” Doc. 183 at 38. But an “optimal,” “best practices” investigation isn’t required. Dewitt,

845 F.3d at 1315. And defendants’ decision to interview doctors, instead of nurses, makes sense

given that the doctors—in light of their expertise and experience—likely were better placed to

identify issues with plaintiff’s performance as a doctor. To be sure, considering provider data

undoubtedly falls into the best practices category. But such data rarely tells the whole story.

And—once again—best practices aren’t required.

        So, at bottom, a single phone call is the most important event for the court to evaluate

pretext here. It is undisputed that Dr. Green-Cheatwood conversed with plaintiff about the

KBHA complaint—the subject of the allegedly unreasonable investigation—on January 30,

2020. Doc. 183-24 at 3 (Byrnes Decl. ¶ 11). And it is undisputed that plaintiff, during this



11
         Plaintiff also cites this “failure to interview” in a separate pretext argument about disparate
treatment of other doctors. Doc. 183 at 38. But the evidence plaintiff adduces as disparate treatment for
the termination decision all centers on the unreasonableness of the investigation. This evidence includes:
a failure to interview other informed witnesses; a failure to interview a co-surgeon in one of plaintiff’s
cases reviewed by Dr. Green-Cheatwood; a failure to interview plaintiff; and a failure to provide plaintiff
with an opportunity to respond. Because these instances of alleged disparate treatment thus center on the
reasonableness of defendants’ investigation, the court doesn’t address a disparate treatment pretext
argument separately here. It is subsumed in plaintiff’s pretext argument based on unreasonable
investigation.

         And even if it did address disparate treatment separately, the court could dispense with the
argument quickly. “A plaintiff may show pretext by providing evidence that he was treated differently
from other similarly-situated, nonprotected employees who violated work rules of comparable
seriousness.” Smothers, 740 F.3d at 540 (quotation cleaned up). Plaintiff adduces no evidence
suggesting anyone had complained to the KBHA about the allegedly similarly-situated doctors, or that
KBHA had issued a subpoena against these other allegedly similarly-situated doctors. And that report
and subpoena drove the investigation here. So, plaintiff fails to adduce disparate treatment evidence to
establish pretext.

        The only other disparate treatment evidence plaintiff adduces involves a Report of Adverse
Findings submitted to KBHA months after plaintiff was fired. But here the court addresses just evidence
about defendants’ termination decision. So, the court doesn’t take up that disparate treatment argument
here.

                                                        30
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 31 of 55




conversation, told Dr. Green-Cheatwood that the allegations were false. Id. And that’s not all.

Plaintiff also pleaded his case. He cited specific data showing his mortality rate, recited his work

experience as a surgeon, and even reviewed his litigation record (just two unsuccessful lawsuits

against him in 12.5 years in practice). Id.; Doc. 174-29 at 1 (Def. Ex. 46). Finally, he identified

medical staff members who would support him. Doc. 183-24 at 3 (Byrnes Decl. ¶ 12); Doc. 174-

29 at 1 (Def. Ex. 46).

        This conversation ends the analysis about the KBHA complaint investigation. During the

phone call, plaintiff provided “‘his version of events.’” Dewitt, 845 F.3d at 1314 (quoting BCI

Coca-Cola, 450 F.3d at 488). And that’s a far cry from “deliberately prevent[ing] the plaintiff

from responding to the allegations against him.” Gupta, 2022 WL 1742048, at *6. To be sure,

defendants didn’t interview plaintiff formally during their investigation. And perhaps such a

formal interview would constitute a best practice. But, one more time, an “optimal”

investigation isn’t the standard. Dewitt, 845 F.3d at 1315. And neglecting to provide plaintiff a

second, more formal opportunity to defend himself isn’t required.12 See Daimaru v. Wayfair,

LLC, 631 F. Supp. 3d 1069, 1085 (D. Utah 2022) (“[Defendant’s] failure to ask for more

information is not the same as a deliberate attempt to prevent her from arguing her case.”).

Finally, just because defendants chose not to rely on plaintiff’s representations, but instead relied

on those of other witnesses, it doesn’t follow that a reasonable juror properly could infer pretext.




12
        The court recognizes that plaintiff had this conversation with Dr. Green-Cheatwood alone. But it
is undisputed that Dr. Green-Cheatwood sent an email to Mr. Sabey summarizing the phone call. Doc.
174-29 (Def. Ex. 46). And plaintiff argues that Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey influenced the
decision makers to the point of imputing their own biases, see § IV.A.1. above. That argument cuts both
ways. If Dr. Green-Cheatwood and Mr. Sabey’s perspectives so influenced the termination decision, then
this phone call suffices as an opportunity for plaintiff to tell defendants his version of the events.


                                                      31
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 32 of 55




See Gupta, 2022 WL 1742048, at *6. And so, the January 30, 2020, conversation negates any

inference of pretext stemming from an allegedly unfair investigation into the KBHA complaint.

        A similar analysis overwhelms any inference of pretext premised on the investigation into

plaintiff’s complaints about Dr. Kessler. Again, plaintiff takes issue with the choice of

witnesses, noting that defendants only interviewed one nurse and didn’t interview the ICU

nurses’ boss until just before plaintiff’s firing. Doc. 183 at 4. But the nurse who defendants

interviewed was the one nurse plaintiff alleged Dr. Kessler had harassed—a logical choice. Doc.

183-14 at 19 (Hauer Dep. 40:7–17); Doc. 174-17 at 2 (Def. Ex. 34) (explaining that plaintiff’s

complaint included “a single incident” involving the nurse interviewed). And SCH’s Human

Resources Director interviewed that nurse within one week of plaintiff’s written complaint. Doc.

174-18 at 1 (Def. Ex. 35). The nurse explained in the interview that the allegedly inappropriate

touching was simply when “the doctor had brushed up against [her]” and that she “was not

uncomfortable.” Id. She also commented that she “was surprised” the person reporting the

incident said anything and surmised that the person reporting it “must have taken it wrong”

because the brushing up “did not bother [her].” Id. To be sure, the nurse told plaintiff the

touching was “weird and inappropriate.” Doc. 183-32 at 1 (St. Clair Decl. ¶ 7). But she never

claims to have made any such representation to the Human Resources Director—instead the

nurse says she doesn’t recall their conversation.13 Id. at 1–2 (St. Clair Decl. ¶ 9). In light of such




13
         The summary judgment record appears to contain evidence manifesting a dispute over what
precisely this same nurse told Dr. Freund when he interviewed her on behalf of the MEC. Dr. Freund
claims she never said the touching was “weird and inappropriate,” but she says she did. See Doc. 183-11
at 17–18 (Freund Dep. 65:23–66:12); Doc. 183-32 at 2 (St. Clair Decl. ¶ 10). But the court has
determined that the MEC wasn’t plaintiff’s employer. See § V.A.; Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.x.).
So, the court focuses here on what defendants—plaintiff’s employer—did in their investigation of the
Kessler complaint.

                                                      32

statements to HR, defendants’ decision not to pursue other interviews seems—perhaps not

“optimal”—but at least explicable. Dewitt, 845 F.3d at 1315.

        What’s more, plaintiff again had occasion to provide “‘his version of events’” during his

October 16, 2019, meeting with Dr. Freund, Dr. Green-Cheatwood, and Dr. Stucky. Id. at 1314

(quoting BCI Coca-Cola, 450 F.3d at 488); Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xvi.). At the

meeting, plaintiff not only reiterated his concerns about Dr. Kessler but also expressed his views

about the thoroughness of the investigation. Doc. 174-61 at 2 (Def. Ex. 67); Doc. 183-6 at 50–52

(Byrnes Dep. 181:21–183:10). Once again, defendants’ request that plaintiff attend this meeting

and explain his version of events surrounding the Kessler complaint “‘defeat[s] the inference’ of

pretext stemming from an allegedly unfair investigation[.]” Dewitt, 845 F.3d at 1314 (quoting

BCI Coca-Cola, 450 F.3d at 488). And so, plaintiff is left with one final pretext argument:

deviation from normal policies and procedures.

                      iv.        Deviation from Normal Policies and Procedures

        Fourth, plaintiff asserts that defendants’ failure to follow their normal policies and

procedures allows an inference of pretext. Doc. 183 at 38. As evidence, plaintiff invokes CEO

Taylor’s not participating in the firing decision and defendants’ practice of resolving patient care

issues with a doctor by discussing it with him, not firing him.14




14
         Plaintiff adduces other evidence as well, but the court needn’t address it here. First, plaintiff
invokes Dr. Green-Cheatwood’s review of plaintiff’s cases. Doc. 183 at 12–13, 39. But plaintiff himself
identifies that Dr. Green-Cheatwood didn’t review the relevant case until after plaintiff’s firing and
concedes that Dr. Green-Cheatwood’s “opinions regarding that procedure could not have formed a basis
for [plaintiff’s] termination.” Id. at 12–13. If any alleged issues with Dr. Green-Cheatwood’s review
didn’t influence plaintiff’s firing, the court needn’t address that pretext argument here. Second, plaintiff
cites shortcomings of the KBHA complaint’s investigation—neglecting to interview plaintiff, neglecting
to interview other witnesses, such as nurses, and neglecting to review quality data—as evidence of
procedural deviation. Id. at 38. And he also cites the Kessler complaint investigation’s shortcomings—
neglecting to interview more than one nurse. But the court has addressed these arguments already in
§ IV.A.3.iii., above, and so it needn’t take them up again here.

        A showing of pretext premised on a deviation from procedure requires evidence that the

defendant acted (i) “contrary to a written company policy[;]” (ii) contrary to “an unwritten

policy[;]” or (iii) “contrary to company practice when making the adverse employment

decision.” Kendrick v. Penske Transp. Servs., Inc., 220 F.3d 1220, 1230 (10th Cir. 2000)

(quotation cleaned up). “However, ‘deviations from normal company procedures’ provide

support for an assertion of pretext only when they can be considered ‘disturbing procedural

irregularities.’” May v. Cockman, No. CV 13-1021 GBW/KK, 2016 WL 10591979, at *8

(D.N.M. Jan. 28, 2016) (quoting Doebele, 342 F.3d at 1138 n.11). “A plaintiff who wishes to

show that the company acted contrary to an unwritten policy or to company practice often does

so by providing evidence that he was treated differently from other similarly-situated employees

who violated work rules of comparable seriousness.” Kendrick, 220 F.3d at 1230. In this

similarly-situated analysis, a court should “compare the relevant employment circumstances,

such as work history and company policies, applicable to the plaintiff and the intended

comparable employees in determining whether they are similarly situated.” Aramburu v. Boeing

Co., 112 F.3d 1398, 1404 (10th Cir. 1997).

        Here, plaintiff never adduces evidence of any written policies that defendants violated

when reaching a decision to terminate him.15 So, he must rely either on unwritten policies or

company practice to establish pretext by deviation. To establish pretext based on CEO Taylor

not participating in the termination decision, plaintiff adduces just one scrap of evidence: CEO

Taylor’s subjective belief. CEO Taylor testified that he “believe[d]” it would be atypical to


15
        Plaintiff adduces evidence of written SCH and Centura policies about the peer review process and
a physician’s opportunity to respond to cases under review. Doc. 184-3 (Pl. Ex. D6); Doc. 184-24 (Pl.
Ex. E167). But plaintiff clarifies in his briefing that the quality review to which these policies apply “did
not occur until after [plaintiff’s] termination[.]” Doc. 183 at 21. So, the court doesn’t take into account
these written policies in assessing whether defendants’ termination reasons were pretextual.


                                                         34
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 35 of 55




exclude the CEO and that it “seemed unusual” that the CEO wouldn’t know the reason for a

termination decision. Doc. 183-20 at 42, 45 (Taylor Dep. 117:17–20; 120:7–24). But CEO

Taylor’s belief, without more, doesn’t reach the level of a “disturbing procedural irregularit[y].”

May, 2016 WL 10591979, at *8. And, although plaintiff’s argument may have some logical

appeal at first blush, it fades when one considers the CEO’s position in the relevant hierarchy

here. Centura employed both decision makers16 whereas SCH employed Taylor. Doc. 183-20 at

2 (Taylor Dep. 12:11–25). And CEO Taylor explains that he “reported directly to the Centura

leadership team” and functioned as Centura’s “agent” whose “authority came directly from their

delegated authority[.]” Id. So, while one logically might assume a CEO would make hiring and

firing decisions, the analysis changes when the CEO is the agent of an overarching corporation

like Centura. As such, CEO Taylor not participating in the firing decision doesn’t help plaintiff

here. In sum, plaintiff hasn’t adduced evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to infer that

defendants’ termination reasons were pretextual based on CEO Taylor’s un-involvement in the

firing decision.

       Nor does defendants’ decision to fire plaintiff for his alleged patient care issues—instead

of discussing those issues with him and coaching him through them—allow an inference of

pretext. To argue pretext here, plaintiff cites CEO Taylor’s testimony about one or two older

radiologists who the hospital thought it might need to remove from reading mammograms

because they misread them. Doc. 183-20 at 49–51 (Taylor Dep. 128:17–130:2). To CEO

Taylor’s knowledge—he left SCH during this time—those radiologists continued to work at the

hospital but with more extensive oversight and increased peer review requirements. Id.

        Mr. Gessel held the position of Group President of Centura’s Greater Colorado Kansas (GCK)

Alignment. Doc. 173 at 10, 15.

       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 36 of 55




Essentially, this evidence invokes the similarly-situated employee argument: Because those

radiologists weren’t fired but instead received increased monitoring, defendants should have

taken a similar approach to plaintiff’s patient care issues. And so, he argues, a reasonable juror

can infer defendants’ proffered termination reasons were pretextual because defendants treated

plaintiff differently than a similarly-situated employee. But plaintiff’s pretext argument fails

because those radiologists weren’t similarly situated employees, at least not under the controlling

legal definition of the term.

       A similarly-situated employee is one who “violated work rules of comparable

seriousness.” Aramburu, 112 F.3d at 1404. But here, defendants’ concerns about the allegedly

similarly-situated radiologists were limited to one discrete issue: the accurate reading of

mammograms. And, while such an issue is less-than-ideal, defendants could address it easily by

putting checks in place to confirm correct diagnoses. The work rules plaintiff allegedly violated

were myriad, not singular, and not so easily addressed with simple double-checks and oversight.

The KBHA complaint against plaintiff summarized ten different allegations. These included:

“multiple alarming adverse outcomes, including multiple patient deaths[;]” “pressuring hospital

CEO Scott Taylor to disband the hospital peer review committee[;]” “an unusually high number

of nicked bowels during surgeries[;]” “abandon[ing] 8 I.C.U. cases[;]” “transferring out patients

that he has dangerously mismanaged[;]” and “well known incidents of sexual relations in

hospital treatment rooms with nurses.” Doc. 174-31 at 6 (Def. Ex. 48). The KBHA complaint

also described his fellow physicians’ concerns: “[T]he medical staff has advised the CEO that he

is unsafe and needs an assessment due to his erratic behaviors and dangerous violations of the

standard of care.” Id. Such numerous and serious allegations preclude the argument that




                                                    36
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 37 of 55




plaintiff and the radiologists were similarly-situated employees who “violated work rules of

comparable seriousness.” Aramburu, 112 F.3d at 1404.

       Nor does plaintiff adduce evidence about the “relevant employment circumstances” of

those radiologists, allowing the court to categorize them as similarly-situated employees. Id. In

his pretext section, plaintiff doesn’t adduce any evidence of the radiologists’ work history or of

company policies, which is necessary to compare plaintiff and the radiologists as similarly-

situated. Id.; see Doc. 183 at 38. Instead, plaintiff merely cites CEO Taylor’s account of the

radiologists’ treatment. See Doc. 183 at 38 (citing to PSAF 142 at Doc. 183 at 34). And CEO

Taylor couldn’t remember whether defendants removed either radiologist from patient care,

though he thought they continued practice. Doc. 183-20 at 50 (Taylor Dep. 129:5–11). Nor was

CEO Taylor in defendants’ employ long enough to know with any certainty the ultimate outcome

of the radiologists’ saga. Id. (Taylor Dep. 129:9–18). Absent more substantial evidence, no

reasonable juror could infer pretext based on defendants’ deviation from company policy as

demonstrated by their differential treatment of plaintiff and the radiologists.

                     v.        Pretext Conclusion

       In sum, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue about whether the proffered

reasons for his termination were pretextual. The arguments based on inconsistent and

uncorroborated reasons; temporal proximity; unreasonable investigation; and failure to follow

normal policies and procedures are insufficient, taken separately and together, for a reasonable

jury to conclude that defendants’ termination reasons were pretext for a retaliatory discharge.

Defendants thus are entitled to summary judgment on the claim of Title VII termination-based

retaliation. The court addresses plaintiff’s other Title VII claim, next.

       B.      Title VII Review Process Retaliation Claim

       Plaintiff also contends under Title VII that defendants targeted him and treated him

differently in the 2020 quality review process. Doc. 183 at 36. Recall that plaintiff, to state a

prima facie case for retaliation, must show that (1) he engaged in protected opposition, (2) to a

reasonable worker, the challenged employment action is materially adverse, and (3) the

protected activity and the materially adverse action were connected causally. Bekkem, 915 F.3d

at 1267. If plaintiff presents a prima facie case of retaliation, then defendant must respond with a

legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for the challenged action. Parker Excavating, Inc. v. Lafarge

W., Inc., 863 F.3d 1213, 1220 (10th Cir. 2017). If defendant satisfies this burden, plaintiff must

show that defendant’s reason was merely a pretext for retaliation. Id.

       Once again, plaintiff’s first protected action—filing complaints against Dr. Kessler for

alleged sexual harassment—is stipulated and undisputed. Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial Order

¶ 2.a.xv.). And plaintiff’s second action—filing an EEOC charge—likewise qualifies as

protected activity. See Anderson v. Coors Brewing Co., 181 F.3d 1171, 1178 (10th Cir. 1999)

(“By filing an EEOC claim, Plaintiff engaged in protected activity.”) So, plaintiff easily meets

the first prong of a prima facie case. And as with plaintiff’s other Title VII claim, the second

prong of the prima facie analysis here is also straightforward. Defendants don’t dispute that

reporting to a state regulatory board constitutes a materially adverse action. See Doc. 173 at 26–

31. Their position makes sense. As another court has explained:

       It is difficult to see how threatening to report Plaintiff to the state licensing board,
       who presumably has the ability to revoke Plaintiff’s license and thus impede his
       ability to work in his profession, could not be an adverse employment action. A
       reasonable employee could be dissuaded from engaging in protected speech if they
       knew their employer would take steps to limit their ability to work in their
       profession[.]

Bogden-Cozmuta v. Granby Urgent Care, LLC, No. 20-CV-00879-VLB, 2022 WL 4585442, at

*7 (D. Conn. Sept. 29, 2022). The proverbial rubber once again meets the road, therefore, on the

causation prong.

        To establish the requisite causal connection between his protected conduct and the

materially adverse action, plaintiff must adduce evidence capable of supporting a reasonable

finding that a desire to retaliate against him for his complaints about Dr. Kessler or EEOC charge

filing motivated defendants to adopt retaliatory processes when they decided to report his cases

to KBHA. Plaintiff’s two causation theories sound like this: (1) Dr. Stucky and Dr. Green-

Cheatwood identified, with a retaliatory motive, specific cases of plaintiff’s for peer review; and

(2) Drs. Stucky and Green-Cheatwood manipulated the peer review committee to deny plaintiff

the opportunity—which it had provided to other doctors—to respond to the reviewed cases

before reporting those cases to KBHA. Doc. 183 at 41. Here’s the problem with these

theories.17

        Plaintiff has come forward with no evidence to demonstrate that the reviewing committee

knew of his protected activities. And neither of his theories establishes the requisite knowledge.

Recall that a plaintiff asserting a claim of retaliation “must first come forward with evidence

from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that those who decided to take adverse action

against him had knowledge of his protected activity.” Singh, 936 F.3d at 1043 (quotation

cleaned up). So, unless plaintiff adduces evidence to demonstrate that the decision makers

themselves had knowledge of plaintiff’s protected activities, this theory of causation fails. See


17
         Notice that neither causation theory involves the EEOC charge filing as protected activity.
Plaintiff fails to offer any theory where the peer review committee—who, the court determines, are the
decision makers here—have knowledge of his EEOC filing. See generally Doc. 183. And so, plaintiff’s
claim—as premised on the EEOC filing as protected activity—fails. And the court doesn’t address it in
the analysis here. The court explains this conclusion more fully when, below, it addresses plaintiff’s
ADA retaliation claim premised on the EEOC charge filing. See § V.B.

                                                      39

Henderson v. Stormont-Vail Healthcare, Inc., 607 F. Supp. 3d 1173, 1189 (D. Kan. 2022)

(“Without evidence that these committee members had knowledge of plaintiff’s complaint,

plaintiff necessarily cannot establish the requisite causation between her complaint and the

[standard of care violation] finding.”).

       To address his knowledge problem, plaintiff first urges the court to view Dr. Stucky and

Dr. Green-Cheatwood—not the committee—as the decision makers because they chose the cases

and passed the information on to the committee. Doc. 183 at 41. The court isn’t persuaded. It

declines to equate choosing which cases to place before a committee at an outside facility with

deciding how appropriate or egregious those cases were. In his alternative theory, plaintiff

accepts the committee as the decision maker but contends that the doctors manipulated the

committee such that the committee didn’t allow plaintiff to offer input. Id. This theory fails as

well. As discussed before, to rely on a cat’s paw theory of liability—such as this alleged

manipulation requires—the subordinate’s involvement must surpass “mere influence or input in

the decisionmaking process.” BCI Coca-Cola, 450 F.3d at 487 (quotation cleaned up). Instead,

“the biased subordinate’s discriminatory reports, recommendation, or other actions [must have]

caused the adverse employment action.” Id. Plaintiff hasn’t adduced any evidence to show the

doctors exercised anything beyond influence or input in the decisionmaking process here. To be

sure, deciding which cases a committee reviews constitutes influence. But it doesn’t cause the

committee to find those cases were handled so poorly or inappropriately that they must report

them to KBHA. What’s more, the members of the peer review committee were from another

hospital. Doc. 183-22 at 8 (Vogel Dep. 46:3–24). They worked and conducted peer review at a

sister facility—not SCH—and this arrangement arose from an intentional attempt to ensure an

“unbiased, robust peer review[.]” Id. Such geographical removal casts doubt on the Dr. Green-



                                                    40
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 41 of 55




Cheatwood and Dr. Sabey’s ability to manipulate the committee. And so, plaintiff’s failure to

adduce evidence of the committee’s protected activity knowledge persists.

       In his last-ditch effort, plaintiff attempts to cure this knowledge problem one final way:

by adducing evidence that Dr. Green-Cheatwood singled out one of plaintiff’s cases to Rebecca

Vogel. Doc. 183 at 20. Dr Vogel served as chair of the peer review committee and the email she

received from Dr. Green-Cheatwood revealed plaintiff’s identity, which should have remained

undisclosed. Doc. 184-33 at 2–3 (Pl. Ex. E234). But that Dr. Vogel knew plaintiff’s identity

isn’t evidence that Dr. Vogel knew about plaintiff’s protected activities. This is especially so

here because Dr. Vogel led peer review conducted by at an outside, sister facility—not SCH—

and so plaintiff’s identity alone was less likely to divulge his protected activities. Doc. 183-22 at

8 (Vogel Dep. 46:3–24).

       But let’s just say it did disclose those protected activities. Still, one person’s sole

knowledge—when a group is deciding something—isn’t sufficient to establish the requisite

causation. See Flores v. DeJoy, No. 19-CV-00784-LF-JHR, 2021 WL 2186240, at *10 (D.N.M.

May 28, 2021) (“The biggest problem for [plaintiff] in showing a causal connection . . . is that

only one person involved in the process . . . was aware that [plaintiff] had filed an EEO

complaint.”). Instead, a plaintiff must demonstrate not just a single person’s knowledge, but also

that the group mentioned or considered the protected activity when reaching its decision. See id.

(“Given that [plaintiff] has no evidence that his EEO activity was even mentioned, much less

considered, when the committee made its decision, and that only one member of the committee

even knew about his EEO activity, no reasonable jury could find a causal connection[.]”); see

also Henderson, 607 F. Supp. 3d at 1191 (“While Dr. Sachs was one of th[e] members [of the




                                                     41

decision making committee], there is no evidence that he influenced the decision in any way or

that he shared his knowledge of plaintiff’s complaint.”).

          Plaintiff thus fails to come forward with evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to infer

a causal connection between his protected activities and the processes that led to SCH reporting

his cases to KBHA. And without the requisite causal connection, plaintiff’s Title VII retaliation

claim based on the peer review process can’t stand. The court grants defendants summary

judgment on Count 1. And the court moves on to address plaintiff’s other set of federal claims,

below.

V.        ADA Claims (Count 3)

          Plaintiff brings two claims under Count 3, both premised on the Americans with

Disabilities Act. Doc. 165 at 17–18 (Pretrial Order ¶ 4.a.iii.). One claim asserts that defendants

wrongly perceived or regarded plaintiff as disabled because he filed a protected complaint. Id.

The second claim asserts that defendants violated the ADA by retaliating against plaintiff after

he filed EEOC charges of discrimination. Id. The court addresses each claim, in turn.

          Recall that the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies with equal force

to plaintiff’s ADA claims. See Morgan, 108 F.3d at 1323 (applying framework to ADA

disability discrimination claim); Doebele, 342 F.3d at 1135 (applying framework to ADA

retaliation claim). And so, the court begins with this now familiar question: Has plaintiff

established a prima facie case for each ADA claim?

     A.       “Regarded As” ADA Disability Claim18

          Plaintiff claims that defendants violated the ADA by wrongly perceiving plaintiff to have

a mental disability because he filed a protected complaint. Doc. 165 at 17–18 (Pretrial Order


18
          The Pretrial Order asserts two claims under the ADA. Doc. 165 at 17–18 (Pretrial Order
¶ 4.a.iii.). The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (“ADAAA”) amended the ADA and “went into effect on

                                                       42
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 43 of 55




¶ 4.a.iii.). And plaintiff contends, as a result of that wrong perception, defendants fired him.

Doc. 183 at 46. The ADA prohibits covered employers from discriminating against a “qualified

individual on the basis of disability” in hiring, advancement, training, termination, and “other

terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a). “To establish a prima

facie case of employment discrimination under the ADA, [plaintiff] must present evidence that

(1) he is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he is qualified to perform the essential

functions of his job with or without accommodations; and (3) he was terminated under

circumstances which give rise to an inference that the termination was based on his disability.”

Smothers, 740 F.3d at 544 (quotation cleaned up). Under the first prong of the prima facie case,

“being regarded as” having a disability qualifies as being disabled. 42 USC § 12102(1)(C).

        “Under the ADAAA, for a plaintiff alleging disability discrimination to show that the

employer regarded him as having an impairment, the plaintiff must show that (1) he has an actual

or perceived impairment, (2) that impairment is neither transitory nor minor, and (3) the

employer was aware of and therefore perceived the impairment at the time of the alleged

discriminatory action.” Adair, 823 F.3d at 1306. That is, to establish the first prong a prima

facie case of ADA discrimination based on plaintiff’s perceived mental disability, plaintiff must

adduce evidence that—applying the three elements outlined above—defendants regarded




January 1, 2009.” Dewitt, 845 F.3d at 1303 n.1. Here, the “events that form the basis for [plaintiff’s]
disability-related claims occurred after this date; therefore, the ADAAA is technically applicable here.”
Id. So, the court “refer[s] to [plaintiff’s] disability-related claims . . . as claims alleging violations of the
ADAAA.” Id. Also, as our Circuit has noted, the 2008 amendments “primarily” revised “the ADA’s
definition of ‘disability.’” Id. And the ADAAA modified the scope of a “regarded as” claim by defining
“being regarded as having such an impairment” as not requiring that “‘the impairment limits or is
perceived to limit a major life activity.’” Adair v. City of Muskogee, 823 F.3d 1297, 1305 (10th Cir.
2016) (quoting 42 USC § 12102(3)(A)). Because this modified scope affects plaintiff’s claims here, the
court’s analysis relies principally on cases decided after the ADAAA’s effective date.


                                                            43
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 44 of 55




plaintiff as having an impairment. Having satisfied that first prong,19 plaintiff then must adduce

evidence that the circumstances of his termination give rise to the inference that it was based on

his perceived disability. Smothers, 740 F.3d at 544. The court thus addresses, first, whether

plaintiff has adduced evidence to show that defendants regarded him as having an impairment.

Then, the court takes up whether the circumstances of his termination allow a reasonable juror to

infer that defendants premised that termination on his perceived disability.

        Here, plaintiff doesn’t come forward with evidence that he had an actual or perceived

impairment, thus failing to establish the first prong of a prima facie case for “regarded as” ADA

discrimination. In his attempt to meet his burden that he had a perceived impairment, plaintiff

adduces evidence that the Medical Executive Committee (MEC) requested he undergo a

psychological evaluation. Doc. 174-23 (Def. Ex. 40) (letter from MEC to plaintiff

recommending psychological evaluation). And while this evidence, on its face, might seem

sufficient to permit a finding that plaintiff had a perceived impairment, a sister circuit has

determined—even after the 2008 ADA Amendments Act broadening the “regarded as” claim—

that a request for psychological evaluation isn’t enough to suggest that the employer regarded

plaintiff as disabled. Krueger v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 674 F. App’x 490, 494 (6th Cir. 2017)

(“Asking [the employee] to undergo a psychological evaluation is not enough to suggest that

Home Depot regarded [the employee] as mentally disabled.”). And other circuits held the same

before the ADAAA took effect. See Stewart v. County of Brown, 86 F.3d 107, 111 (7th Cir.

1996) (affirming that an employer’s ordering “a number of psychological evaluations for


19
         The parties don’t dispute the second prong of a prima facie ADA disability discrimination case:
that plaintiff “is qualified to perform the essential functions of his job with or without
accommodations[.]” Smothers, 740 F.3d at 544. See 183 at 46 n.15 (“Defendants did not contest that
[second] element, which is not surprising given that [plaintiff] did not actually have any impairment. In
any event, there is an abundance of evidence that [plaintiff] was qualified.”). And so, the court’s analysis
doesn’t address this second prong.

demonstrate that employer perceived plaintiff as impaired).

        But even if plaintiff had adduced evidence capable of establishing that the MEC regarded

plaintiff as impaired, his prima facie case would fail on the third element of the “regarded as”

test. That is, plaintiff hasn’t adduced evidence of circumstances which permit a reasonable juror

to infer that defendants fired plaintiff based on his perceived disability. To be sure, defendants

were aware of a perceived impairment at the time of termination, having first heard concerns

about plaintiff’s mental state in September 2019 from members of the Medical Executive

Committee. See Doc. 174-21 (Def. Ex. 38) (explaining the MEC’s concerns about plaintiff’s

mental state in a September 2019 email to Dr. Green-Cheatwood, Physician Executive for

Centura’s GKC group); Doc. 173-11 at 3–4 (Dunford Dep 32:21–35:1) (testifying that Dr.

Dunford reached out to Nancy Killion, Centura’s Director of Quality, in September 2019—

shortly after learning about plaintiff’s letter of complaint—because of concerns about his

impairment). And plaintiff argues that these “internal communications show [defendants]

believed [plaintiff] had such an impairment because of his protected complaints about Kessler[.]”

Doc. 183 at 46. But that perception isn’t all an ADA claim requires.

        Circumstances must allow a reasonable juror to infer that plaintiff’s employer fired

plaintiff based on the perceived disability. But all the evidence plaintiff adduces to demonstrate

his perceived mental state centers on the Medical Executive Committee (MEC), who wasn’t

plaintiff’s employer. Doc. 173-4 at 6 (Gessel Dep. 48:7–16) (“Whether it’s employment or new



                                                       45
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 46 of 55




contracts or termination of existing contracts, those weren’t the purview of the hospital board.”);

see also Doc. 165 at 3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.x.) (“For purposes of [plaintiff’s] Title VII and ADA

claims, the Hospital and Centura concede that they jointly employed [plaintiff].”). It is

undisputed that the MEC had no power to make employment decisions about employed

physicians. Doc. 173 at 2–3; Doc. 183 at 3. And so, plaintiff needed to adduce evidence of

circumstances surrounding his firing that allow an inference that SCH or Centura—not the

MEC—perceived he had an impairment. But he didn’t adduce any. Indeed, defendants—his

employers—didn’t take any action or indicate in any way that they might terminate plaintiff

when the MEC concerns surfaced in September 2019. Instead, defendants acted four months

later—and only after the KBHA complaint and subpoena—arrived early in 2020. And plaintiff

hasn’t adduced any evidence to suggest that those affiliated with defendants who knew about the

MEC concerns—Dr. Green-Cheatwood, Nancy Killion, and Mr. Sabey—ever expressed those

concerns to Dr. Lichtenberger and Mr. Gessel, the persons who decided to terminate plaintiff.

       And so, even when the court assumes defendants perceived plaintiff as having an

impairment—a generous assumption given the case law about psychological evaluations—

plaintiff still hasn’t adduced sufficient evidence that the circumstances of his termination give

rise to an inference that defendants based it on his perceived disability. Plaintiff’s ADA

“regarded as” disability discrimination claim thus fails at the prima facie stage and the court

grants summary judgment to defendants on this claim. Now, to plaintiff’s second ADA claim.

       B.      ADA Retaliation Claim

       In the Pretrial Order, plaintiff premises his second ADA claim on defendants’ “retaliating

against [plaintiff] when they took adverse action against him after he filed EEOC charges of

discrimination alleging Defendants violated the ADA.” Doc. 165 at 17–18 (Pretrial Order



                                                    46
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 47 of 55




¶ 4.a.iii.). But then, in his Response to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, plaintiff

changes his tack. He reframes his ADA retaliation claim and premises it on his “January 2020

opposition to being wrongly regarded as disabled and asked to undergo medical examination.”

Doc. 183 at 46. And, as a result, plaintiff argues in his Response that defendants’ “actions to fire

him and subject him to their pretextual quality investigation . . . create an inference that ADA

retaliation caused those actions.” Id. That is, instead of premising his ADA retaliation claim on

his filing an EEOC charge—which first happened in May 2020—plaintiff scoots his premise for

retaliatory conduct back in time. In his Response, plaintiff attempts to alter the premise of his

ADA claim to his January 2020 letter opposing the psychological evaluation request. And that

changed premise would allow plaintiff’s ADA retaliation claim to encompass both his firing and

the case peer review that followed. But that’s a problem. Here’s why.

       Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(d) provides that the pretrial order “controls the course of the action”

unless modified by the court. What’s more, “‘[c]laims, issues, defenses, or theories of damages

not included in the pretrial order are waived.’” Zenith Petrol. Corp. v. Steerman, 656 F. App’x

885, 887 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting Cortez v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc., 460 F.3d 1268, 1276–77

(10th Cir. 2006)). Courts must construe pretrial orders liberally “‘to cover any of the legal or

factual theories that might be embraced by their language.’” Id. (quoting Trujillo v. Uniroyal

Corp., 608 F.2d 815, 818 (10th Cir. 1979)). Nonetheless, pretrial orders require the parties to

disclose the “real issues” preserved for trial to “avoid surprise.” Id. (quotation cleaned up).

       Here, the court entered the Pretrial Order on January 23, 2024, before defendants filed

their summary judgment motion. Doc. 165. The court has reviewed the Pretrial Order and

concludes that it placed defendants on notice of just one basis for plaintiff’s ADA retaliation

claim: his filing of EEOC charges. Id. at 17–18 (Pretrial Order ¶ 4.a.iii.). And that claim wasn’t



                                                     47
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 48 of 55




broadly worded to permit the court to construe it liberally to include plaintiff’s January 2020

opposition letter. What’s more, plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint unequivocally indicates

that the EEOC filing forms the grounds for his ADA retaliation claim. Doc. 87 at 16 (3d Am.

Compl. ¶¶ 126–27) (“Dr. Byrnes engaged in activity protected by the ADA by filing EEOC

Charges against the Defendants. . . . Defendants retaliated against Dr. Byrnes because he

engaged activity protected by the ADA, in violation of the ADA.”). The court can’t read the

Pretrial Order or Third Amended Complaint to place defendants on notice of any other theory of

recovery for ADA retaliation. And so, the court evaluates plaintiff’s ADA retaliation claim as

based solely on his filing of EEOC charges—and not his January 2020 opposition. As a result,

this ADA claim doesn’t encompass plaintiff’s firing, as explained, below.

       The ADA prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who engage in an

activity protected by that act. See 42 U.S.C. § 12203(a)–(b). To make a prima facie case of

ADA retaliation, plaintiff must show that “(1) he engaged in a protected activity; (2) he was

subjected to an adverse employment action subsequent to or contemporaneous with the protected

activity; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse

employment action.” Foster v. Mountain Coal Co., LLC, 830 F.3d 1178, 1187 (10th Cir. 2016).

(quotation cleaned up).

       Here, the court already has identified plaintiff’s sole protected activity—his EEOC

charge filing. See Anderson, 181 F.3d at 1178 (“By filing an EEOC claim, Plaintiff engaged in

protected activity.”). And that protected activity determines the timeframe of relevant adverse

employment actions. That is, plaintiff solely may allege adverse employment actions

“subsequent to or contemporaneous with the protected activity[.]” Foster, 830 F.3d at 1187.

Here, plaintiff filed his first EEOC claim on May 1, 2020. Doc. 87 at 9 (3d Am. Compl. ¶ 67).



                                                    48
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 49 of 55




So, the court only needs to evaluate those adverse employment actions occurring on or after May

1, 2020.

       Defendants fired plaintiff on February 12, 2020. Doc. 165 at 4 (Pretrial Order ¶ 2.a.xxi.).

So that adverse action is out. Defendants also engaged in a review process of cases that plaintiff

contends demonstrates a retaliatory motive because of his disparate treatment in the process

compared to other doctors. And that process led to defendants reporting some of plaintiff’s cases

to KBHA. That one happened in the proper timeframe. The court already has determined that

such reporting qualifies as an adverse employment action. See § IV.B. So, on this review

process basis, plaintiff has satisfied the first two prongs of a prima facie ADA retaliation claim.

All that remains is prong three: the causal connection between his EEOC filing and defendants’

reporting to KBHA.

       But, as with the Title VII claim premised on the review process discussed above, see

§ IV.B., here, too, plaintiff has a causation problem. Recall that a plaintiff asserting a claim of

retaliation “must first come forward with evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could

conclude that those who decided to take adverse action against him had knowledge of his

protected activity.” Singh, 936 F.3d at 1043 (10th Cir. 2019) (quotation cleaned up). But here,

doctors in a different, sister facility conducted the review process. Doc. 183-22 at 8 (Vogel Dep.

46:3–24). And, although Dr. Stucky and Dr. Green-Cheatwood determined which cases to send

to that review committee, the court already has concluded that this didn’t turn them into

decision-makers. See § IV.B., above. So, the relevant decision makers are, yet again, the peer

review committee. This means that plaintiff—to discharge the requirement of a causal

connection—must adduce evidence that those review committee decision makers had knowledge

of his EEOC charge filing. And plaintiff hasn’t adduced such evidence—at all—zero. See



                                                     49
         Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 50 of 55




§ IV.B.n.18; see also generally Doc. 183. Here too, then, plaintiff fails to establish a prima facie

case of ADA retaliation on the final prong—causation. And without a prima facie case,

plaintiff’s claim can’t stand. The court thus grants defendants summary judgment against

plaintiff’s ADA claims (Count 3). Having thus granted summary judgment on all of plaintiff’s

federal claims, the court takes up plaintiff’s state claims, below.

VI.      State Law Claims

         In addition to his federal claims, plaintiff asserts state and common law claims for

Retaliation (Count 2), Fraud (Count 4), Fraud by Silence (Count 5), Promissory

Estoppel/Detrimental Reliance (Count 7) and Common Law Retaliation for protected activity—

under the Kansas Wage Payment Act (Count 10). Doc. 165 at 17–18 (Pretrial Order ¶ 4.a.ii., iv.–

vii.).

         Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3), the court may decline to exercise supplemental

jurisdiction over state law claims if it has “dismissed all claims over which it has original

jurisdiction[.]” Section 1367 “reflects the understanding that, when deciding whether to exercise

supplemental jurisdiction, ‘a federal court should consider and weigh in each case, and at every

stage of the litigation, the values of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.’” City

of Chi. v. Int’l Coll. of Surgeons, 522 U.S. 156, 173 (1997) (quoting Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v.

Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 350 (1988)). In “the usual case in which all federal-law claims are

eliminated before trial, the balance of factors to be considered under the [supplemental]

jurisdiction doctrine—judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity—will point toward

declining to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.” Carnegie-Mellon Univ.,

484 U.S. at 350 n.7. Also, “[n]otions of comity and federalism demand that a state court try its

own lawsuits, absent compelling reasons to the contrary.” Thatcher Enters. v. Cache Cnty.

Corp., 902 F.2d 1472, 1478 (10th Cir. 1990).
                                                     50
        Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 51 of 55




        Our Circuit has expressed its preference that, when a district court dismisses all federal

claims, it typically should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims.

See Smith v. City of Enid ex rel. City Comm’n, 149 F.3d 1151, 1156 (10th Cir. 1998) (“When all

federal claims have been dismissed, the court may, and usually should, decline to exercise

jurisdiction over any remaining state claims.” (emphasis added)). But still, the decision is

committed to the district court’s sound discretion. Exum v. U.S. Olympic Comm., 389 F.3d 1130,

1138–39 (10th Cir. 2004).

        The court, in its discretion, declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff’s

state law claims. The court finds no compelling reasons to depart from our Circuit’s general

directives. Fairness and comity lead the court to conclude that a Kansas state court should

resolve plaintiff’s Kansas state law claims.

VII.    Other Pending Motions

        The court also takes this opportunity to rule other pending motions associated with the

summary judgment briefing: three sealing motions and one disregard or surreply motion. The

court starts with the sealing motions.

        A.      Sealing Motions (Doc. 176; Doc. 188; Doc. 194)

        Defendants have filed two Motions for Leave to File Under Seal (Doc. 176; Doc. 194)

and plaintiff has filed one Motion for Leave to File Exhibits Under Seal (Doc. 188). All three

sealing motions are unopposed.20 The parties ask the court to seal in their entirety—or give

leave to file redacted versions of—specified exhibits filed with their supporting summary

judgment memorandums.



20
         Defendants’ first sealing motion (Doc. 176) left ambiguous plaintiff’s position about their
specific sealing and redacting requests. See Doc. 176 at 4. But plaintiff’s counsel later communicated
informally to chambers, clarifying that plaintiff didn’t oppose defendants’ motion.

                                                       51
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 52 of 55




       The Supreme Court recognizes a “general right to inspect and copy public records and

documents, including judicial records and documents.” Nixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435

U.S 589, 597 (1978) (citations omitted). Nevertheless, a party may rebut the presumption of

access to judicial records by demonstrating that “countervailing interests heavily outweigh the

public interests in access.” Mann v. Boatright, 477 F.3d 1140, 1149 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotation

cleaned up). The party seeking to deny access must shoulder the burden to establish a

sufficiently significant interest outweighing the presumption of access. Id. (quotation cleaned

up); see also United States v. Bacon, 950 F.3d 1286, 1293 (10th Cir. 2020) (“The party seeking

to keep records sealed bears the burden of justifying that secrecy,” and it must “articulate a

sufficiently significant interest that will justify continuing to override the presumption of public

access.” (quotation cleaned up)).

       This legal standard requires federal courts to assess competing interests: the general right

of public access weighed against an interest in protecting certain information from disclosure.

When engaging in this endeavor, district courts have substantial discretion. See, e.g., Nixon, 435

U.S. at 599 (“[T]he decision [about] access [to judicial records] is one best left to the sound

discretion of the trial court[.]”); see also Mann, 477 F.3d at 1149 (“Whether judicial records and

other case-related information should be sealed or otherwise withheld from the public is a matter

left to the sound discretion of the district court.” (citation omitted)). Applying this standard, the

court finds that the parties’ need to preserve confidentiality here outweighs the public’s right to

access because the material at issue falls into two categories meriting protection: (i) patient

identity and medical information; and (ii) confidential and proprietary business information.

And our Circuit has clarified that “[m]edical records and confidential business records are




                                                     52
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 53 of 55




examples of the types of private information this court has allowed to be sealed.” Luo v. Wang,

71 F.4th 1289, 1304 (10th Cir. 2023).

       Having reviewed the exhibits at issue in these three sealing motions, the court concludes

that each falls appropriately within one of these two categories. And the court notes that the

parties diligently have sought limited redactions to preserve public access whenever possible.

So, the court grants defendants’ Motions for Leave to File Under Seal (Doc. 176; Doc. 194) and

plaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File Exhibits Under Seal (Doc. 188).

       B.      Motion to Disregard or for Leave to File Surreply (Doc. 195)

       The final pending motion that spins out of the summary judgment briefing is plaintiff’s

Motion to Disregard Defendants’ New Evidence or, in the Alternative, for Leave to File a

Surreply (Doc. 195). Plaintiff asks the court to disregard new materials attached to defendants’

Reply brief (Doc. 189).

       Our Circuit answered “whether the district court may consider evidence and issues raised

by the party moving for summary judgment in a reply brief without allowing the opposing party

to respond” in Beaird v. Seagate Tech., Inc., 145 F.3d 1159, 1164 (10th Cir. 1998). It

determined that a district court has “two permissible courses of action” in this situation: the

court may “permit[] a surreply or, in granting summary judgment for the movant, it [may]

refrain[] from relying on any new material contained in the reply brief.” Id.; see also Doebele,

342 F.3d at 1139 n.13 (10th Cir. 2003) (concluding “the court abused its discretion to the extent

it relied on new evidentiary materials presented for the first time in [defendant’s summary

judgment] reply brief” because the district court denied plaintiff’s motion to file a surreply);

Green v. New Mexico, 420 F.3d 1189, 1196 (10th Cir. 2005) (explaining that a district court

choosing not to rely on new evidence raised in a summary judgment reply brief “does not abuse

its discretion by precluding a surreply” (quotation cleaned up)). Here, the court grants movants
                                                     53
       Case 2:21-cv-02086-DDC Document 200 Filed 09/05/24 Page 54 of 55




summary judgment. And it does so without relying on any of the new evidence filed with

defendants’ Reply brief. So, the court follows the second permissible course of action identified

by our Circuit. It grants the portion of plaintiff’s motion requesting that it disregard defendants’

new materials filed on reply and denies the portion of plaintiff’s motion requesting leave to file a

surreply.

VIII. Conclusion

       For the reasons stated in this Memorandum and Order, the court grants defendants’

Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 172) against plaintiff’s retaliation claims under Title VII

and plaintiff’s “regarded as” discrimination and retaliation claims under the ADA. The court

dismisses plaintiff’s state law claims without prejudice. The court also grants the parties’

Motions for Leave to File Under Seal (Doc. 176; Doc. 188; Doc. 194). And it grants in part and

denies in part plaintiff’s Motion to Disregard Defendants’ New Evidence or, in the Alternative,

for Leave to File a Surreply (Doc. 195). The court directs the Clerk to enter Judgment consistent

with this Memorandum and Order and close this case.

       IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED BY THE COURT THAT defendants’ Motion for

Summary Judgment (Doc. 172) is granted.

       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED BY THE COURT THAT the parties’ Motions for Leave

to File Under Seal (Doc. 176; Doc. 188; Doc. 194) are granted.

       The court directs the Clerk to remove the provisional designation and leave permanently

under seal the following Doc. 174 exhibits: Doc. 174-27, Doc. 174-30, Doc. 174-33, Doc. 174-

36, Doc. 174-43, Doc. 174-44, Doc. 174-57, Doc. 174-58, and Doc. 174-62. And the court

directs the Clerk to unseal any provisionally sealed exhibits in Doc. 174 not enumerated here.

       The court also directs the Clerk to remove the provisional designation and leave

permanently under seal the following Doc. 184 exhibits: Doc. 184-5, Doc. 184-11, Doc. 184-21,
                                                     54

Doc. 184-30, Doc. 184-31, and Doc. 184-33. And the court directs the Clerk to unseal any

provisionally sealed exhibits in Doc. 184 not enumerated here.

       The court also directs the Clerk to remove the provisional designation and leave

permanently under seal the following Doc. 190 exhibit: Doc. 190-1. And the court directs the

Clerk to unseal the other provisionally sealed exhibit in Doc. 190 not enumerated here.

       The court further directs defendants to file the redacted version—previously submitted to

chambers by email—of the following exhibits: Doc. 174-27, Doc. 174-30, Doc. 174-33, Doc.

174-36, Doc. 174-43, Doc. 174-44, Doc. 174-58, Doc. 174-62, and Doc. 190-1.

       Finally, the court directs plaintiff to file the redacted version—previously submitted to

chambers by email—of the following exhibits: Doc. 184-5, Doc. 184-11, Doc. 184-21, Doc.

184-30, and Doc. 184-33.

       IF IS FURTHER ORDERED BY THE COURT THAT plaintiff’s Motion for Leave

to Disregard Defendants’ New Evidence or, in the Alternative, for Leave to File a Surreply (Doc.

195) is granted in part and denied in part. The court grants plaintiff’s request to disregard

defendants’ new evidence and denies plaintiff’s request for leave to file a surreply.

       IT IS SO ORDERED.

       Dated this 5th day of September, 2024, at Kansas City, Kansas.
