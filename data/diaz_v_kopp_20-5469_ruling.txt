stated in the Court's Opinion and Order dated June 27, 2022, MJ Davison's R&R is ADOPTED 
in its entirety, Petitioner's objections are OVERRULED, and the Petition is DISMISSED.

1997). The Court certifies pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3) that any appeal from the order 
would not be taken in good faith, and therefore in forma pauperis status is denied for the purpose

                                                OPINION AND ORDER 
WILLIAM F. KEYSER, 
                        Respondent. 

NELSON S. ROMAN, United States District Judge: 
     Petitioner Angel Diaz (“Petitioner”), proceeding pro se, commenced this petition for a 
writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 seeking immediate release from state custody 
in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. He claims that his continued incarceration violates his rights 
to due process and endangers his health, life, and liberty in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, 
and Fourteenth Amendments. (“Petition,” ECF No. 2.) Respondent William F. Keyser 
(“Respondent”), Superintendent of the Sullivan Correctional Facility in Sullivan County, New 
York (hereinafter “Sullivan CF’), opposes the Petition, contending that Petitioner’s claim is not 
cognizable on habeas review, and that even if cognizable, it still fails on the merits. (“Response 
in Opposition to Petition,” ECF No. 28.) 
     Presently before the Court is the Report and Recommendation (“R&R”) of United States 
Magistrate Judge Paul E. Davison (“MJ Davison”), dated February 17, 2022, recommending that 
Petitioner’s habeas corpus petition under § 2254 be dismissed. (R&R, ECF No. 34.) Petitioner 
filed objections to MJ Davison’s R&R. (“Objections to the R&R,” ECF Nos. 35 & 36.) For the 
following reasons, the Court ADOPTS the R&R and DISMISSES the Petition. 

                         BACKGROUND                                      
I.   Factual Background                                                   
    Petitioner was convicted after a jury trial in New York Supreme Court, Bronx County, on 
August 15, 1990, of two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of first-degree robbery, and 

lesser related counts. (R&R at 2.) He was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of 38 years to 
life, which he is currently serving as an inmate in the custody of the New York State Department 
of Corrections and Community Supervision (“DOCCS”) at Sullivan CF. (Id.)  
    Petitioner alleges that Sullivan CF reported having 16 inmates infected with COVID-19 
on May 20, 2020, and 23 on June 16, 2020. (Pet. at 1.) Petitioner alleges that being incarcerated 
at Sullivan CF places him at a significant risk of danger due to his compromised immune system 
and medical conditions of high blood pressure and morbid obesity. (Id. at 2.) He asserts that the 
conditions of incarceration at Sullivan CF, the prohibition on wearing personal protective 
equipment, the closeness of inmate cells, and the fact that there is no way to enforce adequate 
social distancing, all make it impossible to control the spread of the virus. (Id. at 3.) He also 

asserts that “DOCCS has no plan to protect medically vulnerable inmates, who are at a 
heightened risk if they become infected” and that “DOCCS’ cleaning and disinfecting protocols 
are inadequate and fall short of all the CDC guidelines and recommendations, and not enough 
cleaning supplies are made available.” (Id. at 5.) Petitioner alleges that his continued detention at 
the facility puts him at a “very high risk” of contracting the virus, suffering severe complications, 
and perhaps even dying from it. (Id.)                                     
II.  Procedural Background                                                
 A.  Petitioner Files the Instant Petition                               
    On July 14, 2020, Petitioner filed the instant Petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. (ECF No. 
2.) Liberally construing his Petition, Petitioner seeks immediate release from prison, contending 
that his continued incarceration during the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes cruel and unusual 
punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Specifically, he alleges that Respondent has 
demonstrated “deliberate indifference” in his response to COVID-19 due to the ineffectiveness 

of the conditions of confinement at Sullivan CF. (Id. at 1–15.)           
    On October 23, 2020, Respondent filed his first motion to dismiss. (“Motion to Dismiss,” 
ECF No. 9.) Therein, Respondent argued that the Petition should be dismissed because 
Petitioner’s claim is not cognizable in habeas, and because he also failed to exhaust his state 
proceedings. (ECF No. 10 at 6–19.) On October 30, 2020, Petitioner requested the court to stay 
his Petition for 90 days so that he could exhaust his claim before the state court. (ECF No. 11.) 
On November 18, 2020, the Court granted Petitioner's request to stay the action and denied 
Respondent’s motion to dismiss without prejudice. (ECF No. 13.) On March 15, 2021, the Court 
referred the instant action to MJ Davison. (ECF No. 14.)                  
    On September 16, 2021, after the New York Court of Appeals denied Petitioner’s motion 

for leave to appeal, Petitioner filed a request to reopen the instant action, which the Court 
granted. (ECF Nos. 16 & 17.) On September 21, 2021, MJ Davison ordered Respondent to 
respond to the Petition within thirty days. (ECF No. 18.) Petitioner subsequently filed an 
application for appointment of counsel under 18 U.S.C. § 3006(A) and for an evidentiary 
hearing. (ECF Nos. 19, 31, & 32.) On November 22, 2021, Respondent filed his response in 
opposition to the Petition, arguing that Petitioner’s claim was not cognizable in habeas, and that 
even if the Court were to decide the matter on the merits, Petitioner had not demonstrated 
entitlement to the relief requested. (Resp. in Opp’n at 12–33.)           
 B.  The Magistrate Judge’s R&R                                          
    On February 17, 2022, MJ Davison issued an R&R recommending this Court to deny the 
Petition. (R&R at 1.) MJ Davison determined that the Petitioner’s claim is not cognizable in 
habeas and that it must be brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. While acknowledging that courts 

within this Circuit are divided on the question of whether a § 2254 habeas petition or a § 1983 
action is the appropriate vehicle for inmates to raise a claim regarding their conditions of 
confinement in light of COVID-19, MJ Davison, relying on Acevedo v. Capra, 545 F. Supp. 3d 
107 (S.D.N.Y. 2021), held that “when a prisoner challenges the conditions of his confinement, he 
must do so in an action under . . . § 1983.” (R&R at 6–7 (citing Acevedo, 545 F. Supp. 3d at 118)); 
see also Fielding v. LeFevre, 548 F.2d 1102, 209–10 (2d Cir. 1977) (same). In a separate order, MJ 
Davison denied Petitioner’s requests for appointment of counsel and for an evidentiary hearing. 
(ECF No. 33.)                                                             
    On February 23, 2022, Petitioner timely filed an objection to the R&R, in which he appears 
to object to the R&R solely on the basis that Acevedo is currently on appeal before the Second 

Circuit. (See ECF No. 35.) On May 19, 2022, Petitioner filed a supplemental objection to the R&R, 
without prior leave of the court, arguing that Johnson v. Allison, No. 2:21-CV-0828 KJN P, 2022 
WL 1444409 (E.D. Cal. May 6, 2022) purportedly supports his position that his claim is 
cognizable under habeas. (See ECF No. 36.)                                
                      STANDARD OF REVIEW                                 
I.   District Court’s Review of a Magistrate Judge’s R&R                  
    A magistrate judge may “hear a pretrial matter [that is] dispositive of a claim or defense” if 
so designated by a district court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B). In such a case, 
the magistrate judge “must enter a recommended disposition, including, if appropriate, proposed 
findings of fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(1); 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). Under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b), after a 
magistrate judge issues an R&R, “[w]ithin fourteen days after being served with a copy, any party 
may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided 
by rules of court.” See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2), (3).               

    “To accept the report and recommendation of a magistrate, to which no timely objection 
has been made, a district court need only satisfy itself that there is no clear error on the face of the 
record.” Wilds v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 262 F. Supp. 2d 163, 169 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) 
(quoting Nelson v. Smith, 618 F. Supp. 1186, 1189 (S.D.N.Y. 1985)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted); accord Feehan v. Feehan, No. 09-CV-7016(DAB), 2011 WL 497776, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 
Feb. 10, 2011); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 72 advisory committee note (1983 Addition, Subdivision 
(b)) (“When no timely objection is filed, the court need only satisfy itself that there is no clear error 
on the face of the record in order to accept the recommendation.”).       
    However, when a specific objection is made to the R&R, those objections must be 
reviewed de novo. 28 U.S.C. 636(b)(l); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); United States v. Male Juvenile, 121 

F.3d 34, 38 (2d Cir. 1997). In de novo review, a district court must consider the “[r]eport, the 
record, applicable legal authorities, along with Plaintiff’s and Defendant'’ objections and 
replies.” Diaz v. Girdich, No. 04-cv-5061, 2007 WL 187677, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2007) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). But to the extent “a petition makes only general and 
conclusory objections . . . or simply reiterates the original arguments, the district court will 
review the report and recommendations strictly for clear error.” Harris v. Burge, No. 04-cv-
5066, 2008 WL 772568, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2008).                     
    Lastly, when a petitioner is pro se, the court will read his or her “supporting papers 
liberally” and “interpret them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.” Ortiz v. 
Barkley, 558 F. Supp. 2d 444, 451 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting Burgos v. Hopkins, 14 F.3d 787, 
790 (2d Cir. 1994)). Nevertheless, a pro se petitioner’s objections must be “specific and clearly 
aimed at particular findings in the R&R, such that no party be allowed a ‘second bite at the 
apple’ by simply relitigating a prior argument.” Pinkney v. Progressive Home Health Servs., No. 

06 Civ. 5023 (LTS) (JCF), 2008 WL 2811816, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 2008).  
                          DISCUSSION                                     
    By his first objection, Petitioner seems to challenge the R&R’s determination solely on the 
basis that Acevedo is currently on appeal before the Second Circuit. (See ECF No. 35.) In his 
second objection, though untimely, Petitioner appears to argue that Johnson purportedly supports 
his position that his claim is cognizable under habeas. (See ECF No. 36.) Liberally construing his 
objections together, the Court undertakes de novo review to the extent that Petitioner is specifically 
objecting to the R&R based on its reliance on Acevedo and on Johnson’s applicability.  
 I.   28 U.S.C. § 2254 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983                              
    As a threshold matter, the Court discusses the differences between the two relevant statutes 

and their purpose. A state prisoner seeking relief from his imprisonment has “two main avenues” 
in federal court: a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 and a complaint under 42 
U.S.C. § 1983. Muhammad v. Close, 540 U.S. 749, 750 (2004) (per curiam).  
    State prisoners can challenge the validity of their confinement or particulars affecting its 
duration by filing a writ for habeas corpus under § 2254. Id. The writ may issue “only on the 
ground that [the prisoner] is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the 
United States.” Shinn v. Ramirez, 142 S. Ct. 1718, 1730 (2022) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254). That is 
because “the purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state convictions comply with the 
federal law in existence at the time the conviction became final, and not to provide a mechanism 
for the continuing reexamination of final judgments based upon later emerging legal doctrine.” 
Sawyer v. Smith 497 U.S. 227, 234 (1990).                                 
    For that reason, before a state prisoner may seek federal habeas relief, he must first either 
exhaust his remedies available in state court or establish an adequate excuse for his procedurally 

defaulted claims—that is, those claims that were not presented to the state court consistent with its 
own procedural rules. See Shinn, 142 S. Ct. at 1732. “Together, exhaustion and procedural default 
promote federal-state comity . . . [by affording] States an initial opportunity to pass upon and 
correct alleged violations of prisoners’ federal rights, . . . and protect [] against the significant harm 
to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect [their] procedural rules . . . .” 
Id. (alterations in original).                                            
    By contrast, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a state prisoner may request relief based on the 
circumstances of confinement. See Muhammad, 540 U.S. at 750. Section 1983 provides a civil 
claim for damages against any person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another of any 
rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or the laws of the United States. See 

42 U.S.C. § 1983; see also Cornejo v. Bell, 592 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir. 2010). “The ‘central 
objective of [§ 1983] . . . is to ensure that individuals whose federal constitutional or statutory 
rights are abridged may recover damages or secure injunctive relief.” Dufort v. City of New York, 
874 F.3d 338, 355 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Felder v. Casey, 487 U.S. 131, 139 (1988) (alterations 
in original). However, the United States Supreme Court has expressly held that “[r]elease from 
custody is not an available remedy under [§ 1983].” Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 479 
(1973); see also Jenkins v. Haubert, 179 F.3d 19, 23 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[W]here the fact or duration 
of a prisoner’s confinement is at issue, § 1983 is unavailable, and only § 2254(b) with its 
exhaustion requirement may be employed.”).                                
    Here, MJ Davison liberally construed the Petition to contend that Respondent “failed to 
implement procedures that would ensure the safety of the prisoners at Sullivan [CF] in light of 
COVID.” (R&R at 5.) After reviewing the Petition, the Court agrees with MJ Davison. While 
Petitioner seeks to be released from incarceration as relief, the entirety of the Petition focuses on 

the alleged unsafe conditions of confinement due to impact of COVID-19 at Sullivan CF. Nowhere 
does the Petition contain any allegations challenging the validity of Petitioner’s state conviction. 
(See generally Pet., ECF No. 2.)                                          
    Therefore, as Petitioner is evidently not challenging the validity of his state conviction—
that is, alleging that his state conviction was obtained as a result of failing to comply with or 
inconsistent with federal law—and is instead requesting relief based on the circumstances of his 
detention, then Petitioner’s claim is not cognizable in habeas and must be brought instead under § 
1983. Accordingly, the Court agrees with MJ Davison’s conclusion in his R&R relying on Acevedo 
that “when a prisoner challenges the conditions of his confinement, he must do so in an action 
under . . . § 1983.” (R&R at 6–7 (citing Acevedo, 545 F. Supp. 3d at 118).) 

    Further, Petitioner’s reliance on Johnson to support his contention that his claim is 
cognizable in habeas is misplaced. In Johnson, a state prisoner who was at a medically high risk of 
death if he contracted COVID-19, filed an action under § 1983 alleging that the defendants 
violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment for failing to 
protect him from the virus. See Johnson, 2022 WL 1444409, at *1. As relief, the state prisoner 
sought declaratory relief, punitive damages, and early release from prison. Id. at *1, *6. In relevant 
part, the court held that the state prisoner could not obtain release from prison through his § 1983 
action and that he could only obtain release through habeas. Id. at *6. Nowhere in its opinion did 
the court hold, much less suggest, that a state prisoner could state a cognizable habeas claim for an 
Eighth Amendment violation based on the impact of COVID-19 on his circumstances of 
confinement—such as Petitioner attempts here.                             
    As previously discussed, a claim is cognizable in habeas when it seeks to challenge the 
validity of a state prisoner’s confinement or duration of confinement “[that] is in violation of the 

Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” Shinn, 142 S. Ct. at 1730 (quoting 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2254). But here, Petitioner’s allegations focus on complaints about the circumstances and 
conditions of his confinement by alleging that Respondent “failed to implement procedures that 
would ensure the safety of the prisoners at Sullivan [CF] in light of COVID.” (R&R at 5.) And to 
the extent Petitioner seeks judicial relief other than release from custody based on these allegations, 
he may properly do so through a civil action under § 1983. See Preiser, 411 U.S. at 479. 
    Indeed, if the Court were to hypothetically rule in favor of Petitioner and assume his claim 
to be meritorious, the validity of any state court conviction or sentence—regardless of duration and 
severity—could potentially be overturned by a collateral attack in federal courts based solely on 
the impact of COVID-19 on an inmate’s conditions of confinement. Such an outcome would not 

only run afoul of decades of well-established United States Supreme Court precedent but would 
also utterly disregard federal-state comity.                              
                          CONCLUSION                                     
    For the foregoing reasons, the Court ADOPTS MJ Davison’s R&R in its entirety, 
OVERRULES Petitioner’s objections, and DISMISSES the Petition. The Clerk of Court is 
respectfully directed to enter judgment, and accordingly, to terminate the Petition (ECF No. 2), to 
mail a copy of this opinion to Petitioner at his last known address, and to show proof of service on 
the docket.                                                               
    Further, as Petitioner has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional 
right, the Court will not issue a certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); Love v. 
McCray, 413 F3d 192, 195 (2d Cir. 2005); Lozada v. United States, 107 F3d 1011, 1017 (2d Cir. 
1997), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Perez, 129 F3d 225, 259-60 (2d Cir. 1997). 
The Court certifies pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3) that any appeal from this order would not be 
taken in good faith, and therefore in forma pauperis status is denied for the purpose of an appeal. 
See Coppedge v. United States, 369 US 438, 444-45 (1962).

WILLIAM F. KEYSER.,, 
                       Respondent. 
PAUL E. DAVISON, U.S.MLJ.: 
     Before the Court are Petitioner Angel Diaz’s motions requesting appointment of counsel, 
and a hearing before this Court. [Dkts.19, 31, 32.]  For the reasons set forth below, Petitioner’s 
motions are denied. 
     Petitioner seeks a writ of habeas corpus, challenging his confinement in light of the 
ongoing COVID pandemic. [Dkt. 1.]  There is no constitutional right to representation by counsel 
in habeas corpus proceedings, as there is in most criminal proceedings.  See Green v. Abrams, 
984 F.2d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 1993).  Rather, applications for counsel in habeas corpus proceedings 
are addressed with the court’s discretion, but such applications should not be granted 
indiscriminately.  See Cooper v. Sargenti, 877 F.2d 170, 172 (2d Cir. 1989)). 
     In considering whether to appoint counsel for habeas petitioners, courts follow the 
standards set forth by the Second Circuit for the appointment of counsel to indigent civil litigants 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915.  id  Accordingly, the district court is directed to screen such 
applications first by evaluating whether the petition “seems likely to be of substance.”  Jd.  If the 
court concludes that the applicant’s claims meet this threshold requirement, then the court is to 
consider secondary criteria such as Petitioner’s ability to present the case (either by obtaining 
representation independently or with his own abilities), Petitioner’s ability to handle the case 

without assistance in light of the required factual investigation, the complexity of the legal issues, 
the need for expertly-conducted cross-examination to test veracity, and “any special reason in 
that case why appointment of counsel would be more likely to lead to a just determination.”  See 
id.  In particular, in the context of habeas corpus proceedings, courts look to whether an 
evidentiary hearing should be held in connection with the petition; where no hearing is to be 
held, the appointment of counsel is generally not warranted.  U.S. ex rel. Cadogan v. LaVallee, 
502 F.2d 824, 826 (2d Cir. 1974). 
     The Court has today filed a Report and Recommendation recommending that Petitioner’s 
Petition be denied.  In the event that the Report and Recommendation is adopted, no hearing is 
necessary.  Accordingly, the motions are denied as moot.  The Clerk is respectfully directed to 
terminate the motions (Dkts,19, 31, 32.).
