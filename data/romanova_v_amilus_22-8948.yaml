outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Jana Romanova''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiff argued that the district court erred in finding a basis in her complaint for the fair use defense, contending that the facts alleged did not support a finding of fair use for Defendant''s use of her photograph.

  2. Plaintiff contended that the district court erred procedurally by sua sponte raising a substantive, non-jurisdictional affirmative defense (fair use) on behalf of a non-appearing defendant, thereby improperly dismissing her complaint on grounds not asserted by Defendant.'
