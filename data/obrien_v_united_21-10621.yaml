outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Brad O''Brien, Personal Representative of the Estate of Melissa Allen''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in holding that the regulation promulgated by the Secretary (42 C.F.R. § 6.6(e)(4)) did not violate the Public Health Service Act''s statutory scheme, contending that automatic or ''blanket'' pre-deeming of coverage for non-patient services without individualized application or review exceeded the Secretary''s authority.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in finding that deeming extended to Dr. Roca''s treatment of Allen, arguing that Dr. Roca''s employment contract did not require him to provide emergency room coverage to non-health center patients and that no documentation or particularized application was submitted to extend coverage to Allen''s care.

  3. Appellant argued that the time to file his Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) claim did not begin accruing until he first spoke to his lawyer in September 2017, asserting that the factual basis for the cause of action was not reasonably knowable until that time due to the natural causes listed on the death certificate and lack of specialized medical knowledge.

  4. Appellant contended that, even if his claim accrued before he spoke with his lawyer, the FTCA''s Savings Clause should save his claim because he presented the claim to the appropriate federal agency within sixty days after dismissal of the state court action.'
