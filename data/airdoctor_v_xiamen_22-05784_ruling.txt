 1        This matter came before the Court on the motion by Plaintiff AIRDOCTOR, LLC
 2 (hereafter “Plaintiff” or “AirDoctor”) for entry of default judgment against Defendant
 3 XIAMEN QICHUANG TRADE CO., LTD. (hereafter “Defendant(s)”). The Court,
 4 having reviewed the motion, all papers in support and opposition, and good cause
 5 appearing therefor, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED as follows:
 6        1.     This case is a civil action arising under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125.
 7        2.     This Court has jurisdiction over these claims under 15 U.S.C. § 1121, and
 8 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1367(a).
 9        3.     Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2).
10        4.     Plaintiff AirDoctor, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its
11 principal place of business in Sherman Oaks, California.
12        5.     Defendant is a foreign individuals/entity located in China.
13        6.     AirDoctor is the owner of federal trademark registrations covering its
14 AIRDOCTOR1 and ULTRAHEPA trademarks. Plaintiff AirDoctor owns U.S.
15 Trademark Reg. No. 5177385 for AIRDOCTOR in Class 11 (“AIRDOCTOR
16 Registration” and “AIRDOCTOR Mark”, respectively) and U.S. Trademark Reg. No.
17 6300545 for ULTRAHEPA in Class 11 (“ULTRAHEPA Registration” and
18 “ULTRAHEPA Mark”, respectively).
19        7.     Defendant operates the storefront, “Replacement Filter” where it sells the
20 substandard, imitation replacement filters under the “FCFMY” brand (the “Substandard
21 Filters”) on Amazon.com. Dkt. No. 1, Compl. at ¶¶42-43. On Amazon.com, Defendant
22 advertises that its Products are “HEPA” grade, are “compatible” with Plaintiff’s
23 AirDoctor Air Purifiers, “remove 99.97% of airborne particles down to 0.3 microns in
24 size” and “fit snugly” in the AirDoctor Air Purifier. Dkt. No. 1 at ¶¶44-47, Exs. H-I.
25        8.     In its advertising and packaging of the Substandard Filters, Defendant
26 conveys the message to consumers that its Substandard Filters meet the HEPA standard
27
     1Unless otherwise noted, the Capitalized terms herein shall have the meaning
28 assigned to them in the Complaint (Dkt. No. 1).
                                               -1-             CASE NO. 2:22-cv-05784-GW(ASx)
                            [PROPOSED] FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDER
  Case 2:22-cv-05784-GW-AS Document 64 Filed 12/12/23 Page 3 of 8 Page ID #:560




 1 to trap 99.97% of airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns. Id. at ¶¶48-49. Moreover,
 2 by claiming its Substandard Filters are “compatible” and “fit” AirDoctor units, Defendant
 3 indicates that its Substandard Filters perform just as Plaintiff’s AirDoctor UltraHEPA
 4 Filters do within the AirDoctor Air Purifiers, and that they properly fit in the AirDoctor
 5 Air Purifiers to maintain a sealed system. Id. at 49.
 6        9.     Third-party laboratory testing of the Substandard Filters showed that the
 7 Substandard Filters do not meet the meet the minimum HEPA standard to filter 99.97%
 8 of particles as small as 0.3 microns when used in the AirDoctor Air Purifiers and that the
 9 Substandard Filters fail to meet the performance and efficiency of genuine AirDoctor
10 UltraHEPA filters.
11        10.    The Substandard Filters are not “compatible” or         “fit” AirDoctor Air
12 Purifiers because the Substandard Filters use frames made from paper and foam which do
13 not form a proper seal in the AirDoctor Air Purifier unit and, thereby, allow unfiltered air
14 to pass directly between the frame and filter materials which significantly reduces the
15 performance of the Substandard Filters and the AirDoctor Air Purifiers, and do not filter
16 air in a “compatible”/equivalent manner to genuine AirDoctor UltraHEPA filters.
17        11.    The industry-standard, third-party product research firm Helium-10, reports
18 that from December 2021 through June 2023, Defendant has sold 43,863 units of the
19 Substandard Filters.
20        12.    On April 18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s application for an order
21 authorizing alternative service of process. Dkt. 27.
22        13.    In accordance with the Court’s order, Plaintiff served the summons and
23 complaint on Defendant, but Defendant has not responded to the Complaint or otherwise
24 appeared or participated in this action. See Dkt. 32, 35.
25        14.    Because Defendant failed to appear or otherwise file a responsive pleading
26 to the Complaint, Plaintiff requested entry of default on June 21, 2023. Dkt. 35. The
27 Clerk entered Defendant’s default on June 22, 2023. Dkt. 36.

                                                -2-             CASE NO. 2:22-cv-05784-GW(ASx)

 1        15.    Defendant is not a minor, infant, or otherwise incompetent person, and the
 2 Servicemembers Civil Relief Act does not apply. Id.
 3        16.    Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b)(2), because Defendant has not
 4 appeared in these proceedings, notice of default judgment proceedings is not required.
 5        17.    Because Defendant failed to appear or otherwise file a responsive pleading
 6 to the Complaint, Plaintiff requested entry of default on June 21, 2023. Dkt. 35. The
 7 Clerk entered Defendant’s default on June 22, 2023. Dkt. 36.
 8        18.    For the reasons stated by the Court in: (1) the Court’s September 5, 2023
 9 Tentative Ruling on Plaintiff's Motion For Entry of Default Judgment Against Defendant
10 (Dkt. 43); (2) the Court’s October 13, 2023 Revised Further Consideration of Plaintiff's
11 Motion For Entry Of Default Judgment Against Defendant Following Supplemental
12 Briefing (Dkt. 50); (3) the Court’s September 7, 2023 hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for
13 Entry of Default Judgment Against Defendant (Dkt. 45); (4) the Court’s October 16, 2023
14 hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry of Default Judgment Against Defendant (Dkt. 53)
15 and (5) the Court’s November 20, 2023 hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry of Default
16 Judgment Against Defendant (Dkt. 56), Plaintiff’s request for damages under the Lanham
17 Act in the form of sales of its own AirDoctor UltraHEPA Filters and/ or Defendant’s
18 revenues on its sales of the Substandard Filters is denied.
19        19.    While this Court finds that this case is “exceptional” under the Lanham Act,
20 because an award of attorneys’ fees set forth in Local Rule 55-3 is based on the damages
21 awarded, and no damages can be awarded pursuant to Fed R. Civ P. 54(c), Plaintiff’s
22 request for attorney’s fees is likewise denied.
23        20.    The Court grants Plaintiff’s request for a permanent injunction (“Permanent
24 Injunction”) as follows:
25        21.    Defendants,    including   any      employees,   agents,   servants,   officers,
