Dear Judge Kaplan:                                        [pate FILED:  ORla)/2S 
   The parties write to provide a status update. On June 30, 2023, □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□ 
pending resolution of Defendants’ appeals of the Court’s order denying Defendants’ motion to 
compel arbitration. Dkt. No.  126.  On March 13, 2025, the Second Circuit issued an opinion 
affirming in part and reversing in part, Dkt. No. 130, holding that an arbitrator needed to decide 
whether Plaintiffs’ claims against Uber were subject to arbitration, but that “Grubhub’s arbitration 
clause does not apply to Plaintiffs’ antitrust claims against Grubhub.” /d. at 3-4. 
   On April 4, 2025, the Second Circuit issued the mandate, Dkt. No. 131, remanding for this 
Court  “to  adjudicate  the  merits  of the  complaint  with  respect  to  Grubhub  and  for  further 
proceedings consistent with [its] opinion.” Jd. at 1. The parties have met and conferred but have 
been unable to agree upon a proposed schedule to move the case forward. The parties’ positions 
are set forth below. 
   Plaintiffs’ position: The Court lift the stay and permit discovery to resume. The parties 
sought the stay for two reasons. First, under Coinbase, Inc. v. Bielski, 599 U.S. 736 (2023), the 
stay was required “with respect to the five named plaintiffs subject to both Defendants’ 9 U.S.C. 
§ 16(a)  appeals.”  Dkt.  No.  125  at  1.  Second,  although  two  named  plaintiffs  (Drewey  and 
Bensimon) were not subject to both appeals, those plaintiffs could not represent “one of the three 
proposed classes”—namely, the class asserting claims in connection with their purchases through 
non-Defendant platforms, like Doordash. fd. As a result, in the parties’ view, moving forward 
before the appeals were resolved “posed many risks,” including “duplicative and inefficient” 
discovery and “multiple rounds of class certification proceedings.” Jd, 
  Neither of these issues is present now. The resolution of Defendants’ appeals means that 
Coinbase no  longer applies.  In  addition, none  of the named plaintiffs’  claims is  subject to 
arbitration with Grubhub, and although five named plaintiffs’ claims may be subject to arbitration 
with Uber,! the remaining two plaintiffs can represent each of the three classes asserting claims 
against Uber. Accordingly, the concerns that the parties expressed two years ago regarding judicial 
economy  no  longer  apply.  Indeed,  the  parties  presupposed  that  the  stay  would  end  when 

|  Plaintiffs view Uber’s argument that Plaintiffs’ claims are arbitrable as meritless, including 
because it is inconsistent and irreconcilable with this Court’s order denying Uber’s motion to 
compel arbitration and the Second Circuit’s order holding that Plaintiffs’ identical claims against 
Grubhub are not subject to arbitration.

         The stay of this acting pending appeal (Dkt 126) is lifted.  Plaintiffs shall file an 
amended complaint by September 30, 2025.  Fact discovery shall be completed by December 16,

                              Dated: June 30, 2023 
Re:  = Mariam Davitashvili, et al. v. Grubhub Inc., et al., 20 Civ. 03000 (LAK) (S.D.N.Y.) 
Dear Judge Kaplan, 
      We write jointly on behalf of the Plaintiffs and Defendants. Under Your Honor’s Rules of 
Practice and Section 13.1 of this Court’s ECF Rules and Instructions, we respectfully submit this 
joint letter motion based on last Friday’s Supreme Court decision in Coinbase v. Bielski, No. 22- 
105 (June 23, 2023), a copy of which is attached. In light of Coinbase, the parties request that the 
Court stay all proceedings until Defendants’ pending interlocutory appeals under 9 U.S.C. § 16(a) 
are resolved. See Davitashvili v. Grubhub Inc., Nos. 23-521(L), 23-522(Con) (2d Cir.). 
      According to the Supreme Court in Coinbase, a “district court must stay its pre-trial and 
trial proceedings while [an] interlocutory appeal” under “9 U.S. C. §16(a) ... is ongoing.” Slip op. 
at 1 (abrogating Motorola Credit Corp. v.  Uzan, 388 F. 3d 39, 53-54 (2d Cir. 2004)). The Court 
explained that “[a]n appeal, including an interlocutory appeal,  ‘divests the district court of its 
control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” /d. at 3 (quoting Griggs v. Provident 
Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (1982)). The Court in Coinbase also held that when a 
party appeals under 9 U.S.C. § 16(a), “the entire case is essentially ‘involved in the appeal.’” □□□ 
(quoting Griggs, 459 U.S. at 58). 
      Accordingly, Coinbase requires that this Court stay all proceedings with respect to the five 
named plaintiffs subject to both Defendants’ 9 U.S.C. § 16(a) appeals. And since all plaintiffs in 
this case assert the same allegations in support of the same claims, and since there 1s no plaintiff 
not subject to either appeal who can seek to represent one of the three proposed classes, going 
forward without  all plaintiffs  for  all  of the putative  classes poses  many risks.  They  include 
duplicative and inefficient party, third-party, and expert discovery and multiple rounds of class 
certification proceedings, all “wast[ing] scarce judicial resources.” Coinbase, slip op. at 6. Under 
these circumstances, “the interests of justice [and] judicial economy thus would be served” by a 
complete “stay [of] proceedings.” Freeman v. Complex Computing Co., 931 F. Supp. 1115, 1124 
(S.D.N.Y. 1996) (Kaplan, J.), aff'd in relevant part, rev’d in part on other grounds and remanded, 
119 F.3d 1044 (2d Cir. 1997). 
      For the foregoing reasons, the parties request that this Court stay all proceedings in this 
case until Defendants’ pending interlocutory appeals under 9 U.S.C. §16(a) are resolved and the 
Second Circuit issues the mandates to this Court. (The parties have also agreed to work to expedite 
resolution of Defendants’ appeals.) If the Court grants this motion, the parties will provide the 
Court with a proposed scheduling order within twenty-one days after the issuance of the mandates.

Sincerely,

             THE NINTH CIRCUIT                               
 No. 22–105.  Argued March 21, 2023—Decided June 23, 2023    
Abraham Bielski filed a putative class action on behalf of Coinbase users
alleging that Coinbase, an online currency platform, failed to replace
funds fraudulently taken from the users’ accounts.  Because Coinbase’s 
User Agreement provides for dispute resolution through binding arbi-
tration, Coinbase filed a motion to compel arbitration.  The District 
Court denied the motion. Coinbase then filed an interlocutory appeal
to the Ninth Circuit under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. 
§16(a), which authorizes an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a
motion to compel arbitration.  Coinbase also moved the District Court
to stay its proceedings pending resolution of the interlocutory appeal.
The District Court denied Coinbase’s stay motion, and the Ninth Cir-
cuit likewise declined to stay the District Court’s proceedings pending
appeal.                                                      
Held: A district court must stay its proceedings while an interlocutory 
appeal on the question of arbitrability is ongoing.  Pp. 2–10.
 (a)Section 16(a) does not say whether district court proceedings
must be stayed pending resolution of an interlocutory appeal.  But 
Congress enacted the provision against a clear background principle 
prescribed by this Court’s precedents:  An appeal, including an inter-
locutory appeal, “divests the district court of its control over those as-
pects of the case involved in the appeal.”  Griggs v. Provident Consumer 
Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58.  The Griggs principle resolves this case.
Because the question on appeal is whether the case belongs in arbitra-
tion or instead in the district court, the entire case is essentially “in-
volved in the appeal,” id., at 58, and Griggs dictates that the district 
court stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrabil-
ity is ongoing.  Most courts of appeals to address this question, as well
as leading treatises, agree with that conclusion.            
2           COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
                 Syllabus                                    
 The common practice of staying district court proceedings during the
pendency of an interlocutory appeal taken under §16(a) reflects com-
mon sense.  If the district court could move forward with pre-trial and
trial proceedings while the appeal on arbitrability was ongoing, then 
many of the asserted benefits of arbitration (efficiency, less expense,
less intrusive discovery, and the like) would be irretrievably lost—even
if the court of appeals later concluded that the case actually had be-
longed in arbitration all along.  Absent a stay, parties also could be 
forced to settle to avoid the district court proceedings (including dis-
covery and trial) that they contracted to avoid through arbitration. 
The Griggs rule avoids these detrimental results.            
 Congress’s longstanding practice reflects the Griggs rule.  Given 
Griggs, when Congress wants to authorize an interlocutory appeal and
to automatically stay the district court proceedings during that appeal, 
Congress ordinarily need not say anything about a stay.  By contrast, 
when Congress wants to authorize an interlocutory appeal, but not to 
automatically stay district court proceedings pending that appeal, 
Congress typically says so.  Since the creation of the modern courts of 
appeals system in 1891, Congress has enacted multiple statutory “non-
stay” provisions.  Pp. 2–7.                                  
 (b) Bielski’s arguments to overcome the Griggs principle are unper-
suasive.  First, the courts of appeals possess robust tools to prevent 
unwarranted delay and deter frivolous interlocutory appeals that an
automatic stay might otherwise encourage. Second, Congress included 
explicit stay requirements in two other statutory provisions for rea-
sons particular to those statutes, not because Congress thought that 
an interlocutory appeal did not ordinarily stay district court proceed-
ings. Third, the result here does not create a special, arbitration-pre-
ferring procedural rule, but simply subjects arbitrability appeals to the 
same stay principles that courts apply in other analogous contexts
where an interlocutory appeal is authorized.  Fourth, experience shows 
that ordinary discretionary stay factors would not adequately protect 
parties’ rights to an interlocutory appellate determination of arbitra-
bility.  In any event, the background Griggs rule applies regardless of 
how often courts might otherwise grant stays under the ordinary dis-
cretionary stay factors.  Fifth, while the Court has recognized that 
questions of arbitrability are severable from merits questions, the sole
issue here is whether the district court’s authority to consider a case is 
“involved in the appeal” when an appellate court considers the thresh-
old question of arbitrability, Griggs, 459 U. S., at 58.  The answer is 
yes.  Pp. 7–10.

COINBASE, INC., PETITIONER v. ABRAHAM BIELSKI 
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
          APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT 
                  [June 23, 2023] 
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH delivered the opinion of the Court. 
When a  federal district court denies a motion to compel 
arbitration,  the  losing party has  a  statutory right to  an 
interlocutory  appeal.   See  9  U.S.C.  §16(a).   The  sole 
question here is whether the district court must stay its 
pre-trial  and  trial  proceedings  while  the  interlocutory 
appeal is ongoing.  The answer is yes:  The district court 
must stay its proceedings.
 Coinbase operates an online platform on which users can 
buy  and  sell  eryptocurrencies  and  government-issued 
currencies.  When creating a Coinbase account, individuals 
agree  to  the  terms  in  Coinbase’s  User  Agreement.   As 
relevant here, the User Agreement contains an arbitration 
provision,  which  directs  that  disputes  arising under  the 
agreement be resolved through binding arbitration. 
This case concerns a putative class action filed against 
Coinbase  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  Northern 
District of California.  Abraham Bielski sued on behalf of 
Coinbase users who allege that Coinbase failed to replace 
funds fraudulently taken from the users’ accounts. 
The District Court denied Coinbase’s motion to compel

             Opinion of the Court                            
arbitration.  Coinbase then filed an interlocutory appeal to  
the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit under 9      
U. S. C. §16(a).1  Section 16(a) authorizes an interlocutory  
appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration.     
Coinbase also moved to stay District Court proceedings       
pending resolution of the arbitrability issue on appeal.  The 
District  Court  declined  to  stay  its  proceedings.  After 
receiving Coinbase’s motion for a stay, the Ninth Circuit     
likewise declined to stay the District Court’s proceedings.   
The Ninth Circuit followed its precedent, under which an      
appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration      
does not automatically stay district court proceedings.  See  
Britton v. Co-op Banking Group, 916 F.  2d 1405, 1412         
(1990). By contrast, however, most other Courts of Appeals    
to address the question have held that a district court must  
stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on the    
question of arbitrability is ongoing.  E.g., Bradford-Scott   
Data Corp. v. Physician Computer Network, Inc., 128 F. 3d     
504, 506 (CA7 1997).                                          
To  resolve  that  disagreement  among  the  Courts  of      
Appeals, we granted certiorari.  598 U. S. ___ (2022).        
                   II

agreements.  In  1988,  Congress  passed  and  President      
Reagan signed an amendment to the Act; the amendment          
is  codified  at  9  U. S. C.  §16(a).    Under  §16(a),  when  a

             Opinion of the Court                            
district court denies a party’s motion to compel arbitration, 
that party may take an interlocutory appeal.  Section 16(a)   
creates a rare statutory exception to the usual rule that     
parties may not appeal before final judgment.  See Mohawk     
Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U. S. 100, 108–109 (2009). 
Notably,  Congress  provided  for  immediate  interlocutory   
appeals of orders denying—but not of orders granting—         
motions to compel arbitration.                                
The sole question before this Court is whether a district    
court  must  stay  its  proceedings  while  the  interlocutory
appeal on arbitrability is ongoing.  The answer is yes.       
Section 16(a) does not say whether the district  court       
proceedings must be stayed.  But Congress enacted §16(a)      
against a clear background principle prescribed by this       
Court’s precedents:  An appeal, including an interlocutory    
appeal, “divests the district court of its control over those 
aspects  of  the  case  involved  in  the  appeal.”  Griggs  v. 
Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982).     
That  Griggs  principle  reflects  a  longstanding  tenet  of 
American procedure.  See Hovey v. McDonald, 109 U. S.         
150, 157 (1883); see also Price v. Dunn, 587 U. S. ___, ___   
(2019) (THOMAS, J., joined by ALITO and GORSUCH, JJ.,         
concurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 7) (describing 
Griggs principle as “well settled”); Marrese v. American      
Academy  of  Orthopaedic  Surgeons,  470  U. S.  373,  379    
(1985)  (“In  general,  filing  of  a  notice  of  appeal  confers
jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district 
court of control over those aspects of the case involved in   
the appeal”).                                                 
The Griggs principle resolves this case.  Because the        
question  on  appeal  is  whether  the  case  belongs  in     
arbitration or instead in the district court, the entire case 
is essentially “involved in the appeal.”  459 U. S., at 58. As 
Judge  Easterbrook  cogently  explained,  when  a  party      
appeals  the  denial  of  a  motion  to  compel  arbitration, 
whether “the litigation may go forward in the district court  
4           COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
             Opinion of the Court                            
is  precisely  what  the  court  of  appeals  must  decide.”  
Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician Computer Network,      
Inc., 128 F. 3d 504, 506 (CA7 1997).  Stated otherwise, the   
question of whether “the case should be litigated in the      
district  court  . . .  is  the  mirror  image  of  the  question 
presented on appeal.”  Id., at 505.  Here, as elsewhere, it   
“makes no sense for trial to go forward while the court of    
appeals cogitates on whether there should be one.”  Apostol   
v. Gallion, 870 F. 2d 1335, 1338 (CA7 1989).  In short,       
Griggs  dictates  that  the  district  court  must  stay  its 
proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability   
is ongoing.2                                                  
Most courts of appeals to address the question in the        
§16(a) context have reached that same conclusion.  E.g.,      
Blinco v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 366 F. 3d 1249, 1253     
(CA11 2004) (“[I]t makes little sense for the litigation to   
continue in the district court while the appeal is pending”).3
Leading treatises agree that a district court should stay its 
proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability   
is ongoing. For example, Moore’s treatise states that a “stay 
in these circumstances” is “the sounder approach” and “is     
consistent with the general [Griggs] principle that a district
court should not exercise jurisdiction over those aspects of  
the case that are involved in the appeal.”  19 J. Moore, D.

Federal Practice §203.12[3][a] (3d ed. 2022).  Similarly, the 
Wright and Miller treatise endorses the automatic stay        
requirement in arbitration cases.  The treatise explains      
that a “complete stay of district-court proceedings pending   
appeal  from a  refusal to order arbitration is  desirable”   
because  “[c]ontinued  trial-court  proceedings  pending      
appeal could lead to an entirely wasted trial if arbitration  
is ordered on appeal.”  15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.        
Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3914.17, p. 7 (2d     
ed., Supp. 2022).  In the Circuits that have considered the   
issue in the analogous contexts of qualified immunity and     
double jeopardy, moreover, district courts likewise must      
automatically  stay  their  proceedings  while  the           
interlocutory  appeal  is  ongoing.4   Similarly,  as  Bielski
acknowledges, courts have held that the Griggs principle      
applies to those aspects of the case involved in a certified  
interlocutory appeal under 28 U. S. C. §1292(b).5             
The common practice in §16(a) cases, therefore, is for a     
district court to stay its proceedings while the interlocutory
appeal on arbitrability is ongoing.  That common practice     
reflects common sense. Absent an automatic stay of district   
court proceedings, Congress’s decision in §16(a) to afford a  
right to an interlocutory appeal would be largely nullified.

             Opinion of the Court                            
If the district court could move forward with pre-trial and   
trial  proceedings  while  the  appeal  on  arbitrability  was
ongoing, then many of the asserted benefits of arbitration    
(efficiency, less expense, less intrusive discovery, and the  
like)  would  be  irretrievably  lost—even  if  the  court  of 
appeals later concluded that the case actually had belonged   
in arbitration all along.  Absent a stay, parties also could be
forced  to  settle  to  avoid  the  district  court  proceedings
(including discovery and trial) that they contracted to avoid 
through  arbitration.    That  potential  for  coercion  is   
especially pronounced in class actions, where the possibility 
of colossal liability can lead to what Judge Friendly called  
“blackmail settlements.” H. Friendly, Federal Jurisdiction:   
A General View 120 (1973).                                    
As Judge Easterbrook stated, continuation of proceedings     
in the district court “largely defeats the point of the appeal.” 
Bradford-Scott, 128 F. 3d, at 505.  A right to interlocutory  
appeal of the arbitrability issue without an automatic stay   
of the district court proceedings is therefore like a lock    
without a key, a bat without a ball, a computer without a     
keyboard—in other words, not especially sensible.             
From the Judiciary’s institutional perspective, moreover,    
allowing a case to proceed simultaneously in the district     
court and the court of appeals creates the possibility that   
the  district  court  will  waste  scarce  judicial  resources—
which could be devoted to other pressing criminal or civil    
matters—on  a  dispute  that  will  ultimately  head  to      
arbitration in any event.  That scenario represents the       
“worst  possible  outcome”  for  parties  and  the  courts:   
litigating a dispute in the district court only for the court of
appeals to “reverse and order the dispute arbitrated.”  Id.,  
at 506.  The Griggs rule avoids that detrimental result.      
Importantly,  Congress’s  longstanding  practice  both       
reflects and reinforces the Griggs rule.  When Congress       
wants  to  authorize  an  interlocutory  appeal  and  to      
automatically stay the district court proceedings during      
           Cite as: 599 U. S. ____ (2023)  7                 
             Opinion of the Court                            
that appeal, Congress need not say anything about a stay.     
At least absent contrary indications, the background Griggs   
principle  already  requires  an  automatic  stay  of  district 
court proceedings that relate to any aspect  of the case      
involved in the appeal.  By contrast, when Congress wants     
to  authorize  an  interlocutory  appeal,  but  not  to       
automatically stay district court proceedings pending that    
appeal, Congress typically says so.  Since the creation of the 
modern courts of appeals system in 1891, Congress has         
enacted multiple statutory “non-stay” provisions.6  Indeed,   
Congress enacted a “non-stay” provision the day before        
enacting §16(a) in 1988.  See 102 Stat. 4120 (“Neither the    
application for, nor the granting of, an appeal . . . shall stay
proceedings in the Court of Veterans Appeals”).               
In short, the Griggs rule requires that a district court     
stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on the    
question of arbitrability is ongoing.

To overcome the Griggs principle, Bielski advances five      
main arguments.  None is persuasive.                          
First,  Bielski  contends  that  an  automatic  stay  would  
encourage frivolous appeals that would improperly delay       
district court proceedings.  To begin with, Bielski has not   
established that frivolous appeals frequently occur in the    
Circuits  that have  long  applied  the  Griggs  principle  in

arbitration cases.  Cf. Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White  
Sales, Inc., 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 8).  Nor does 
Bielski  argue  that  Coinbase’s  appeal  in  this  case  is  
frivolous.  Importantly, moreover, the courts of appeals      
possess  robust  tools  to  prevent  unwarranted  delay  and  
deter frivolous interlocutory appeals.  For example, a party  
can  ask  the  court  of  appeals  to  summarily  affirm,  to 
expedite  an  interlocutory  appeal,  or  to  dismiss  the    
interlocutory appeal as frivolous.  In addition, nearly every 
circuit has developed a process by which a district court     
itself may certify that an interlocutory appeal is frivolous. 
Brief for Petitioner 51; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v.      
Carlisle, 556 U. S. 624, 629 (2009) (“Appellate courts can    
streamline the disposition of meritless claims and even       
authorize the district court’s retention of ” a case “when an 
appeal is certified as frivolous”). Finally, a court of appeals
may impose sanctions where appropriate; the possibility of    
sanctions also helps deter frivolous appeals.  See Fed. Rule  
App. Proc. 38; Arthur Andersen, 556 U. S., at 629.            
Second, Bielski contrasts §16(a) with two other statutory    
provisions that contain an explicit stay requirement—§3 of    
the Federal Arbitration Act and §1292(d)(4) of Title 28.      
Bielski suggests that Congress would not have included        
those  explicit  stay  requirements  in  §3  and  §1292(d)(4) 
unless Congress thought that an interlocutory appeal did      
not ordinarily stay district court proceedings.  Bielski is   
wrong.                                                        
Section  3  of  the  Act  provides  for  a  stay  of  court  
proceedings pending arbitration, not pending an appeal.       
That situation does not fall within the Griggs rule.  No      
background principle requires automatic stays of district     
court  proceedings  pending  arbitration.  In  order  to      
automatically stay court proceedings pending arbitration in   
those cases, Congress therefore affirmatively codified a stay 
requirement.                                                  
As to §1292(d)(4):  When Congress added §1292(d)(4)’s        
           Cite as: 599 U. S. ____ (2023)  9                 
             Opinion of the Court                            
stay requirement in 1988, the relevant subsection already     
contained  a  provision,  §1292(d)(3),  that  expressly  made 
stays of proceedings in certain courts discretionary rather   
than  mandatory.  To  avoid  any  misinterpretation  of       
§1292(d)(4)  because  of  that  preexisting  language  in     
§1292(d)(3), Congress specified the right to an automatic     
stay  pending  appeal  in  §1292(d)(4).    That  unusual      
circumstance does not diminish the operation of the Griggs    
rule in the context of arbitrability appeals.                 
Third, Bielski contends that requiring an automatic stay     
would create a special, arbitration-preferring procedural     
rule. That is incorrect.  In fact, Bielski’s proposed approach 
would disfavor arbitration.  Applying the Griggs rule here    
simply  subjects  arbitrability  appeals  to  the  same  stay 
principles that courts apply in other analogous contexts      
where  an  interlocutory  appeal  is  authorized,  including  
qualified immunity and double jeopardy.  Bielski further      
points to forum selection clauses as an analogy. But unlike   
§16(a) arbitrability appeals, Congress has not created a      
right to an interlocutory appeal for cases involving forum    
selection clauses.  So a stay in the forum selection context  
could be required only in those cases where there is a        
certified  §1292(b)  interlocutory  appeal  of  the  forum    
selection issue.                                              
Fourth, Bielski suggests that there is no need for an        
automatic  stay  because  the  ordinary  discretionary  stay  
factors  would  adequately  protect  parties’  rights  to  an 
interlocutory appellate determination of arbitrability.  To   
begin  with,  experience  shows  that  Bielski  is  incorrect. 
District courts and courts of appeals applying the usual      
four-factor standard for a discretionary stay often deny      
stays in §16(a) appeals because courts applying that test     
often do not consider litigation-related burdens (here, from  
the  continued  District  Court  proceedings)  to  constitute 
irreparable harm.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U. S. 418, 434–    
435 (2009); FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U. S. 232,   
10          COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
             Opinion of the Court                            
244 (1980) (“Mere litigation expense, even substantial and    
unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irreparable injury”    
(internal quotation marks omitted)); App. to Pet. for Cert.   
43a (District Court in Bielski stating that “[m]ere litigation 
expenses do not generally constitute irreparable injury” for  
purposes  of  stay  pending  appeal).  In  any  event,  the   
background Griggs rule applies regardless of how often        
courts  might  otherwise  grant  stays  under  the  ordinary  
discretionary stay factors.                                   
Fifth,  Bielski  relies  on  this  Court’s  statement  that  
questions of arbitrability are “severable from the merits of  
the  underlying  disputes.”  Moses  H.  Cone  Memorial        
Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 21 (1983).    
But  the  sole  issue  here  is  whether  the  district  court’s 
authority to consider a case is “involved in the appeal” when 
an  appellate  court  considers  the  threshold  question  of 
arbitrability.  Griggs, 459 U. S., at 58.  The answer is yes, 
and Moses H. Cone says nothing to the contrary.

We  conclude  that,  after  Coinbase  appealed  from  the    
denial of its motion to compel arbitration, the District Court
was  required  to  stay  its  proceedings.  On  remand,  we   
anticipate that the Ninth Circuit here, as we anticipate in   
§16(a)  appeals  more  generally,  will  proceed  with        
appropriate  expedition  when  considering  Coinbase’s        
interlocutory appeal from the denial of the motion to compel  
arbitration.  We  reverse  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  
Appeals  and  remand  the  case  for  further  proceedings

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
                    No. 22-105 
COINBASE, INC., PETITIONER v. ABRAHAM BIELSKI 
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
          APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT 
                  [June 23, 2023] 
JUSTICE JACKSON, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR and 
JUSTICE KAGAN join, and with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins 
as to Parts II, III, and IV, dissenting. 
When a federal court of appeals conducts interlocutory 
review of a trial court order, the rest of the case remains at 
the trial court level.  Usually, the trial judge then makes a 
particularized determination upon request,  based  on the 
facts and circumstances of that case, as to whether the re- 
maining part of the case should continue unabated or be 
paused (stayed) pending appeal.  This discretionary deci- 
sionmaking promotes procedural fairness because it allows 
for a balancing of all relevant interests.  See Nken v. Holder, 
556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009). 
Today, the Court departs from this traditional approach. 
It holds that, with respect to an interlocutory appeal of a 
trial court order denying arbitration, a trial court must al- 
ways “stay its pre-trial and trial proceedings while the in- 
terlocutory appeal is ongoing.”  Ante, at 1.  In other words, 
in this context, the Court sees fit to impose a mandatory 
general stay of trial court proceedings. 
This mandatory-general-stay rule for interlocutory arbi- 
trability appeals comes out of nowhere.  No statute imposes 
it.  Nor does any decision of this Court.  Yet today’s majority 
invents a new stay rule perpetually favoring one class of 
litigants—defendants  seeking arbitration.  Those  defend- 
ants will now receive a stay even when,  according to the 

2           COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
usual equitable analysis, there is no good reason for one.    
And, in reaching this result, the Court concludes for the     
first time that an interlocutory appeal about one matter (ar- 
bitrability) bars the district court from proceeding on an-   
other (the merits).  That logic has such significant implica- 
tions for federal litigation that the majority itself shies   
away from the Pandora’s box it may have opened.               
I see no basis here for wresting away the discretion tra-    
ditionally entrusted to the judge closest to a case.  I respect-
fully dissent.                                                
                   I                                         
Congress did not impose the mandatory-general-stay rule      
that the majority adopts today.                               
Start with the governing statute.  Congress addressed the    
kind of interlocutory appeals at issue here in 9 U. S. C.     
§16—the section of the Federal Arbitration Act it enacted     
to govern “Appeals.” 102 Stat. 4671 (amending the Federal     
Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq.).  Section 16 provides 
that “[a]n appeal may be taken from” specified orders and     
decisions, and “an appeal may not be taken from” others.      
The appeals that §16 authorizes include interlocutory ap-     
peals  of  orders  denying  requests  for  arbitration.       
§§16(a)(1)(A)–(C).                                            
But nowhere did Congress provide that such an interloc-      
utory appeal automatically triggers a general stay of pre-    
trial and trial proceedings.  As the majority opinion admits, 
§16 never even mentions a stay pending appeal.  Ante, at 3.   
Even beyond that, related provisions confirm that Con-       
gress imposed no mandatory general stay in §16 appeals.       
“Where Congress includes particular language in one sec-      
tion of a statute but omits it in another section of the same 
Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intention-   
ally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”  
Nken, 556 U. S., at 430 (alterations and internal quotation   
marks omitted).  Congress did that here—twice.                
           Cite as: 599 U. S. ____ (2023)  3                 
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
First, Congress expressly mandated a general interlocu-      
tory stay in another provision of the same 1988 law that      
enacted §16. See 102 Stat. 4652, 4670–4671. Like §16, that    
other provision—codified at 28 U. S. C. §1292(d)(4)—au-       
thorizes interlocutory appeals. See §1292(d)(4)(A). But un-   
like §16, the text of that other provision specifies that, upon 
an interlocutory appeal, “proceedings shall be . . . stayed   
until the appeal has been decided.”  §1292(d)(4)(B).  This    
resembles the rule the majority adopts today for §16 ap-      
peals.  Yet Congress omitted it from §16, while simultane-    
ously imposing it in §1292(d)(4).                             
Second, Congress expressly mandated a general interloc-      
utory stay in another provision of the Federal Arbitration    
Act.  Section 3 pertains to a circumstance in which the trial 
court is “satisfied” that an issue should be referred to arbi-
tration. 9 U. S. C. §3. In such a case, the statute expressly 
provides that the trial court “shall on application of one of 
the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration 
has been had.”  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Again, the contrast  
with §16 is stark.  Congress specified a mandatory general    
stay of trial court proceedings in §3 (when the trial court   
determines that arbitration is warranted) but not §16(a)      
(when  the  court  determines  that  arbitration  is  unwar-  
ranted).                                                      
The majority opinion waves away these mandatory-gen-         
eral-stay provisions by jerry-rigging explanations for why    
Congress mandated those stays expressly without doing so      
in §16.  Ante, at 8–9.  But the point remains: Congress fo-   
cused on stays when crafting the 1988 law and the Federal     
Arbitration Act.  And when it intended to mandate interloc-   
utory stays, it said so expressly.  Nothing stopped Congress  
from doing so in §16—yet it chose not to.  This underscores   
that §16 does not mandate a stay.1                            
——————                                                        
1The majority’s explanation for why Congress mandated a stay in 28 
4           COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
Given all this, it is no surprise that Congress’s enact-     
ments barely figure into the majority opinion.  The manda-    
tory-general-stay rule is so untethered from §16 that the     
statutory text has no role in the Court’s reasoning.          
And when Congress’s work finally does take the stage         
near the end of the Court’s analysis, it plays a minor part.  
See ante, at 6–7.  The Court notes that other statutes ex-    
pressly provide that appeals do not automatically stay dis-   
trict court proceedings.  Ante, at 7, and n. 6.  From this, the 
Court tries to draw an across-the-board inference that, un-   
less Congress expressly disavows the majority’s manda-        
tory-general-stay rule, that rule applies.                    
The Court’s inference fails.  The statutes that the major-   
——————                                                        
U. S. C. §1292(d)(4) also makes no sense.  According to the majority, Con-
gress usually remains silent when it intends to mandate a stay.  Ante, at 
6–7, 8–9.  Congress expressly imposed a mandatory stay in §1292(d)(4),
the majority says, only because a pre-existing provision, §1292(d)(3), 
would otherwise have made stays in §1292(d)(4) appeals discretionary. 
Ante, at 8–9.                                                 
But that last point holds no water.  Paragraph (3) has no bearing on
paragraph (4), because these two provisions govern different kinds of ap-
peals.                                                        
Specifically, paragraph (3) governs certain appeals by permission, 
while paragraph (4) governs a separate set of appeals as of right. Para-
graph (3) addresses events unique to permissive appeals: “Neither the 
application for nor the granting of an appeal” stays trial court proceed-
ings.  §1292(d)(3) (emphasis added).  Paragraph (3) thus corresponds to 
paragraphs (1) and (2), which authorize permissive appeals “if applica-
tion is made” and granted.  §§1292(d)(1)–(2).  Meanwhile, paragraph (4) 
separately authorizes certain as-of-right appeals, §1292(d)(4)(A), and it
imposes mandatory stays in such appeals, §1292(d)(4)(B). In an appeal 
as of right under paragraph (4), paragraph (3) never kicks in, because 
there is no “application for” or “granting of” an appeal, §1292(d)(3). 
Thus, the majority’s story—that Congress needed express stay lan-
guage to avoid overlap with paragraph (3)—turns on a red herring. 
There is no such overlap.  Instead, only the more straightforward expla-
nation  remains:  Congress  imposed  a  mandatory  general  stay  in 
§1292(d)(4)—but not 9 U. S. C. §16—because it intended such a stay un-
der the former but not the latter.

             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
ity points to have nothing to do with arbitration or §16 (un- 
like the two provisions discussed above, which were enacted   
in the same 1988 law as §16 and codified alongside §16 in     
the Federal Arbitration Act, respectively, supra, at 3).      
Moreover, and in any event, the majority’s cited statutes    
do not support the majority’s mandatory-general-stay rule.    
The majority invokes statutes that expressly preclude au-     
tomatic stays of all trial court proceedings.  But if the ma- 
jority is correct that Congress intended the opposite when    
a statute is silent, then stays of all trial court proceedings
would be required. Yet, the majority’s own holding does not   
go that far.  See ante, at 4, n. 2.  Instead, the majority re-
quires stays for some proceedings (those related to the mer-  
its) but not others (those related to costs and fees), ibid.—a 
line that appears nowhere in the majority’s cited statutes.   
At the end of the day, the best the majority can do is point 
to a smattering of provisions that do not contain the rule    
that the majority adopts. And those provisions do not even    
relate to §16 or the majority’s rule (staying litigation gener-
ally but not proceedings on costs and fees).  Neither those   
statutes, nor any other, imposes on arbitrability appeals the 
stay rule that the Court announces.                           
                   II                                        
Unable to locate its rule in a statute, the majority opinion 
pivots to “background principle[s].”  Ante, at 3. But there is 
no background mandatory-general-stay rule.                    
To the contrary, the background rule is that courts have     
case-by-case discretion regarding whether or not to issue a   
stay.  “[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the  
power inherent in every court to control the disposition of   
the causes on its docket.”  Landis v. North American Co.,     
299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936).  That power is discretionary—it    
“calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh com-    
peting interests” in each particular case.  Id., at 254–255.  
6           COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
One key to this discretionary-stay tradition is its “supple-  
ness of adaptation to varying conditions.”  Id., at 256.  A   
stay “is not a matter of right” and cannot be imposed “re-    
flexively.”  Nken,  556  U. S.,  at  427  (internal  quotation
marks omitted).                                               
That has long been the default rule.  A court’s discretion   
“to grant a stay pending review” is “firmly imbedded in our   
judicial system, consonant with the historic procedures of    
federal appellate courts.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks   
omitted).  It is “a power as old as the judicial system of the 
nation.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted); see 28    
U. S. C. §1651(a) (All Writs Act, originally enacted in 1789, 
1 Stat. 81–82).                                               
Significantly for present purposes, discretionary stays      
are the default for interlocutory appeals in particular—and   
this dates back to the first federal interlocutory-appeal stat-
ute in 1891. Judiciary Act of 1891, §7, 26 Stat. 828; see 15A 
C.Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Pro-   
cedure §3906, p. 346 (3d ed. 2022).  There, Congress estab-   
lished that “proceedings . . . in the court below shall not be 
stayed unless otherwise ordered by that court during the      
pendency  of  such  appeal.”  §7,  26  Stat.  828  (emphasis  
added).                                                       
That statute cemented a background discretionary-stay        
rule that governed even where Congress was silent—as this     
Court has repeatedly recognized.  Shortly after the 1891      
Act, a case arose under conditions in which the Act was si-   
lent about whether a stay should issue.  In re Haberman       
Mfg. Co., 147 U. S. 525, 530 (1893) (finding “no express pro- 
vision” on point).  This Court applied the background rule:   
“[T]he Circuit Court had a discretion to grant or refuse” a   
stay.  Ibid.  Another case of statutory silence arose a few   
years later. In re McKenzie, 180 U. S. 536, 550–551 (1901).   
Again, this Court reiterated federal courts’ “inherent power  
. . . to stay or supersede proceedings on appeal” from an in- 
terlocutory order. Id., at 551. As this Court summarized in   
           Cite as: 599 U. S. ____ (2023)  7                 
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
yet another case, the rule is that the trial court has “author-
ity” during an interlocutory appeal “to take further proceed- 
ings in the cause, unless in its discretion it orders them to 
be  stayed,  pending  the  appeal.”    Smith  v.  Vulcan  Iron 
Works, 165 U. S. 518, 525 (1897).  That authority is “recog-  
nized” by the 1891 Act but existed already as a traditional   
matter, “often exercised by other courts of chancery.”  Ibid. 
This was the background against which Congress en-           
acted §16.  And—importantly—courts understood stays as        
discretionary with respect to interlocutory appeals concern-  
ing  arbitrability.  Before Congress enacted §16,  parties    
brought  interlocutory  arbitrability  appeals  under  other  
sources of appellate jurisdiction, and courts treated stays as
discretionary, not mandatory.2  Yet, according to the major-  
ity, Congress sought to displace that common understand-      
ing when it enacted §16—without saying anything at all        
about stays pending appeal.                                   
Even setting all that aside, the majority opinion’s reli-    
ance on a “background” rule, ante, at 3, still fails.  The ma-
jority has not shown that its own rule (the mandatory-gen-    
eral-stay  rule)  existed  as  a  background  matter  when    
Congress enacted §16 in 1988. Indeed, the majority opinion    
does not identify a single case in which this Court imposed   
a mandatory general stay of pre-trial and trial proceedings   
pending an interlocutory appeal.  Not in an arbitration       
case.  Not in an analogous case about the proper adjudica-    
tory forum for a dispute.  Not in any interlocutory appeal at 
all.

Because  neither  the  statute  nor  any  background  law    
states that an interlocutory appeal over arbitrability trig-  
gers a mandatory general stay of trial court proceedings,     
the majority opinion resorts to spinning such a rule from a   
single sentence in Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount      
Co., 459 U. S. 56 (1982) (per curiam). But Griggs expresses   
a far narrower principle, and is thus insufficient to support 
the majority’s mandatory-general-stay rule.                   
Griggs  stands  for  a  modest  proposition:  Two  courts    
should avoid exercising control over the same order or judg-  
ment simultaneously.  The problem Griggs identifies is the    
“danger a district court and a court of appeals would be sim- 
ultaneously analyzing the same judgment.”  Id., at 59. The    
cure Griggs prescribes is that “[t]he filing of a notice of ap-
peal . . . divests the district court of its control over those 
aspects of the case involved in the appeal.”  Id., at 58.     
And the reason is simple.  Two courts simultaneously an-     
alyzing the same judgment could step on each other’s toes.    
It would interfere with the appellate court’s review of an    
order if the district court modified that order mid-appeal.   
Instead, an order should be reviewed by one court at a time.  
This notion of “one order, one reviewing court” is all that  
was at issue in Griggs. Griggs concerned a party that tried   
to appeal a judgment while the District Court was still con-  
sidering whether to alter that same judgment.  Id., at 56.    
The Court held that the appeal needed to wait until after     
the District Court’s work on that judgment was done.  Id.,    
at 60–61.  This result, which followed from the Federal       
Rules of Appellate Procedure, was necessary to “avoi[d]” the  
situation “in which district courts and courts of appeals     
would both have had the power to modify the same judg-        
ment.”  Id., at 60 (emphasis added).                          
Properly understood and applied here, Griggs divests the     
district court of control over only a narrow slice of the case.  
The interlocutory appeal addresses an order declining to      
           Cite as: 599 U. S. ____ (2023)  9                 
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
compel arbitration.  Griggs merely prevents the district      
court from modifying that order—i.e., Griggs prevents the     
district judge from revisiting whether to compel arbitration  
while the appeal is pending.  Griggs does not stop the dis-   
trict court from proceeding on matters other than arbitra-    
bility.                                                       
The  majority  opinion,  however,  transmogrifies  Griggs    
into a sweeping stay of “pre-trial and trial proceedings” on  
not just arbitrability, but also the merits.  Ante, at 1.  Ac-
cording  to  the  majority,  if  the  question  on  appeal  is
“whether  the  litigation  may  go  forward  in  the  district 
court,” then the district court loses control over “the entire 
case.”  Ante, at 3–4 (emphasis added; internal quotation      
marks omitted).                                               
That rule far surpasses the statement in Griggs—the sole     
statement  on  which  the  majority  relies—that  a  district 
court loses “control over those aspects of the case involved  
in the appeal.”  459 U. S., at 58; ante, at 3.  Only the arbi-
trability order is on appeal, not the merits. And those mat-  
ters are distinct.  As this Court recognized (before Congress 
enacted §16), “arbitrability” is “easily severable from the   
merits of the underlying disputes.”  Moses H. Cone Memo-      
rial  Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U. S. 1, 21      
(1983).                                                       
The majority cannot justify why it treats these “easily      
severable” matters as intertwined in an arbitrability ap-     
peal.  “[T]he question on appeal,” as the majority opinion    
correctly identifies, is “whether the case belongs in arbitra-
tion.”  Ante, at 3.  But the questions remaining before the   
district court are different: whether the claims have merit,  
whether the parties are entitled to the discovery they seek,  
and so on. Proceedings on those questions would not inter-    
fere with the appellate court’s review of the arbitrability or-
der. Those proceedings, in other words, do not implicate the  
Griggs principle, which addresses the “danger a district      
10          COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
court and a court of appeals would be simultaneously ana-     
lyzing the same judgment.”  459 U. S., at 59.                 
The Court today expands Griggs beyond what the Con-          
gress that enacted §16 could have foreseen, let alone si-     
lently incorporated.  Indeed, the majority can identify no    
other time this Court wielded Griggs to mandate a stay of     
all merits proceedings just because a distinct procedural     
question was on appeal.                                       
In fact, the majority’s supercharged version of Griggs con-  
tradicts its own account of Congress’s intent.  Consider the  
statutes that the majority points to as models of how Con-    
gress would reject a mandatory-general-stay rule.  Ante, at   
6–7, and n. 6; see supra, at 4–5.  Under those statutes, the  
majority says, Congress intends that an interlocutory ap-     
peal does “not . . . automatically stay district court proceed-
ings.”  Ante, at 7.  Yet, the majority also seemingly accepts 
that under those statutes, “the Griggs principle applies.”    
Ante, at 5.  And per “the Griggs principle” as the majority   
sees it, in some cases an interlocutory appeal does automat-  
ically stay district court proceedings.  Ante, at 3–4.  So a  
mandatory general stay is thus both prohibited (by the stat-  
utory text) and required (by the majority’s view of Griggs).3 
As this contradiction underscores, the majority’s holding is  
untethered from any statute and any existing conception of    
——————                                                        
3This contradiction arises, for example, under 28 U. S. C. §1292(b), one 
of the statutes that the majority cites as prohibiting mandatory general 
stays. See ante, at 7, n. 6 (citing Act of Sept. 2, 1958, Pub. L. 85–919, 72
Stat. 1770 (codified at §1292(b))). Section 1292(b) authorizes permissive
interlocutory appeals from a wide range of orders involving “controlling 
question[s] of law”—including rulings on arbitrability.  Arbitrability ap-
peals under §1292(b) were commonplace  when Congress enacted 9 
U. S. C. §16 in 1988.  See, e.g., Danford v. Schwabacher, 488 F. 2d 454, 
457 (CA9 1973) (“Since 1958 interlocutory arbitration orders have been 
reviewable in accordance with the procedures prescribed by 28 U. S. C. 
§1292(b)”).  And in a §1292(b) arbitrability appeal, the majority’s reading 
of §1292(b) would prohibit a mandatory general stay, while the majority’s 
view of Griggs would require one.

                  IV                                         
To justify its new mandatory-general-stay rule, the ma-      
jority ultimately rests on its assessment of what is “sensi-  
ble.”  Ante, at 5–6.  But even the majority’s policy concerns 
do not support its rule.                                      
The dispute here turns on a subset of cases—those in         
which a stay is not warranted under the usual discretionary   
standard.  See Nken, 556 U. S., at 434.  All agree that an    
interlocutory appeal should trigger a stay if that standard   
is met.  But the majority goes further and requires a stay in 
all cases. Indeed, the majority mandates a stay even if none  
of the traditional stay prerequisites are present: likelihood 
of success on the merits, irreparable harm, favorable bal-    
ance of equities, and alignment with the public interest.     
See ibid.                                                     
The majority offers no good reason for that result.  The     
majority says that an automatic stay protects the party       
seeking arbitration and conserves resources in case the dis-  
pute “ultimately head[s] to arbitration” after appeal.  Ante, 
at 6.  But the concern fades if that scenario is unrealistic— 
i.e., if the party seeking arbitration is unlikely to succeed 
on appeal.                                                    
The majority’s concern is even weaker when a stay would      
harm the opposing party and the public interest much more     
than it would protect the party seeking arbitration.  Take,   
for example, a case in which crucial evidence would be lost   
if discovery is delayed.  Say a witness is on her deathbed.   
Under the majority’s rule, if an interlocutory arbitrability  
appeal under §16(a) is pending, discovery must be stayed      
and the evidence must be lost.  That is apparently so even    
if the parties agree they wish to proceed with discovery.     
The majority’s rule also prevents courts from crafting       
case-specific solutions to balance all the interests at stake. 
Under the traditional discretionary-stay rule, for instance,  
12          COINBASE, INC. v. BIELSKI                         
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
a judge could allow the parties to conduct only the forms of  
discovery that would also be permitted in arbitration.  That  
would save time and leave nobody worse off even if, as the    
majority fears, the dispute ultimately heads to arbitration.  
But this kind of equitable resolution, which the court and    
the parties might consider “sensible,” ante, at 6, is forbidden 
under the majority’s mandatory-general-stay rule.             
In addition, for each of the majority’s concerns favoring a  
mandatory stay, there are countervailing considerations.      
The majority professes interest in “efficiency.”  Ibid.  But  
forcing district court proceedings to a halt—for months or    
years while the appeal runs its course—is itself inefficient. 
The majority also fears losing other “asserted benefits of ar-
bitration” without a stay.  Ibid.  But with a stay, the party 
opposing arbitration loses the benefits of immediate litiga-  
tion.  A plaintiff’s request for injunctive protection against 
imminent harm, for example, goes unanswered under the         
majority’s rule.  Similarly, while the majority laments set-  
tlement pressure on parties seeking arbitration, ibid., the   
rule it announces imposes settlement pressure in the oppo-    
site direction.  With justice delayed while the case is on    
hold, parties “could be forced to settle,” ibid., because they 
do not wish—or cannot afford—to leave their claims in         
limbo.  Incongruously, the majority inflicts these burdens    
on the party that won the arbitrability issue before the dis- 
trict court (the party opposing arbitration).                 
In categorically resolving these conflicts in favor of the   
pro-arbitration party, the majority’s analysis comes down     
to this: Because the pro-arbitration party gets an interlocu- 
tory appeal, it should also get an automatic stay.  Ibid.; see 
L.Numeroff, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie (1985). But Con-     
gress was entitled to give one without the other.  And the    
right to interlocutory appeal is valuable on its own.  It is, as 
the majority explains, “a rare statutory exception to the     
usual rule that parties may not appeal before final judg-     
ment.” Ante, at 3. Even without a stay, if the interlocutory  
           Cite as: 599 U. S. ____ (2023)  13                
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
appeal succeeds, the pro-arbitration party gets its wish and  
the dispute goes to arbitration.                              
Perhaps for those reasons, real-life parties do not agree    
with the majority that an interlocutory arbitrability appeal  
is pointless without an automatic stay.  No stay was issued   
in this case, for example, yet Coinbase still pursued its in- 
terlocutory appeal.  Nor did other parties stop bringing in-  
terlocutory arbitrability appeals in the Circuits that had in-
terpreted §16 to impose no automatic stay.4                   
Yet this Court steps in to give the pro-arbitration party    
the additional right to an automatic stay that Congress       
withheld. Now, any defendant that devises a non-frivolous     
argument for arbitration can not only appeal, but also press  
pause on the case—leaving plaintiffs to suffer harm, lose     
evidence, and bleed dry their patience and funding in the     
meantime.  To confer that power on a class of litigants,      
based on blanket judgments resolving competing policy con-    
cerns, is Congress’s domain, not ours. And where Congress     
is silent, the job of managing particular litigation, in light
of the concrete circumstances presented,  belongs to the      
judge closest to a case.

4For over a decade, the Second, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits have all held 
that a §16(a) appeal triggers no mandatory general stay.  Motorola Credit 
Corp. v. Uzan, 388 F. 3d 39, 53–54 (CA2 2004); Britton v. Co-op Banking 
Group, 916 F. 2d 1405, 1412 (CA9 1990); Weingarten Realty Investors v. 
Miller, 661 F. 3d 904, 907–910 (CA5 2011).  And those Circuits face no 
shortage of interlocutory §16(a) appeals.  See, e.g., Palacios v. Alifine 
Dining, Inc., 2023 WL 2469765 (CA2, Mar. 13, 2023); Laurel v. Cintas 
Corp., 2023 WL 2363686 (CA9, Mar. 6, 2023); NATS, Inc. v. Radiation 
Shield Technologies, Inc., 2023 WL 2416160 (CA2, Mar. 9, 2023); Hill v.

                   V                                         
The Court today ventures down an uncharted path—and          
that way lies madness.  Never before had this Court man-      
dated a general stay simply because an interlocutory appeal   
poses the question “whether the litigation may go forward     
in the district court.”  Ante, at 3 (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  And a wide array of appeals seemingly fits that    
bill.                                                         
Indeed, any appeal over the proper forum for a dispute       
would arguably raise the same question.  After all, “an ar-   
bitration agreement is ‘a specialized kind of forum-selection 
clause.’” Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana, 596 U. S.    
___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 11) (quoting Scherk v. Alberto- 
Culver Co., 417 U. S. 506, 519 (1974)).  If arbitration ap-   
peals require stays of all pre-trial and trial proceedings,   
why  not  all  appeals  about  forum-selection  agreements?   
And why not appeals over non-contractual disputes over the    
proper adjudicator, like venue, personal jurisdiction, forum  
non conveniens, federal-court jurisdiction, and abstention?   
For that matter, “virtually every right that could be en-    
forced appropriately by pretrial dismissal might loosely be   
described as conferring a ‘right not to stand trial.’”  Digital 
Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U. S. 863, 873   
(1994). “Such motions can be made in virtually every case.”   
Ibid. Does every interlocutory appeal concerning a case-dis-  
positive issue now trigger a mandatory general stay of trial  
court proceedings?                                            
Taken that broadly, the mandatory-general-stay rule the      
Court adopts today would upend federal litigation as we       
know it.  Aware that any interlocutory appeal on a disposi-   
tive issue grinds the plaintiff’s case to a halt, defendants  
would presumably pursue that tactic at every opportunity.     
This would occur, for example, in interlocutory appeals       
available as of right under 28 U. S. C. §1292(a)(1) from or-  
ders granting preliminary injunctions.  Any defense lawyer    
worth her salt would invoke the right to take that appeal     
           Cite as: 599 U. S. ____ (2023)  15                
             JACKSON, J., dissenting                         
and throw up some objection—to venue, jurisdiction, or a      
dispositive element of the merits—to trigger a mandatory      
stay. For plaintiffs, then, every preliminary-injunction mo-  
tion becomes a trap: Even if the motion is granted, the de-   
fendant can take that opportunity to stop the trial court     
proceedings in their tracks.                                  
Facing  these  destabilizing  consequences,  the  majority   
stops short of following its own reasoning to that ominous    
conclusion.  Today’s holding reaches only arbitration ap-     
peals under §16(a). Ante, at 1, 7.  And it might well be that 
the  concerns  motivating  today’s  mandatory-general-stay    
rule do not extend beyond arbitration.  So the majority will  
not commit, for example, to concluding that appeals over      
non-arbitration forum-selection clauses warrant the same      
mandatory stay.  Ante, at 9.                                  
I agree with that hesitation—even one step further down      
this path is much too far. The mandatory-general-stay rule    
that the Court manufactures is unmoored from Congress’s       
commands and this Court’s precedent.  And the windfall        
that the Court gives to defendants seeking arbitration, pref- 
erencing their interests over all others, is entirely unwar-  
ranted. The Court now mandates that result no matter how      
unjust that outcome is, according to traditional equitable    
standards, in a given case. This endeavor is unfounded, un-   
wise, and—most fundamentally—not our role.

           This matter is before the Court on the motions of Grubhub, Inc. (“Grubhub”), Uber 
Technologies, Inc. (“Uber” or “Uber Eats”), and Postmates Inc. (“Postmates”) to compel plaintiffs 
Mariam Davitashvili, Adam Bensimon, Philip Eliades, Jonathan Swaby, John Boisi, and Nathan 
Obey  (the  “Platform  Plaintiffs”)  to  arbitrate  their  claims,  based  on  arbitration  provisions  in 
defendants’ respective terms of use.  (Dkt 72; Dkt 76)  For the reasons set forth below, defendants’ 
motions are denied. 

                                    Facts 
           This matter arises from a putative class action involving the contractual relationships 
between restaurants and online ordering platforms for restaurant meals.  The amended complaint 
alleges that the defendants each unlawfully has fixed prices for restaurant meals by entering into 
restrictive agreements with restaurants that preclude those restaurants from charging lower prices off- 
platform.  The no-price-competition clauses (“NPCCs”) contained in these agreements prohibit 
restaurants that sell through Grubhub or Uber from selliag meals at lower prices either directly to 

consumers or through a competing platform, like Doordash.' Postmates requires a narrower version 
of an NPCC, which prohibits restaurants from selling meals at lower prices directly to consumers, 
but not through other channels.’  Plaintiffs claim that defendants thus have caused them to pay 
artificially high prices for restaurant meals.’ They seek damages and injunctive relief under Section 
1 of the Sherman Act and its state analogues on behalf of themselves and three putative nationwide 
classes. Plaintiffs seek damages for (i) their direct purchases from restaurants bound by defendants’ 
NPCCs and (ii) their purchases from such restaurants through non-defendant platforms.’ 
            On March 30, 2022, the Court denied defendants’ joint motion to dismiss these 
claims.  (Dkt 46)  Approximately two months later, defendants served interrogatories on plaintiffs, 
requesting that they “identify the Meal Order Platforms through which” they ordered “at any point 
during the Class Period.’*  In response, the Platform Plaintiffs disclosed that they each had used at 
least one of the defendants’ platforms, whereas plaintiff Malik Drewey disclosed that he never had 
used those platforms.° Defendants move to compel arbitration against the Platform Plaintiffs on the

The Arbitration Clauses in Defendants’ Terms of Use 
     A,     Grubhub’s Terms of Use 
           Grubhub  merged  with  Seamless  North  America  LLC  (“Seamless”),  another 
meal-delivery platform, in August 2013.’  It is undisputed that each Platform Plaintiff opened an 
account with either Grubhub or its predecessor in interest, Seamless, prior to the filing of this action 
in April 2020. Grubhub asserts that its terms of use were published on its website “[bJefore this case 
was filed and during the pendency of the litigation.”*  However, Grubhub submitted no evidence 
demonstrating how those terms appeared or could be accessed.” 
           Grubhub claims that it requires customers to agree to its terms of use each time a 
customer places a pick-up or delivery order.'° It is undisputed that the Platform Plaintiffs each have 
placed orders on Grubhub during the pendency of this action and since Grubhub updated its terms 
of use on December 14, 2021. 
           Grubhub argues that the Platform Plaintiffs are bound by the updated terms, which 
govern consumers “use” of Grubhub’s platform. 
           First, the Terms of Use provide: 
           “Grubhub Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Grubhub,’ ‘we,’ ‘our,’ or 
           ‘us’) own and operate certain websites, including related subdomains; our mobile,

           kiosks or other online services; other tools, technology and programs (collectively, 
           the ‘Platform’) and all associated services (collectively, the ‘Services’); in each case, 
           that reference and incorporate this Agreement...    This Agreement constitutes a 
           contract between you and us that governs your access and use of the Platform and 
           Services." 
           They also contain a provision entitled “Mutual Arbitration Provision,” which states 
that Grubhub users are required to submit “any” dispute with Grubhub to arbitration: 
           ‘“‘Youand Grubhub agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out 
           of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement or payments by or to Grubhub, 
           or that in any way relate to your use of the Platform, the Materials, the Services, 
           and/or other content on the Platform, your relationship witk Grubhub, or any other 
           dispute  with  Grubhub,  (whether  based  in  contract,  tort,  statute,  fraud, 
           misrepresentation, or any other legal theory) (each, a ‘Dispute’) shall be submitted 
           exclusively to binding arbitration. Dispute shall have the broadest possitle meaning. 
           This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the 
           existence of this or any prior Agreement as well as claims that may arjse: after the 
           termination of this Agreement. This Mutual Arbitration Agreement is intended to be 
           broadly interpreted.’”’'” The Grubhub arbitration clause states also that “issues related

           to the scope, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement are for a court 
           to decide.” 
           Part III of the “Dispute Resolution” section is entitled “Class Action and Collective 
Relief Waiver” and provides in relevant part: 
           “You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, except as 
           set out in Section VII below, there shall be no right or authority for any dispute to 
           be arbitrated or litigated on a  class, joint, collective or consolidated basis or ina 
           purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or as a private 
           attorney general or for public injunctive relief.”" 

     B.     Uber’s Terms of Use 
           The Platform Plaintiffs each created Uber accounts between 2014 and 2018.’° Uber 
claims that, in the process of creating their accounts, the Platform Plaintiffs each agreed to Uber’s 
terms of use in effect at that time. 
           Uber updated its terms of use on December 16, 2021 ©  Uber claims that it notified 
users of that update via “an in-app blocking pop-up screen that appeared when the user opened an

affirmatively check a box labeled ‘By checking the box, I have reviewed and agreed to the Terms of 
Use and acknowledged the Privacy Notice’ and click ‘Confirm.’”'* Each of the Platform Serie 
except for Adam Bensimon, provided “check-box consent” via this pop-up screen, and thus are 
bound by Uber’s December 202i terms of use.’® As to plaintiff Bensimon, Uber asserts that he has 
used his “Uber account as recently as November 18, 2021,” and that he therefore is bound by Uber’s 
June 2021 terms of use.”° 
           For purposes of Uber’s motion, Uber and the Platform Plaintiffs treat the  July 2021 
and December 2021 terms of use as substantially identical.*’  In both versions, the tertas of use 
govern consumers’ “access or use” of Uber’s platform as follows: 
           “Uber provides a personalized multipurpose: digital marketplace platform (‘Uber 
           Marketplace Platform’) that enables you to conveniently find, request, or receive 
           transportation, logistics and/or delivery services from third-party providers that meet 
           your needs and interests.  These Terms of Use (‘Terms’) govern your access or use,

           Section 2(a)(1)  of Uber’s terms  of use  contains  an arbitration provision titled 
“Covered Disputes,” which provides:

           dispute, claim, or controversy in any way arising out of or relating to (i) these Terms

           (including, but not limited to, your use of the Uber Marketplace Platform or the driver 
           version of the Uber App), regardless whether the dispute, claim, or controversy 
           occurred or accrued before or after the date you agreed to the Terms and regardless 
           whether you allege that the personal injury was experienced by you or anyone else; 
           and (iv) your relationship with Uber, will be settled by binding individual arbitration

           Section 2(a)(2), titled “Class Action Waiver,” expands the scope of Uber’s arbitration 
rights from those expressed in Section 2(a)(1). It provides in pertinent part: “You acknowledge and 
agree that any and all disputes, claims, or controversies between the parties shall be resolved only 
in individual arbitration.”** That section provides also: 
           “The parties expressly waive the right to have any dispute, claim, or controversy

     C.     Postmates’ Terms of Use 
           Between 2015 and 2018, plaintiffs Boisi, Davitashvili, Obey, and Swaby created user 
accounts with Postmates.”’  Postmates was acquired by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Uber on December 1, 2020.” 
           Uber asserts that Postmates emailed users between March 17, 2021 and mid-April 
2021 informing them that “the Postmates App had been updated, and that their accounts would be 
linked with Uber.””  This email included a blue hyperlink to Uber’s terms of use and informed 
Postmates users that they would be subject to an updated arbitration agreement.”  Plaintiffs Boisi, 
Davitashvili, Obey, and Swaby thereafter accepted Uber’s December 2021 terms of use, which 
defined Uber to include “its subsidiaries,” including Postmates.*!  Thus, Uber argues that those 
plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate “any disputes they may have” with Postmates on an individual, non-class 
basis through binding arbitration.*”

Legal Standard 
           Section 2 of the FAA provides, in relevant part, as follows: 
           “A written provision in...  a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce 
           to  settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or 
           transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds 
           as exist at law or in equity for the revoca‘ion of any contract.”*° 
           Under Section 4 of the Act, a party to “a written agreement for arbitration” may 
petition a district court “for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided

           The Supreme Court has held that express class action waivers also are valid and enforceable.

           waiver upon holding that the FAA preempted California state law rendering class-arbitration 
           waivers unenforceable); Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., 570 U.S. 228, 233 (2013) 
           (enforcing express class action waiver after finding that “[n]o contrary congressional 
           command” overrode the overarching principle that “arbitration is a matter of contract”), 

                                                                           13 
for in such agreement.”*°  To decide whether the parties agreed to arbitrate, a court must apply 
“ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.”*’ Significantly, the FAA was 
intended to make arbitration agreements “as enforceable as other contracts, but not more so.’** Thus, 
“the FAA does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so.”*?  Nor does it 
require arbitration when, under generally applicable principles of state law, the agreement would be 
unenforceable.” 
           “In deciding a motion to compel, courts apply a ‘standard similar to that applicable 
for amotion for summary judgment’” and “draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving 
party.*!  The movant “bears an initial burden of demonstrating that an agreement to arbitrate was 
made.””’  If the moving party fails to make an adequate showing, the motion to compel arbitration

evidentiary facts,“ the burden shifts to the party “seeking to avoid arbitration” to “show the 
agreement to be inapplicable or invalid.“ 
           Once a court finds that the movant has satisfied its initial burden, “the question of 
whether the particular dispute [at issue] is subject to an arbitration agreement “is typically an issue 
for judicial determination.’”**  If, however, the agreement contains a provision that “cleariy and 
unmistakably” delegates the threshold issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator,” such a delegation must 
be enforced “even if the court thinks that the [movant’s] arbitrability claim is wholly groundless.’”“*

case “the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with that [delegation

            If a court reaches the arbitrability issue, the  Second Circuit instructs courts to 
“undertake  a  three-part  inquiry”  when  evaluating  a  motion  to  compel  arbitration.”   “First, 
recognizing there is some range in the breadth of arbitration clauses, a court should classify the 
particular clause as either broad or narrow.”*'  The Circuit has described a “clause submitting to 
arbitration ‘any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the agreement” as the “paradigm 
of a broad [arbitration] clause.”  “Next, if reviewing a narrow clause, the court must determine 
whether the dispute is over an issue that is on its face within the purview of the clause, or over a 
collateral issue that is somehow connected to the main agreement that contains the arbitration 
clause.”  In general, “[w]here the arbitration clause is narrow, a collateral matter will . . . be ruled 
beyond  its  purview.”   By  contrast,  “[w]here the  arbitration  clause  is  broad,  there  arises  a 
presumption of arbitrability and arbitration of even a collateral matter will be ordered if the claim

Uber and Postmates Satisfied Their Initial Burden as to All Platform Plaintiffs Except Bensimon 
           The  Platform  Plaintiffs  claim  that  Uber  has  failed  in  its  initial  burden  of 
“demonstrating that an agreement to arbitrate was made” as to plaintiff Bensimon.*’ Moreover, they 
claim that defendants Postmates and Grubhub have failed to establish that any plaintiff assented to 
their terms of use.  Plaintiffs are correct that Uber has not satisfied its initial burden as to plaintiff 
Bensimon and that Grubhub has failed as to all plaintiffs.  However, Uber has satisfied its initial 
burden that all Platform Plaintiffs, with the exception of Bensimon, agreed to an arbitration clause 
covering certain claims against Postmates. 

     A.     All  Platform  Plaintiffs  Except  Bensimon  Assented to  Uber’s  December  2021 
           Arbitration Clause 
           With respect to Uber’s December 2021 terms of use, Uber has set forth evidence — 
and plaintiffs do not dispute — that plaintiffs Boisi, Davitashvili, Eliades, Obey, and Swaby expressly

           Plaintiffs Boisi, Davitashvili, Eliades, Obey, and Swaby do not dispute that they manifested 
           assent to Uber’s December 2021 terms of use.  See Dkt 87, at 28-29. 

                                                                           17 
manifested assent to these terms through clickwrap agreements.”  Uber notified users of those 
updated terms through an in-app blocking pop-up screen that appeared when a user opened an Uber 
app following the December 2021 update.°*’  The pop-up screen had a header that stated, “We’ve 
updated our terms.”  Below that, in bigger text, it stated, “We encourage you to read our updated 
Terms in full.”®  The pop-up screen provided a hyperlink to Uber’s terms of use.°’  The words 
“Terms of Use” were displayed in bright blue text that contrasted with the other font colors, 
indicating they were hyperlinks.  Ifa user clicked the hyperlink, the terms of use were displayed.” 
To proceed past the pop-up screen, users were required to check affirmatively a box labeled, “By 
checking the box, I have reviewed and agreed to the Terms of Use and acknowledge the Privacy 
Notice” and subsequently were required to click a button labeled “Confirm.’””?  It is undisputed that 
plaintiffs Boisi, Davitashvili, Eliades, Obey, and Swaby clicked “Confirm” on this pop-up screen, 

     58 
           See Dkt 77, at 9-10; Dkt 87, at 28-29. 
           It is undisputed that plaintiff Bensimon’s most recent use of the Uber platform was on 
           November 18, 2021 and the December 2021 terms of use do not apply to him.

thereby manifesting assent to Uber’s terms of use, which contained an arbitration clause, delegation 
clause, and class action waiver.” 
           The arbitration clause in Uber’s December 2021 terms of use covers certain disputes 
with Postmates also.  Those terms require “Uber” users “to resolve any claim that [they] may have 
against Uber on an individual basis in arbitration as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement.”®  The 
December 2021 terms of use expressly define “Uber” to include “its subsidiaries.”°° Postmates has 
been a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber since December 1, 2020.  Accordingly, Postmates has 
satisfied its initial burden of “demonstrating that an agreement to arbitrate was made” between 
Postmates and plaintiffs Boisi, Davitashvili, Eliades, Obey, and Swaby.®’ 
           In the alternative, Uber argues that all of the Platform Plaintiffs, including plaintiff 
Bensimon, agreed to arbitrate disputes with Uber or Postmates pursuant to prior versions of Uber’s 
terms of use or Postmates’ pre-acquisition terms of use.  With respect to all of these alleged

arbitration  agreements,  Uber has  not  satisfied  its  burden  of demonstrating “by a showing of 
evidentiary facts” that an agreement to arbitrate was made between Uber or Postmates and the 
Platform Plaintiffs.” 
           Questions concerning whether the Platform Plaintiffs entered into valid arbitration 
agreements under the various contracts at issue are governed by either New York or California law 
depending on the particular contract and plaintiff at issue.  For example, Uber’s July 2021 terms of 
use, which were in effect when Bensimon last used his Uber account, specified that they would be 
“governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.””  Uber’s 
December 2021 terms of use, on the other hand, include a general choice of law provision stating that 
the terms shall be construed in accordance with “the laws of the state in which your dispute arises.””! 
In either event, the Second Circuit has found that New York and California apply “substantially 
similar rules for determining whether the parties have mutually assented to a contract term.””” 
           Except with respect to its December 2021 terms of use, Uber has not established that 
any plaintiff expressly manifested assent to any arbitration agreement with Uber or Postmates.” 
Moreover, Uber has failed to establish that the Platform Plaintiffs were on “reasonable notice”

such arbitration agreement.”*  Uber has not submitted any evidence to demonstrate that Uber or 
Postmates’ website or app would have put a reasonable person in the Platform Plaintiffs’ position 
on notice of the existence of any of the alleged arbitration agreements. For example, Uber has failed 
to provide sufficient information about what its app or web page looked like when the Platform 
Plaintiffs initially signed up or at any other relevant time prior to December 2021. Without such 
information,  it  is  impossible  for  the  Court  to  conclude  that  the  Platform  Plaintiffs  were  on 
constructive notice of any arbitration agreement other than the December 2021 terms of use.” Thus, 
with  the  exception  of the  December  2021  terms,  Uber  has  failed  in  its  initial  burden  of 
“demonstrating that an agreement to arbitrate was made” between Uber or Postmates and the

     B.     Grubhub Has Not Established that Any Agreement to Arbitrate Was Made 
           Grubhub “bears [the] initial burden” of establishing that the Platform Plaintiffs made 
an agreement to arbitrate claims against the company.”’  Grubhub has failed to satisfy its burden as 
to any plaintiff.” 
           First, Grubhub claims that the Platform Plaintiffs manifested assent to arbitrate based 
upon a purported “clickwrap” agreement.”  Yet, the Grubhub checkout page — where the Platform 
Plaintiffs allegedly manifested assent — does not require users to check a box or take any affirmative 
action indicating that they have assented to, let alone read, the Grubhub terms of use.*°  Rather, 
Grubhub alleges that the Platform Plaintiffs manifested assent by placing their orders on a page that 
states, in fine print, “[b]y placing your order you agree to Grubhub’s terms of use.”*'  The Second 
Circuit has held that this does not constitute a “clickwrap” agreement because “clicking “Place your 
order’  does  not  specifically  manifest  assent to the  additional terms,  for the purchaser is  not 
specifically asked whether she agrees or to say ‘I agree.’”*? Accordingly, Grubhub’s checkout page

           Grubhub’s terms of use provide that the terms are gcyverned by New York law. See Koreis

— as  described in the Koreis  Declaration — does  not constitute a “clickwrap”  agreement and 
Grubhub’s case law regarding such agreements is inapposite. 
           Second, Grubhub fails to provide sufficient evidence that Grubhub’s terms of use 
“were presented” to the Platform Plaintiffs “in a way that would put” them “on inquiry notice of such 
terms.”*? Grubhub submits “[s]creenshots depicting the Grubhub checkout page” for both its mobile 
application and website,™ but it does not specify which method the Platform Plaintiffs used to place 
orders. Most significantly, Grubhub has not provided sufficient evidence concerning what its app 
or web page looked like at the time the Platform Plaintiffs placed their orders.  Without that 
information, the Court cannot conclude that the Platform Plaintiffs were on constructive notice of 
the arbitration clause contained in Grubhub’s terms of use.*°

     85 
           To the extent that plaintiffs placed their orders on Grubhub’s website, rather than its mobile 
           application, Grubhub has failed to meet its initial burden also because — much like the 
           Amazon checkout page at issue in Nicosia — the link to Grubhub’s terms of use “is not bold, 
           capitalized, or conspicuous in ‘ight of the whole webpage.”  834 F.3d at 237.  Moreover, 
           there are “numerous other links on the webpage,” in addition to “multiple buttons” and 
           “sufficiently  distracting”  customer-  and  order-specific  information.  Jd.   Under  like 
           circumstances, the Second Circuit denied a motion to compel arbitration on the ground that 
           Amazon  “failed to  show that  [the plaintiff]  was on notice and  agreed to mandatory 
           arbitration as a matter of law.” Jd. at 238 (applying Washington law); compare id. at 241

           agreements looked like during the period when the plaintiffs would have actually seen 
           them.”). 

                                                                           23 
           Finally, Grubhub claims that it “emailed customers, including each plaintiff, to inform 
them of the updated Terms of Use.’*’  Grubhub submits a “true and correct copy of the email sent 
to customers to inform them of the  [December 2021] updated terms.”**  This email states that 
Grubhub had “made changes to . . . [its] dispute resolution and arbitration agreement, which explains 
how legal disputes are handled,” and notifies users, in bold and underlined text, that “continued use 
of Grubhub will confirm that you have reviewed and agreed to the updated Terms of Use... □□□ 
However, Grubhub has not submitted any evidence to demonstrate when this email was sent and 
whether it was successfully delivered to or opened by any plaintiff.°° Furthermore, in contrast to the 
cases it cited, Grubhub has not established that the Platform Plaintiffs assented to any prior iteration 
of Grubhub’s terms of use.  Accordingly, it has failed to demonstrate a course of dealing by which 
Platform Plaintiffs could be and have been on reasonable notice that updates to Grubhub’s terms of 
use would be communicated by email notices to the email address affiliated with each plaintiffs 
Grubhub account.”  In deciding defendants’ motions to compel, the Court must draw all reasonable

demonstrate that an agreement to arbitrate was made between the company and any plaintiff. 

Threshold Issue of Arbitrability 
     A,     The Enforceability of Uber’s Arbitration Clause Is an Issue for the Court 
           Given that Uber and Postmates have satisfied their initial burden as to plaintiffs Boisi, 
Davitashvili, Eliades, Obey, and Swaby, the Court must determine whether the threshold issue of 
arbitrability has been delegated exclusively to the arbitrator. 
           Section 2(a)(4) of Uber’s December 2021 terms of use provides in relevant part: 
           “Only an arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have 
           exclusive  authority  to  resolve  any  dispute  arising  out  of  or  relating  to  the 
           interpretation,  applicability,  enforceability,  or  formation  of  this  Arbitration 
           Agreement,  including without  limitation any claim that  all  or any part of this 
           Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  An arbitrator shall also have exclusive 
           authority to resolve all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to 
           whether the Terms are applicable, unconscionable, or illusory and any defense to 
           arbitration, including without limitation waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.”*° 
           This language clearly and unmistakably provides that “all threshold arbitrability 
issues,”  including  issues  of contract  formation  or  unconscionability,  will  be  decided  by  an

arbitrator."* However, as in Gingras v. Think Finance, Inc., plaintiffs “mount a convincing challenge 
to the arbitration clause itself,” and their opposition to Uber’s motion asserts that “[t]he delegation 
provision of the [December 2021 terms of use] is also [unconscionable].’””’ “That specific attack on 
the delegation provision is sufficient to make the issue of arbitrability one for a federal court” and 
thus the Court is “correct to decide it.””° 

     B.     Grubhub’s Terms of Use Expressly Delegate Arbitrability Issues to the Court 
           Even if Grubhub had established that the Platform Plaintiffs had assented to its terms 
of use, the issue of arbitrability would remain with the Court.  The Second Circuit instructs that “the 
issue of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a matter is to be decided by the courts and not the 
arbitrators,  ‘[u]nless  the  parties  clearly  and  unmistakably  provide  otherwise.’”’’   Grubhub’s 
arbitration  clause  states  that “issues  related to  the  scope,  validity,  and  enforceability  of this 
Arbitration Agreement are fora court to decide.”* Accordingly, the arbitrability of plaintiffs’ claims 
against Grubhub would be decided by the Court.

Defendants’  Infinite Arbitration Clauses Do Not Apply to Plaintiffs’ Claims 
           Defendants’ arbitration clauses are examples of a “‘relatively new and untested’ 
species of arbitration clause,’ which one scholar aptly has described as an “infinite arbitration 
clause.”!°° If enforced according to their terms, they would require arbitration of any claims between 
defendants  and the Platform Plaintiffs, including claims without any nexus to the  agreements 
containing the clauses — i.e., defendants’ terms of use.  In Smith v.  Steinkamp,  Judge Posner 
colorfully illustrated the “absurd results” that would ensue if a payday lender’s similarly broad 
arbitration clause were “read as standing free from any loan agreement.”'®’  For example, Judge 
Posner mused: 
           “if Instant Cash murdered [plaintiff] in order to discourage defaults and her survivors 
           brought a wrongful death suit against Instant Cash... , Instant Cash could insist that 
           the wrongful death claim be submitted to arbitration. For that matter, if an employee 
           of Instant Cash picked [plaintiffs] pocket when she came in to pay back the loan, and 
           [plaintiff] sued the employee for conversion, he would be entitled to arbitration of her 
           claim.  It would make no difference [if] the conversion had occurred in [plaintiff s]

           Since Smith, the Ninth Circuit and several district courts have declined to enforce 
“infinite arbitration clauses” where, as here, the claims at issue lacked any nexus to the agreement 
containing the clause.'®’  In this district, Judge Furman held as a matter of New York law that an 
arbitration clause substantially similar to those in defendants’ terms of use could not be applied to 
claims  without  a  nexus  to  the  underlying  agreement  as  a  matter  of contract  formation  and 
unconscionability.'"""  This Court concurs. 
           Plaintiffs’ claims are completely unrelated to their use of defendants’ platforms.  To 
the contrary, their claims specifically exclude any purchases made through defendants’ platforms and 
are based solely on purchases made directly from restaurants or from non-defendant meal-delivery 
platforms. The fact that the Platform Plaintiffs at some time used some of the defendants’ platforms 
is purely coincidental, as demonstrated by plaintiff Drewey who has well-plead claims despite never 
having used any of the defendants’ platforms.'®

contract would otherwise be unenforceable either in whole or in part,” courts “may as a matter of 
interpretation carry out the intention of [the] contract by transposing, rejecting, or supplying words 
to make the meaning of the contract more clear.”'®’ Applying these principles here, the Court reaches 
the same conclusion that the McFarlane, Revitch, and Wexler Courts reached: 
           “Notwithstanding the literal meaning of the clause’s language, no reasonable person 
           would think that’ agreeing to [defendants’ terms of use] ‘would obligate [him or her] 
           to arbitrate literally every possible dispute he or she might have with the service 
           provider, let alone all of [its] affiliates...  Rather, a reasonable person would be 
           expressing, at most, an intent to agree to arbitrate disputes connected in some way to 
           the [terms of use] agreement with [defendants].’”!™ 
           In the alternative, it would be unconscionable to enforce defendants’  arbitration 
clauses with respect to claims untethered to defendants’ respective terms of use.  Under New York 
law, “[a]n unconscionable contract has been defined as one which is so grossly unreasonable or 
unconscionable in the light of the mores and business practices of the time and place as to be 
unenforceable according to its literal terms.”'°’  Defendants’ arbitration clauses fall within this

definition.  If interpreted literally, they would produce grossly unreasonable outcomes that would 
contravene a reasonable person’s expectations.  For example,  according to their literal terms, 
defendants’ arbitration clauses would require a user of defendants’ platforms to arbitrate claims for 
securities fraud, personal injury, or wrongful termination that have nothing to do with the plaintiff's 
use of the platform.  Accordingly, “as a matter of general unconscionability doctrine, [defendants’ 
arbitration clauses] must be construed to apply only to claims that have some nexus to the contract 
of which it is part.”"”° 
           In sum, as a matter of either contract formation or unconscionability, the Court holds 
that defendants’ arbitration clauses do not apply to plaintiffs’ claims to the extent they lack any nexus 
to the underlying contracts —i.e., to the extent they are not brought by plaintiffs in their capacities 
as a current or former users of defendants’ platforms.''! 

Defendants’  Infinite Class Action Waivers Do Not Apply to Plaintiffs’ Claims 
           Defendants’ attempts to enforce their expansive class action waivers fail for the same 
reasons as do their infinite arbitration clauses. Defendants’ class action waivers purport to waive the 
Platform Plaintiffs’ right to seek class-wide relief with respect to any dispute between the parties, 
no matter how untethered it is to the defendants’ terms of use.  As set forth above, whether as a 
matter of contract formation or unconscionability, defendants cannot enforce such infinitely broad

LEWis A. KAPLAN, District Judge. 
        This putative class action involves the contractual relationships between restaurants 
and online platforms for restaurant meals.  The amended complaint alleges that three defendants — 
Grubhub, Inc. (“Grubhub”), Uber Technologies, Inc. “Uber” or “Uber Eats”), and Postmates Inc. 
(“Postmates’) (together, “Defendants”) — each unlawfully has fixed prices for restaurant meals by 
entering into restrictive agreements with restaurants that preclude those restaurants from charging 
lower prices off-platform, i.e., in the “direct” markets for restaurant meals and/or on other restaurant 
platforms. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants thus have caused them to pay artificially high prices for 
restaurant meals.’ They seek damages and injunctive relief under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and 
its state analogues on behalf of themselves and three nationwide classes of others similarly situated. 
        Before the Court is Defendants’ joint motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 
Defendants contend that the contracts at issue do not fix prices in a manner sufficient to state an 
antitrust claim.  For the following reasons, the motion is denied. 

                                Facts 
        The relevant facts alleged in the amended complaint are deemed true for purposes 
of this motion.  They are summarized as follows: 

        Am. Compl. (Dkt. 28) ff 1, 188-216.  All docket citations are to No. 20-cv-3000 (LAK). 

Background 
        Defendants operate electronic, internet based meal ordering platforms, which allow 
customers  to  order  restaurant  food  online.?   They  are  “two-sided platforms,  acting  as... 
intermediar[ies] to connect restaurants and consumers.’  Along with the rise of the internet, such 
platforms have become increasingly popular means of buying and selling restaurant food, especially 
since the early 2010s.‘  They aggregate the menus of participating restaurants within pick up or 
delivery range of the user and permit the user fo view and compare offerings before placing an order 
from a single restaurant.’  In exchange for their services, restaurant platforms collect commissions 
and fees on each transaction from both their restaurant and consumer customers.  At issue in this 
lawsuit is Defendants’ practice of imposing contractual “no price competition clauses” (“NPCCs”) 
on listed restaurants. All three Defendants’ NPCCs prevent their restaurant customers from charging 
lower list prices to consumers who dine in person or who order food takeout or delivery directly 
from the restaurant. Grubhub and Uber have more expansive NPCCs, which prevent their restaurant 
customers from charging lower prices to consumers who purchase their meals on rival restaurant 
platforms. 
        The amended complaint pleads four counts of vertical price fixing stemming from 
these arrangements.  Counts I and UI charge Defendants with unlawfully setting minimum prices
        Td.     25-28.
        Td. 436.
        Id. 492, 25.
        Id. §§ 25-28. 

in the local direct markets for restaurant meals (/.e., for dine-in meals and for meals for takeout and 
delivery coordinated through the restaurant).  Counts II and IV claim that defendants Grubhub and 
Uber similarly have set unlawful minimum prices throughout the restaurant platform market, both 
on the national and local levels. Because restaurant platform commissions force restaurants to raise 
their list prices to make money — or even break even — on each transaction, Plaintiffs allege that 
Defendants’  NPCCs have caused anticompetitive effects  in the relevant markets and harmed 
Plaintiffs directly by causing them to pay supracompetitive prices for restaurant meals. 

The Parties 
  A.     Plaintiffs 
        There are eight named plaintiffs in this case.  Each is a natural person who resides 
in and is  a citizen of the  State  of New York.®  Over the relevant period, plaintiffs Mariam 
Davitashvili, Adam Bensimon, and Mia Sapienza have ordered meals for “takeout, delivery, and 
dine-in directly from restaurants that sell their goods through Defendants’ platforms.”  Plaintiffs 
Phil Eliades and Jonathan Swaby have done the same, but also have ordered “indirectly from such 
restaurants through Doordash.”  Plaintiff John Boisi “has placed orders for takeout and dine-in 
directly from restaurants that sell their goods through Grubhub and Postmates, and indirectly from
        Id. F§ 10-17.
        Id. ff 10-12.
        Id. 99 13-14. 

such restaurants through Caviar and Doordash.”” Plaintiff Nate Obey “has placed orders for takeout 
and dine-in directly from restaurants that sell their goods through Grubhub, and indirectly from such 
restaurants through Caviar.”!”  Meanwhile, plaintiff Malik Drewey “has placed orders for takeout 
and dine-in directly from restaurants that sell their goods through each Defendant’s platform, but 
he has not used any of those platforms.” 
        Plaintiffs purport to represent three classes of similarly-situated consumers.  First, 
the Direct Takeout and Delivery Class, which “comprises all persons or entities in the United States 
who have purchased goods, for takeout or delivery by the restaurant, directly from a restaurant 
subject to any Defendant’s NPCC.””?  Second, the Dine-In Class which “comprises all persons or 
entities  in the United States who have purchased goods, for dining in the restaurant,  from a 
restaurant subject to any Defendant’s NPCC.”?  Third, the Restaurant Platform Class which 
“comprises all persons or entities in the United States who have purchased goods, through a non- 
Defendant Restaurant Platform, from a restaurant subject to Grubhub’s or Uber’s NPCCs.”""4

  B.     Defendants 
        Defendants Grubhub, Uber, and Postmates are horizontal competitors that operate 
platforms for restaurant takeout and delivery orders.  Each operates throughout the United States. 

The Relevant Markets 
        Plaintiffs have pleaded three separate product markets. First, they allege a Restaurant 
Platform Market in which Defendants compete for restaurant meal transactions.'*  Jn this market, 
consumers can “search for participating restaurants in a locality and order food for takeout and 
delivery, through the same platform from those restaurants.”'°  Second, Plaintiffs allege a Direct 
Takeout and Delivery Market, in which “a consumer may order directly from a restaurant for takeout 
or delivery by, for example, calling the restaurant’s phone number or by visiting the restaurant’s 
website.”!’  Third, they allege  a Dine-In Market, in which a consumer may order and eat a meal at 
a restaurant.'* 
        In addition, Plaintiffs plead both national and local geographic markets.  Plaintiffs’ 
alleged Restaurant Platform Market encompasses platform business throughout the United States. 
The Direct Takeout and Delivery Market and the Dine-In Market are inherently local because     

consumers realistically will order food from or visit only a restaurant that is relatively close by.

Plaintiffs allege also that Defendants compete locally in the Restaurant Platform Market, both for 
“listings from restaurants” and “delivery and takeout orders from consumers.”!” The local markets 
include New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Philadelphia, 
Atlanta, Boston, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.”” 

Market Shares 
        Four restaurant platforms —Doordash and Defendants Grubhub, Uber, and Postmates 

— account for 98 percent of the market for meals purchased through restaurant platforms in the 
United States.” As of November 2019, Doordash was the national leader with a market share of 37 
percent, while Defendants Grubhub, Uber, and Postmates held respective national market shares of 
31  percent, 20 percent, and  10 percent.”  Defendants’  local market shares vary by region, but 
Plaintiffs allege that each Defendant is dominant in at least one metropolitan area.  For example, 
Grubhub holds 67 percent of the restaurant platform market in New York City, Uber holds 55 
percent of the market in Miami, and Postmates holds 37 percent of the market in Los Angeles.’ In 
July 2020, it was announced that Uber would acquire Postmates.”*

        Id. 99121, 39. 

        Plaintiffs offer several explanations for this concentration.  Indirect network effects 
are at work in the restaurant platform markets because “the value that [the restaurant platforms] offer 
to one side of the platform is a function of the extent of the use of the other side of the platform.” 
In other words, a restaurant platform is more attractive to a given user if it lists many restaurants and 
more valuable to a given restaurant if it is used by many prospective customers.  Indirect network 
effects thus reinforce the dominant positions of the few platforms that can offer access to the largest 
networks of restaurants and consumers.  This might explain also why the platforms “split their 
dominance regionally,” with one restaurant platform usually dominant in cach metropolitan area.” 
Restaurant platforms are also “sticky,” meaning consumers — for a variety of reasons, including 
familiarity and convenience ~ are unlikely to switch platforms.”’  In addition, as explained below, 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ anticompetitive conduct contributes to their market dominance by 
preventing restaurants and other restaurant platforms from competing with them on price. 

Commissions and Fees 
        In exchange for connecting restaurants to consumers, restaurant platforms charge 
commissions and fees on both sides of each transaction.”  First, the platforms charge a restaurant 
commission, which is typically calculated as a certain rate multiplied by the total price of the 

  25

customer’s order plus any delivery fee charged by the restaurant.””  According to the amended 
complaint, Defendants typically charge a 30 percent commission rate to restaurants that do not 
provide their own delivery and a lower rate to restaurants that do provide their own delivery. 
        Second, restaurant platforms charge service fees to the consumer. Like the restaurant 
commission, the service fee is generally equal to a rate multiplied by the total list price of the 
customer’s order. Plaintiffs allege that the service fee is typically between 5 percent and 10 percent, 
but they concede that in certain cases — including for pick up orders and cases in which the 
restaurant does its own delivery — no service fee is charged.”° 
        Third, the platforms generally charge a 5 percent delivery fee to customers in cases 
where the restaurant uses the platform’s delivery services.*! 
        Plaintiffs  contend  that  these  rates  are  supracompetitive.   Defendants’  current 
commission rates — at least, when the platform is providing delivery — are “triple what they were in 
2004 and almost double what they were in 2015.”  Other platforms provide the same services at 
lower rates.*  Plaintiffs point to Defendants’ alleged market power and indirect network effects as

the primary economic reasons why Defendants are able to impose rates which, according to one 
survey, 90 percent of restaurants have deemed subjectively “unreasonable.”” 

The Alleged Restraints 
        At the heart of this dispute is Plaintiffs’ allegation that each of these defendants 
requires each restaurant listed on its platform to enter into a restrictive agreement — an NPCC — 
which prevents the restaurant from offering the same menu items directly to consumers or, in some 
cases, on other restaurant platforms at a lower price than the restaurant charges on the defendant’s 
platform.** A “narrow” NPCC prohibits the product’s sale at a lower price only when the restaurant 
sells to consumers directly.° A “wide” NPCC prohibits restaurants from selling products anywhere 
at a price lower than that charged on the restaurant platform in question.  This includes prices for 
direct sales and on other restaurant platforms.*” 
        Postmates imposes a narrow NPCC that requires restaurants that use its platform to 
maintain “price parity between in-store and online menus.”**  This means that 
        “any restaurant that sells goods through Postmates is contractually prohibited from 
        selling those goods at a lower price to consumers who purchase directly from that 
        restaurant, regardless of whether the meal is for takeout, delivery, or dine-in, and 
        regardless of whether that meal was ordered online, by phone, or in person.  The

        restaurant may, however, charge a lower price when it sells its goods through a 
        competing platform, such as Doordash.””” 
Grubhub and Uber, however, both impose wide NPCCs that prohibit restaurants from selling meals 
at lower prices “through any competing restaurant platform” or through direct orders placed by 
consumers.”  Grubhub’s NPCC states that 
        “(tlhe item pricing must be at least as favorable to the consumer as that which is 
        available for Restaurant’s standard menu or offered to any 3rd party service,’ 
and Uber’s NPCC provides that a 
         “Merchant may not make any Item available to Customers through the [Uber] Eats 
        App at a price that is higher than the price that Merchant charges in-store for similar 
        Items .. . [nor] at a price higher than the amount Merchant is charging for similar 
        Items through any comparable platform for food delivery services.” 
Plaintiffs note that DoorDash, the market leader, does not impose an NPCC on restaurants that sell 
on its platform.  Instead, it allows restaurants to “increase prices on that platform to offset the 
delivery app’s commission fees, without increasing the in-house restaurant list price.” 
        Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ NPCCs are designed to inhibit competition and in 
fact have significant anticompetitive effects.  Restaurants make very low profit margins, usually

below 15 percent. This means that a restaurant typically must make a high volume of sales to stay 
afloat.  It means also that restaurants cannot realistically forgo listing their menus on Defendants’ 
platforms, even though restaurant commission rates — which can reach up to 30 percent — are likely 
to swallow most restaurants’ profits. 
        The platforms’ reach is hard to overstate.  Restaurant platforms now capture 80 
percent of online orders for meal delivery.” Millions of customers order food through one or more 
platforms.**  And because restaurant platforms are “sticky” and many consumers use only one 
platform, most restaurants contract with multiple platforms in order to reach as many potential 
customers as possible.*”  Defendants are the second, third, and fourth largest restaurant platforms 
nationally and each dominates at least one of the local markets.  Accordingly, it is exceedingly 
difficult for restaurants to avoid being bound by Defendants’ NPCCs. And once they are so bound, 
restaurants cannot lower their list prices — either for direct purchases or on platforms that charge 
lower commissions or fees — in order to offset the costs they incur on Defendants’ platforms.  Given 
these pressures, it makes sense that restaurants have been forced to raise prices to counteract 
Defendants’ high commission rates.

Legal Standard 
        A,     Motion to Dismiss 
        To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure  12(b)(6), a complaint must allege sufficient facts to “state a claim to relief that is 
plausible on its face.’"* “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiffpleads factual content that 
allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct 
alleged.’  The Court accepts as true all factual allegations made in the complaint, but does not 
credit “mere conclusory statements” nor “threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action.””” 
The Court considers also any documents attached to the complaint or incorporated therein by 
reference.”

of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States.””’

“A violation of Section  1  generally requires a combination or other form of concerted action 
between two legally distinct entities resulting in an unreasonable restraint on trade.”? 
         Combinations, conspiracies and agreements “formed for the purpose and with the 
effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity” commonly 
are referred to as price-fixing arrangements.’  Agreements between or among competitors are 
characterized as “horizontal” while those between or among entities at different levels of distribution 

— e.g, manufacturer and wholesaler or wholesaler and retailer — are referred to as “vertical.” 
Horizontal restraints on competition — notably but not exclusively price fixing — are unlawful per 
se.  Vertical restraints, including resale price restraints, are evaluated according to the rule of 
reason.’ As plaintiffs contend that Defendants’ NPCCs are vertical price-fixing arrangements, they 
come under the rule of reason.  So we come to the question of what is required in order to state a 
legally sufficient claim. 
        Asa  general matter, a private plaintiff bringing a claim under the Sherman Act must 
“(1) define the relevant market, (2) allege an antitrust injury, and (3) allege conduct in violation of 
the antitrust laws.®  So here Plaintiffs must allege facts which, assuming their truth and drawing

from them all reasonable and favorable inferences, would suffice to permit a fnding of relevant 
matket or markets and an antitrust injury.  In order to satisfy the requirement of pleading conduct 
in violation of the antitrust laws, they must allege also the concerted action essential to stating a 
Sherman Act Section 1 claim, which they obviously have done by alleging Defendants’ agreements 
with restaurants, and that Defendants’ conduct otherwise violates the antitrust laws. 

              □□     Market Definition 
        A plaintiff bringing a claim under the rule of reason must plead facts that plausibly 
support its proposed definition of the relevant market.°’ A relevant market has two components: a 
relevant product and a relevant geographic scope.°*  The boundaries of the alleged product market 
must be rationally related to an “analysis of the interchangeability of use or the cross-elasticity of 
demand.”*” A geographic market is normally the geographic “area of effective competition,” which 
courts measure “by determining the areas in which the seller operates and where consumers can turn, 
as a practical matter, for supply of the relevant product.”  Market definition is a “deeply fact-

              2.     Anticompetitive Effects 
        In rule of reason cases, the legality of a challenged restraint ultimately — i.e,  on 
summary judgment or at trial — is evaluated in accordance with a three-step  burden-shifting 
framework. 
              “First, a plaintiff bears the initial burden of demonstrating that a defendant’s 
        challenged behavior ‘had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the 
        relevant  market.’  Capital  Imaging,  996  F.2d  at  543.  Examples  of  actual 
        anticompetitive   effects   include  reduced   output,   decreased   quality,   and 
        supracompetitive pricing. See Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d at 96; Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d 
        at 546-47. 
              “Tf the plaintiff cannot establish anticompetitive effects directly by showing 
        an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole within the relevant market, he or 
        she nevertheless may establish anticompetitive effects indirectly by showing that the 
        defendant has ‘sufficient market power to cause an adverse effect on competition.’ 
        Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d at 96; see also K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. Walker Mfg. 
        Co.,  61  F.3d  123,  129  (2d  Cir.  1995)  (”[W]here  the  plaintiff is  unable  to 
        demonstrate [an actual adverse effect on competition,] .. . it must at least establish 
        that defendants possess the requisite market power’ and thus the capacity to inhibit 
        competition market-wide.’ (quoting Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 546)).  Because 
        ‘[m|arket power is but a “surrogate for detrimental effects,”’  Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d 
        at 96 (quoting FTC v. Ind. ked’n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 461, 106 S.Ct. 2009, 90 
        L.Ed.2d 445  (1986)),  ‘[a] plaintiff seeking to use market power as a proxy for 
        adverse effect must show market power, plus some other ground for believing that 
        the challenged behavior could harm competition in the market, such as the inherent 
        anticompetitive nature of the defendant’s behavior or the structure of the interbrand 
        market,’ id, at 97,

              “Once the plaintiff satisfies its initial burden to prove anticompetitive effects, 
        the burden shifts to the defendant to offer evidence of any procompetitive effects of 
        the restraint at issue. See Geneva Pharms.|Tech. Corp. v. Barr Lab’ys. Inc.,386 F.3d 
        485, 507 (2d Cir. 2004)].  Ifthe defendant can provide such proof, then ‘the burden 
        shifts back to the plaintiff] ] to prove that any legitimate competitive benefits offered 
        by defendant{[ ] could have been achieved through less restrictive means.’ fd. (citing 
        Capital Imaging, 996 F.2d at 543). 
But at the pleading stage, only the first step of this framework is material, as consideration of alleged 
procompetitive  effects  of  defendants’  actions  and  the  ultimate  judgment  of  whether  any 
procompetitive  effects  “outweigh”  any  anticompetitive  effects  is  inappropriate  on  a  motion 
addressed to the sufficiency of the complaint.“ As Judge Rakoff aptly has put it when a defendant 
opposed a motion to dismiss a rule of reason antitrust claim on the basis that its actions had 
procompetitive benefits: 
              “Defendant  counters  that  [it]  provides  many  pro-competitive  benefits 
        [citation omitted] and also disputes the conclusions that plaintiff purports to draw 
        from the .  .  . studies  [plaintiff cited].  [Citation omitted]  Defendant’s counter- 
        assertions, while certainly worth a fact-finder’s consideration, do not persuade the 
        Court to grant a motion to dismiss.  The Court hence determines that plaintiff has 
        plausibly pleaded adverse effects in the relevant market.  Consequently, the Court 
        finds that plaintiff has presented a plausible claim of a vertical conspiracy under 
        Section 1 of the Sherman Act.”®

        3.     Antitrust Standing 
        Section 4 of the Clayton Act creates a private cause of action for damages under the 
antitrust laws, including Section 1 of the Sherman Act.®*  Section provides also for injunctive relief 
“against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws.””’  A private plaintiff who 
brings a case under these provisions, in addition to pleading adeqautely the other elements of his or 
her claim, must plead constitutional standing under Article II and antitrust standing.” 
        Defendants have not challenged Plaintiffs’ Article HI standing on this motion to 
dismiss.   Nor  do  they  argue  explicitly  that  Plaintiffs  lack  antitrust  standing  to  bring  suit. 
Nonetheless, because the principles of antitrust standing underlie Defendants’ arguments regarding 
Plaintiffs’ purported failure to plead antitrust injury in the relevant markets, the Court will briefly 
explain the law that governs its analysis. 
        Courts evaluating antitrust standing must determine that a plaintiff plausibly has 
alleged (a) injury in fact, (b) antitrust injury, and (c) that he or she is an acceptable plaintiff to pursue 
the violation, or, in other words, that he or she would be an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws.”

        See 15 U.S.C. § 26. 
        Unlike Section 4, which in general requires a private plaintiff to prove actual loss in order 
        to recover damages, a plaintiff seeking injunctive relief under Section  16 “need only 
        demonstrate a significant threat of injury from an impending violation of the antitrust laws 
        or from a contemporary violation likely to continue or recur.”  Zenith Radio Corp. v.

        In deciding whether the plaintiff has pleaded antitrust injury, the Second Circuit 
requires that we 
        “employ a three-step process for determining whether a plaintiff has sufficiently 
        alleged antitrust injury. First, the party asserting that it has been injured by an illegal 
        anticompetitive practice must ‘identify[] the practice complained of and the reasons 
        such a practice is or might be anticompetitive.’  Port Dock [& Stone  Corp.  v. 
        Oldcastle Ne., Inc., 507 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir. 2007)]. Next, we identify the ‘actual 
        injury the plaintiff alleges.’  Id.  This requires us to look to the ways in which the 
        plaintiff claims it is in a ‘worse position’  as a consequence of the defendant’s 
        conduct.  Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 486 (1977). 
        Finally, we ‘compar[e]’ the ‘anticompetitive effect of the specific practice at issue’ 
        to ‘the actual injury the plaintiff alleges.’  Port Dock, 507 F.3d at 122.  It is not 
        enough  for the  actual  injury to  be  ‘causally linked’  to  the  asserted  violation. 
        Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489 ....  Rather, in order to establish antitrust injury, the 
        plaintiff must demonstrate that its injury is ‘of the type the antitrust laws were 
        intended to  prevent  and that  flows  from  that  which  makes  [or  might  make] 
        defendants’ acts unlawful.’  Daniel [v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408, 
        438 (2d Cir. 2005)] (internal quotation marks omitted).”” 
In addition, the plaintiff must allege plausibly that he or she would be an efficient enforcer of the 
antitrust laws.  On this point we consider 
        “(1) the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; (2) the existence of an 
        identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to 
        vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement; (3) the speculativeness of the 
        alleged injury; and (4) the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them 
        among direct and indirect victims so as to avoid duplicative recoveries.” 
□□ weight to be given these various factors will necessarily vary with the circumstances of 
particular cases.””

        Finally, in addressing both antitrust injury and whether a plaintiff is an efficient 
enforcer of the antitrust laws, “a court must analyze whether a plaintiffs alleged injury constitutes 
injury to the competitive process ....””  The general rule is that “only those that are participants 
in the defendants’ market can be said to have suffered antitrust injury.””? This makes intuitive sense. 
Competitors and consumers have the clearest connection to a given defendant’s anticompetitive 
conduct because they unlawfully may be forced to pay higher prices for the defendant’s goods or 
services, deprived of their own business opportunities, or excluded from the market.  But, as 
explained in more detail below, others who are injured as a result of anticompetitive conduct may 
also have standing to sue.” 

Sufficiency of Relevant Market Allegations 
        Defendants areue that Plaintiffs have failed plausibly to allege the relevant markets. 
They challenge the distinctions among Plaintiffs’ alleged product markets, arguing that they “fail 
to plausibly suggest that ordering from a restaurant (or a restaurant receiving an order) is not a 
substitute for ordering the same meal from a restaurant (or a restaurant receiving an order) via 
Defendants’ platforms.”  This argument is without merit for purposes of this motion.

        The Supreme Court recently held that “[o |nly other two-sided platforms can compete 
with a two-sided platform for transactions.””’  Even if this did not settle the matter, Plaintiffs have 
pleaded facts adequately supporting the separate product markets. 
        Defendants contend that the cross-elasticity “between and among orders placed on 
platforms and direct delivery” dooms Plaintiffs’ proposed market definition.”  Plaintiffs correctly 
point out that Defendants’ argument on this point fails to account for the so-called Cellophane 
fallacy.”  But perhaps more importantly, the pertinent question is not whether there are any cross- 
elasticities at all between the separate markets, but whether the cross-elasticity of demand is 
sufficient to require viewing the purportedly separate markets as a single, unified market.”  Given 
the fact-intensive nature of this inquiry, courts, perhaps especially at the pleading stage, look also 
to “practical indicia” of the relevant market, including “industry or public recognition .. . , the 
product’s peculiar characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct 
prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.””’ 

        Delivery Market and the Dine-In Market.  Even if they had, the Court is inclined to agree 
        with Plaintiffs that a meal at a restaurant is not an interchangeable substitute for a takeout

        These practical  indicia support separate treatment for the proposed Restaurant 
Platform Market for substantially the reasons that Plaintiffs suggest.  The amended complaint 
alleges plausibly that restaurant platforms “provide a service distinct from a restaurant’s website or 

app (e.g.,  a Domino’s pizza app)” first and foremost because they aggregate the offerings of many 
restaurants in one place.” They also provide functionalities that restaurants do not, including search, 
the  ability to  write  and read  reviews,  and  automated  recommendations  based  on the  user’s 
“preferences and other consumer reviews.”  Restaurant platforms are “especially popular” with 
urban young professionals, “a distinct group of consumers with distinct preferences,”**  And 
industry analysts have characterized the Restaurant Platform Market as a separate market, indeed, 
characterizing it as “an oligopoly and calling for antitrust scrutiny,” 
        Moreover, Defendants’ cited cases to the contrary are inapposite.  While it indeed 

may be true that courts “have not hesitated to define separate markets based on how the same 
product reached the consumer,” it does not follow that this Court therefore should decline to find 
well-pleaded Plaintiffs’ alleged separate product markets for restaurant platform services and meals 
purchased directly from a restaurant.  For example, the holding that “print books are an obvious 
substitute for e-books” in Bookhouse of Stuyvesant Plaza, Ine. v. Amazon.com, Inc. * would be

persuasive if, instead of comparing print books to e-books, the Court had found print books an 
obvious substitute for online book platforms. 
        Plaintiffs’ allegations of national and local Restaurant Platform Markets also are 
sufficient. Defendants contend that the national market is implausible because they do not “compete 
for transactions” on a national basis.*’  But the facts alleged suggest that Defendants do compete 
nationally,  and  courts  have recognized the  existence  of national  markets  even when market 
participants in some sense operate locally.**  Defendants allegedly “compete to build a national 
network of consumers to offer restaurants, and a national network to offer consumers.” They also 
advertise, operate, charge the same commissions to restaurants and consumers, provide the same 
services on their websites and mobile apps, and impose the same NPCCs throughout the country.” 
They compete also for partnerships with national restaurant chains.” 
        New York v. Deutsche Telekom AG” is instructive.  There the parties agreed on a 
national market for retail mobile wireless communications services, but disagreed over the existence 
of separate local markets.  The court determined that both geographic markets were present.

        Plaintiffs analogize Defendants’ conduct to that at issue in Leegin Creative Leather 
Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.,°° in which Leegin, a leather goods manufacturer, imposed minimum 
resale  prices  on retailers  that  sold  its  products.   The  Supreme  Court held that this  type  of 
arrangement is subject to the rule of reason and offered certain considerations that may render 
vertical price restraints anticompetitive.  They include whether the restraints are imposed by the 
retailer  rather  than  by  the  manufacturer,  whether  the  retailer’s  market  power  is  such  that 
manufacturers cannot avoid them by “sell[ing] their goods through rival retailers,” whether the 
restraint would prevent rival retailers “with better distribution systems and lower cost structures 

.. from charging lower prices,” and whether a large proportion of manufacturers is bound by the 
restraint or restraints.” 
        Although  Plaintiffs’  comparison  of  retailers  to  restaurant  platforms  and 
manufacturers to restaurants is somewhat strained, the facts Plaintiffs allege in support of their 
Leegin  analysis  paint  a plausible  picture  of the  anticompetitive  effects  allegedly  caused  by 
Defendants’ NPCCs.  The NPCCs were propounded by Defendants,”* who are not retailers but 
nonetheless consolidate and offer to their customers products from wide arrays of restaurants. 
Defendants therefore allegedly hold power over restaurants comparable to that which a  retailer 
might wield over a manufacturer in the sense that both Defendants and a theoretical retailer serve 

as conduits through which the restaurant or manufacturer can offer its goods to consumers.  The 
amended complaint also alleges plausibly that restaurants cannot feasibly avoid doing business with

Defendants because restaurants need access to the platforms’ customers — many of whom use only 
one platform due to platform “stickiness” — in order to generate sufficient sales to make up for their 
low margins.”  The NPCCs explicitly prevent restaurants from selling their goods at lower prices 
through “distribution systems with lower cost structures,” i.e., in the direct markets, where costs are 
lower because no commission rates are added to the list prices of restaurant meals.'’ And Plaintiffs 
have pleaded facts supporting the proposition that “one or more Defendants’ NPCCs restrain[s] 
more than half of the Direct Markets.”"°! 
        All  of this,  together  with  Plaintiffs’  well-pleaded  allegation  that  Defendants’ 
commission rates match or exceed most restaurants’  profit margins,  supports the  reasonable 
inference that restaurants — being foreclosed from lowering prices in the direct markets to attract 
sales — have had no choice but to raise prices in both the platform and direct markets.  Plaintiffs’ 
anecdotal and survey evidence permits an inference or conclusion that restaurant owners have done 
just that.’

  B.     Antitrust Standing 
        In order to bring their claims under Counts I and III, Plaintiffs must plead facts that 
allege plausibly that the direct classes have sustained antitrust injury and that they are acceptable 
plaintiffs to pursue the violation.’ Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded 
antitrust injury on behalf of the direct classes because any injury they suffered by purchasing meals 
at supracompetitive prices in the direct markets cannot be traced to Defendants’ conduct in the 
Restaurant Platform Market. According to Defendants, this is fatal because “a challenged restraint 
must harm competition in a market in which defendants compete.” But in Blue Shield of Virginia 
v. McCready,'® the Supreme Court held that the antitrust laws protect “parties whose injuries are 
‘inextricably intertwined’ with the injuries of market participants.”!”° 
        The McCready case arose from an alleged conspiracy entered into by Blue Shield and 
an association of psychiatrists to make psychologists ineligible for compensation for the provision 
of psychotherapy under Blue Shield’s health insurance plans.  Plaintiff, an individual who was 
covered by Blue Shield health insurance, sued after her requests that Blue Shield reimburse her for 
a psychologists services were denied.  The district court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss 
because, in its view, McCready’s injury “was tof[o] indirect and remote to be considered “antitrust

injury.’”!°’  The Court of Appeals reversed and the Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the 
plaintiff had antitrust standing because, despite being neither a competitor nor a direct customer of 
Blue Shield or its coconspirators (her employer purchased the insurance coverage on the group 
market, and she did not participate in the market for psychiatric services), she sustained antitrust 
injury when she was forced to pay for psychotherapy that would have been reimbursable absent 
defendants’ anticompetitive conduct." 
        The Court emphasized that the plain language and policy underlying Section 4 of the 
Clayton Act made clear that the statute “provides a remedy to ‘[a]ny person’ injured “by reason of 
anything prohibited by the antitrust laws.”'?  Section 4 nonetheless may not apply in cases that 
present the danger of “duplicative recovery” or when the injury is “too remote” to be proximately 
caused by the violation at issue.  But the Court found no potential for duplicative recovery in 
McCready’s case because she already had paid the psychologist, and her injury was not too remote 
because it was “clearly foreseeable” to the alleged conspirators and, in fact, was “a necessary step 
in effecting the ends of the alleged illegal conspiracy.”"!° McCready’s alleged injury therefore was 
“inextricably intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict on psychologists and the 
psychotherapy market,” and cognizable under the antitrust laws.'"'

        The Second Circuit has applied and reaffirmed the McCready rule in various cases, 
In Crimpers Promotions Inc. v. Home Box Office, Inc.,'"* the Second Circuit held that an organizer 
who  claimed the defendant coordinated a boycott of its trade  shows  in  order to prevent the 
defendant’s suppliers and competitors from meeting and transacting business suffered antitrust 
injury.  The Court noted that,  like Blue  Shield and the  organization of psychiatrists harmed 
McCready in order to harm the psychologists, HBO destroyed plaintiff's trade show as a “means to 
eliminate [its] competition.”!?  And in Jn re Aluminum Antitrust Litigation,'" the Second Circuit 
agreed that “the thrust of McCready is that the plaintiff was a participant in ‘the very market directly 
distorted by the antitrust violation.’”'’? The “upshot” is that “sometimes the defendant will corrupt 
a separate market in order to achieve its illegal ends, in which case the injury suffered can be said 
to be ‘inextricably intertwined’ with the injury of the ultimate target.’””’” 
        The amended complaint alleges plausibly that the direct classes’ injuries in the direct 
markets  similarly  are  “inextricably  intertwined”  with  Defendants’  allegedly  unlawful 
anticompetitive conduct in the Restaurant Platform Market.  Plaintiffs plead that Defendants’ 
NPCCs were designed to restrict competition that could result from restaurants offering lower prices

in the direct markets.  Defendants allegedly force consumers to pay supracompetitive prices in the 
direct markets as a “means to eliminate competition” that would threaten their business. '"” 
        Thus, the Court holds that the direct classes have adequately alleged facts thatsupport 
their claims against Defendants.  They plausibly have alleged antitrust injury under the Second 
Circuit’s  three-step  analysis.’  They  identify  Defendants’  imposition  of NPCCs  as  vertical 
restraints of trade in violation of the Sherman Act, and they allege actual injury in the form of 
suptacompetitive prices.  This injury is “of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and 
flows from that which makes defendants’ acts unlawful.”!!?  The Court holds also that the direct 
classes would be efficient enforcers of the antitrust laws.  The injury they sustained by paying 
supracompetitive prices was direct.  Their interest in obtaining damages and/or injunctive relief 
against Defendants’ anticompetitive practices likely would motivate them to pursue enforcement. 
Their alleged  injury is not impermissibly speculative,  and there  is  no  danger  of duplicative 
recoveries to direct and indirect victims, as Plaintiffs are the direct victims of the alleged restraint 
and have already paid for their meals.

  A.     Anticompetitive Effects 
        We begin by examining Plaintiffs’  allegations of anticompetitive effects in the 
Restaurant Platform Market  stemming from  Grubhub  and Uber’s  “wide” NPCCs,  which  set 
minimum prices anywhere restaurants sell meals, including on other restaurant platforms. The Court 
is persuaded by Plaintiffs’ contention that the amended complaint sufficiently pleads direct evidence 
of anticompetitive effects in the platform market.  Because this is a two-sided transaction market, 
Plaintiffs must allege anticompetitive effects resulting from the challenged restraint both for the 
Defendants’ consumer and restaurant customers.'”! 
        The amended complaint alleges plausibly that Grubhub and Uber’s NPCCs create 
supracompetitive prices for consumers.  The distinction here is between restaurant list prices and 
platform commissions.  Wide NPCCs prevent restaurants from offering lower list prices on other 
platforms.  Because these list prices allegedly are “a key (and, in some cases, the only) component 
of the end-price paid by customers for goods ordered through Restaurant Platforms,”'”’ it is plausible 
that Grubhub and Uber’s conduct prevents restaurants from charging lower prices through less 
expensive channels of distribution.”  It is reasonable to infer that the list prices consumers pay for 
platform orders are supracompetitive.'*

        Defendants’  papers  understandably  highlight  competition  by  other  restaurant 
platforms.  But despite challenges by new entrants and Doordash’s  position as the largest platform 
in the national market, Grubhub and Uber are alleged to have continued to raise their commission 
rates over time.  According to its SEC filings, Grubhub’s commission rate increased 156 percent 
between 2014 and 2019.'%  Plaintiffs allege that both Grubhub and Uber make profit margins of 
between 40 percent and 80 percent, depending on whether or not the restaurant provides its own 
delivery.'"® The Court does not decide whether Defendants have raised their rates and become more 
profitable because of improved services to customers or because of their alleged anticompetitive 
conduct. At the pleading stage, courts “may not pick and choose among plausible explanations” for 
these effects.’?” 
        In addition to supracompetitive prices, Plaintiffs allege plausibly that consumer 
choice has decreased due to Grubhub and Uber’s NPCCs. High restaurant commission rates — which 
“flow” from the NPCCs— allegedly make it impossible for restaurants to “offer lower-margin items 
through Defendants’ platforms.”  Plaintiffs plead also that these restraints shield Grubhub and

Uber  from  competitive  pressures  to  improve  their technology’  and  offer  quality  customer 
service,” 
        Plaintiffs plead facts that support their claim that these anticompetitive effects are 
felt throughout the relevant markets. Because the NPCCs allegedly bind all restaurants that list their 
menus on Grubhub and Uber regardless of what volume of transactions they do on each platform, 
the relevant metric through which to assess the agreements’ impact is how many restaurants in each 
market are listed on the platforms.  Plaintiffs plead ample facts suggesting that very large numbers 
of  restaurants  are  listed  on  Grubhub  and  Uber,  at  both  the  national  and  local  levels. 
“(Alpproximately 77  [percent]  of all restaurants in the United States that offer delivery do so 
through Grubhub, and more than a quarter... do so through Uber and Postmates.”'*'  “[MlJore than 
half of the restaurants in each Local Market... are on Grubhub.”'*?  And for the local markets for 
which Uber data is available, the lowest percentage of total restaurants on Uber is 19 percent in Los 
Angeles, and in San Francisco it reaches 93 percent.'”  Plaintiffs contend that these percentages

would be even higher in a sample of restaurants that included only restaurants that list their products 
on restaurant platforms.’ 
        Plaintiffs  also  plead  direct  evidence  of harm  to  restaurants  in  the  form  of 
supracompetitive prices. For much the same reasons as described above, it is plausible that Grubhub 
and Uber’s NPCCs both discourage rival restaurant platforms from offering lower commissions and 
allow Grubhub and Uber cover to raise their own rates.  And because of indirect network effects, 
platform “stickiness,” and the restaurants’ need to access as many potential customers as possible 
in order to stay in business, it is reasonable to infer that restaurants have no choice but to accept 
Grubhub and Uber’s NPCCs. 

  B.     Antitrust Standing 
        Defendants have not challenged Plaintiffs’ antitrust standing to bring suit on behalf 
of the Restaurant Platform Class against Grubhub and Uber on Counts If and IV.  But the Court 
addresses the issue for the sake of completeness.  Plaintiffs who have purchased meals from 
restaurant platforms in the relevant markets are alleged to have suffered injury in fact and antitrust 
injury because they paid supracompetitive prices — an injury “of the type the antitrust laws were 
intended to prevent and that flows from” defendants’ unlawful acts'*’ — due to Grubhub and Uber’s 
unlawful restraints.  The amended complaint alleges plausibly also that Plaintiffs are likely to be 
efficient enforcers of the antitrust laws because they suffered direct pecuniary injury that will

motivate them “to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement,”! their injury is concrete 
rather than speculative, and Plaintiffs’ status as direct victims of the unlawful restraint who have 
already paid for the products at issue would likely mitigate any potential for duplicative recoveries. 
        The Court, having concluded that Plaintiffs plausibly have alleged claims under 
Counts IT and IV, considers Defendants’ arguments in favor of dismissing Plaintiffs’ state law 
claims under Counts I and IV. 

State Law Antitrust Claims 
        In Counts IT] and IV, Plaintiffs allege state law antitrust violations under the laws of 
32 states and U.S. territories.'*” Defendants contend that these claims should be dismissed because 
Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under the Sherman Act, their “pleading is completely devoid 
of any allegations concerning 26 of the jurisdictions under whose laws they purport to sue,” and 
Plaintiffs “have not sufficiently alleged that they can bring a claim in their individual capacities for 
violation of any of the state laws listed in Counts ID] and IV.”"8 
        Defendants’ first argument fails because the Court holds that Plaintiffs have plausibly 
alleged their federal claims,  And Defendants’ additional arguments misapprehend the law.  The 
amended complaint alleges unlawful activity in every relevant jurisdiction, and indeed throughout
