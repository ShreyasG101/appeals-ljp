outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Sunoco, Inc. (R&M) and Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals L.P.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Sunoco argued that the district court erred in certifying the class under Rule 23(b)(3) because individualized issues regarding each owner’s marketable title and other individualized questions overwhelmed common issues, so predominance was not satisfied.

  2. Sunoco contended that the class was not ascertainable because not all class members could be identified from Sunoco’s records, and urged adoption of an ''administrative feasibility'' requirement that it claimed was not met.

  3. Sunoco asserted that several unidentified class members, particularly those whose payments were sent to state unclaimed property funds and whose names were not known, lacked Article III standing, and that this standing defect undermined the validity of the class action.

  4. Sunoco argued that the district court improperly allowed recovery of statutory interest as ''prejudgment interest'' beyond what Oklahoma law permits, contending that under the PRSA interest should stop accruing once the late proceeds are paid, and that the court unlawfully allowed interest to accrue through the date of the trial opinion/judgment.

  5. Sunoco further contended that the Energy Litigation Reform Act (ELRA) limits recoverable damages to the interest provided by the PRSA and precludes any ''extra-statutory'' prejudgment interest beyond what the PRSA authorizes, arguing that the district court’s interest award violated that limitation.

  6. Sunoco argued that the district court erred in awarding $75 million in punitive damages because punitive damages are not available for a PRSA claim, which it characterized as a breach-of-contract claim under Oklahoma law, and because Oklahoma’s punitive damages statute bars punitive damages for obligations arising from contract.

  7. Sunoco also argued that, even under the ELRA, punitive damages were not authorized on the facts found, asserting that the statutory standard for punitive damages in late-payment cases was not satisfied.

  8. In challenging class certification more broadly, Sunoco argued that the presence of individualized affirmative defenses, including its marketable-title defense, defeated predominance and rendered the class action unmanageable.

  9. Sunoco argued that some class members had intra-class conflicts (e.g., due to indemnity agreements) and that issues such as determining the date of first sale undermined the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a), thereby making class certification improper.'
