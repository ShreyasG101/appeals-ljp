outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Local 14A, Rochester Regional Joint Board, Xerographic Division Workers United''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. The Union argued that the district court erred in concluding that the language in the 2018–21 CBA and incorporated plan documents could not be reasonably interpreted as guaranteeing vested retiree benefits beyond the contract’s expiration or as constituting deferred compensation.

  2. The Union contended that the survivor benefits’ clause and other provisions in the plan documents, which state that plan participation ''shall continue ... until his or her death,'' could be reasonably understood as promising vested benefits beyond the contract’s duration.

  3. The Union argued that the pre-65 ''Benefits Allowance'' provision in the CBA was fixed under the contract but as yet unsatisfied, and thus constituted deferred compensation that vested during the term of the CBA.

  4. The Union asserted that the reservation-of-rights clause in the plan documents did not conclusively bar an interpretation that benefits had vested, because the CBA is an independent source of retiree benefits and employer contributions to those benefits.

  5. The Union claimed that the district court’s entry of declaratory judgment was procedurally improper.'
