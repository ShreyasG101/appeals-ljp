ALVIN K. HELLERSTEIN, U.S.D.J.: 
           This order amends the judgment in this case to comport with the Second Circuit’s 
decisions in H.C. v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., 71 F.4th 120 (2d Cir. 2023).  See ECF No. 52. 
           On April 7, 2022 I issued an opinion and order granting summary judgment to 
Plaintiff for $134,312.90 in attorneys’ fees and costs in this action consistent with the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1415G)(3)(B)-(C).  See ECF No. 
46.  The Clerk entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff on April 28, 2022.  See ECF No. 52.  Both 
parties appealed, and on June 21, 2022, the Second Circuit directed both appeals be “remanded 
for further proceedings in the district court” upon a determination of the tandem appeals heard in 
H.C. y. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ. See ECF No. 58.  The Second Circuit issued its decision resolving 
the tandem appeals and remanded this case on June 21, 2023, See £.C., 71 F.4th at 130, 
           H.C. reiterates district court discretion in attorney fee determinations in IDEA 
actions.  The Court affirmed district court decisions across the spectrum of fee-related issues, 
including calculating attorneys’ fee rates, reducing the number of hours billed to the client, 
declining to award pre-judgment interest, and adjusting excessive travel costs. See id. at 125-29. 
The only fee issue discussed by the Court of Appeals of which it forbad was the outright denial

of travel-related fees.  Id. at 129-30. That issue is not implicated in the case before me on 
remand.  | therefore affirm the calculations included the judgment as a reasonable reflection of 
the complexity of this case. 
            I find on remand that the Second Circuit’s decision in H.C. requires the award of 
post-judgment interest in this case.  In the initial judgment, I declined to award post-judgment 
interest because Plaintiffs never explained why they were entitled to it.  See ECF No, 46 at 6. 
Though the plain text of 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a) supports a reading of awarding post-judgment 
interest as discretionary (“filnterest shall be allowed . . .”), the Second Circuit’s decision implies 
that it is statutorily required in all federal civil cases. H.C., 71 F 4th at 129 (“the award of post- 
judgment interest is mandatory on awards in civil cases as of the date judgment is entered”) 
(quoting Tru-Art Sign Co. v. Loc. 127 Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass’n, 852 F.3d 217, 223 (2d 
Cir. 2017)).  Accordingly, the judgment in this case is amended to include an award of post- 
judgment interest calculated at the applicable statutory rate. 
            As the Second Circuit mandate noted, “either party may restore jurisdiction by 
notifying the Clerk of Court by letter than it seeks further appellate review” without new notice 

nor fee payment. ECF No. 58. 
                                 CONCLUSION 
            The Clerk of Court is to reenter the April 28, 2022 judgment in all respects with 

the addition of a post-judgment interest award pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961,  This case is to 

remain closed.

NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF 
EDUCATION, 
                           Defendant. 
      en nn  a      en en nee  en rn             eK 
ALVIN Kk. HELLERSTEIN, U.S.DJ.: 
           Plaintiffs,  a child with a disability and his parent, initiated this action pursuant to 
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) against the New York City Department 
of Education.  Plaintiffs initially filed this suit seeking enforcement of Findings of Fact and 
Decision (FOFD) issued in an administrative proceeding, along with the fees associated with the 
administrative proceeding and instant action.  Defendant has since come into compliance with its 
obligations and Plaintiffs withdrew the claim for enforcement.  Only Plaintiffs’ application for 
$148,996.05 in attorneys’ fees and costs remains.  See Cuddy Decl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 38-6. 
Defendant does not dispute that Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees under 20 
U.S.C. §1415(4)(3)(B)G), but argues that the award Plaintiffs seek is excessive and not 
“reasonable.”  For the reasons stated on the record and set forth below, Plaintiffs’ application for 
attorneys’ fees is granted, with modifications. 
                                DISCUSSION 
            IDEA was intended to ensure that all children, regardless of intelligence or ability, 
receive an adequate education “that emphasizes special education and related services designed 
to meet their unique needs.”  20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A); see Schaffer v.  Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 51 
(2005); ALR. ex rel. RV. v. N.Y. City Dep't of Educ., 407 F.3d 65, 72 (2d Cir.2005). All are equal 

before the law.  IDEA applies to the schooling of every child with a disability, and every such 
child is assured a free appropriate public education (FAPE) through an Individual Education Plan 
(IEP),  Schaffer, 546 U.S. at 53.  To ensure all disabled children receive an appropriate 
education, IDEA requires states to offer “an array of procedural safeguards,” including the filing 
of a due process complaint and hearing before an impartial adjudicator.  Polera v. Bd. of Educ. of 
Newburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 482 (2d Cir, 2002). 
           Congress has left it to aggrieved parties and their lawyers to vindicate these rights. 
They are important rights and necessitate an award of fees where parents prevail.  In evaluating 
the reasonableness of the fee, the court, among all other factors, should be sensitive to an 
adequate incentivization of counsel to take these cases.  See Kassim v. City of Schenectady, 415 
F.3d 246, 252 (2d Cir.2005); Milwe v. Cavuoto, 653 F.2d 80, 84 (2d Cir.1981) (The award of 
counsel fees is not intended to punish the defendant in any way. Rather it is to permit and 
encourage plaintiffs to enforce their civil rights. To declare those rights while simultaneously 
denying the award of fees would seriously undermine the declared congressional policy.”) 
(citations omitted),  There are not many lawyers who take IDEA cases, perhaps because the fee 
structure has been so tight. See, e.g, ALD. v. New York Dep’t of Educ,, 2021 WL 3030053 
(S.D.N.Y, July 16, 2021); H.C, v. New York City Dep't of Educ., 2021 WL 2471195, at *4 
(S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2021),  With these factors as a frame of reference, I evaluate Plaintiff's 
application. 
            A.  Hourly Rates 
            To calculate a “presumptively reasonable fee,” a district court first determines the 
appropriate billable hours expended and sets a “reasonable hourly rate.” Lilly v. City of New 
York, 934 F.3d 222, 230 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood 
Ass'n vy. Cnty. of Albany & Albany Cnty. Bd. of Elections, 522 F.3d 182, 190 (2d Cir, 2008). 
Determining whether a plaintiff's requested rates are reasonable requires “a case-specific inquiry 
into the prevailing market rates for counsel of similar experience and skill to the fee applicant’s 
counsel.” Farbotko v. Clinton Cnty., 433 F.3d 204, 209 (2d Cir. 2005).  In doing so, courts may 
not make reference solely to rates awarded in prior cases, and must consider whether prior rates 

still reflect the applicable prevailing rate,  Jd; AR. ex rel. RV. v.     City Dep't of Educ. , 407 
F.3d 65, 82 (2d Cir.2005). 
           In Arbor Hill, the Second Circuit clarified how district courts should calculate 
reasonable fee awards, 522 F.3d at 190. There, the Court explained that “[t]he reasonable hourly 
rate is the rate a paying client would be willing to pay.  In determining what rate a paying client 
would be willing to pay, the district court should consider, among others, the Johnson factors; it 
should also bear in mind that a reasonable, paying client wishes to spend the minimum necessary 
to litigate the case effectively.”  Id.  The Johnson factors, from Johnson v. Georgia Highway 
Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974) are the following: 
            (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) 
           the level of skill required to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion 
            of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the attorney's 
            customary hourly rate; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) the time 
            limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved in 
            the case and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the 
            attorneys; (10) the “undesirability” of the case; (11) the nature and length of the 
            professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. 
Courts need not make specific findings as to each factor, provided each is considered when 
determining the ultimate fee award. See E.F. ex rel. NLR. v. N.Y.C, Dep't of Educ., 2014 WL 
1092847, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 17, 2014) (citing Lochren v. Cnty. of Suffolk, 344 F. App'’x 706, 
709 (2d Cir.2009)). 
            Having considered all the Johnson factors, as well as the need to adequately 
incentivize attorneys to represent clients in JDEA fee-shifting cases, I find that the Cuddy Law 
Firm’s rates are reasonable.  Among other factors, the administrative hearing was heavily 
contested and required the skill of an experienced IDEA litigator to prevail, as there were 
multiple days of hearings and five hearings on the merits.  Additionally, the fee was entirely 
contingent, Plaintiff was awarded nearly all the relief sought in the administrative proceeding, 
and the attorneys of the Cuddy Law Firm have years of experience in IDEA litigation.  There is 
also a need to alleviate the view that such cases are “undesirable,” and appropriately incentivize 
attorneys to represent disabled student who could otherwise not afford to litigate meritorious 

cases themselves.  See Kassim, 415 F.3d at 252; Milwe, 653 F.2d at 84.  The rates, although 
higher than other district courts have allowed, are in my judgment reasonable, and much below 
commercial rates charged by experienced attorneys with expertise in their areas of litigation.  | 
also cannot say that there has been an overuse of personnel or an across-the-board failure to 
delegate to lower-billing personnel.  I thus find that Plaintiffs’ counsel are entitled to the 
following rates: $550/hr. for Andrew Cuddy and Jason Sterne, $450/hr. for Kevin Mendillo, 
$425/hr. for Justin Coretti, $400/hr. for Benjamin Kopp, $375/hr. for Erin Murray, and $225/hr, 
for all paralegals. 
           B.  Hours Billed 
           To calculate the reasonable hours expended, courts look to “contemporaneously 
created time records” and exclude “hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise 
unnecessary.”  Kirsch v. Fleet Street, Ltd., 148 F.3d 149, 173 (2d Cir. 1998).  In doing so, “a 
district court may exercise its discretion and use a percentage deduction as a practical means of 
trimming fat from a fee application.”  A4.D. v, New York City Dep't of Educ., 2018 WL 4386086, 
at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2018) (quoting McDonald ex rel. Prendergast v. Pension Plan of the 
NYSA-ILA Pension Tr, Fund, 450 F.3d 91, 96 (2d Cir. 2006)). 
            On balance, the hours Plaintiff's counsel expended in preparing for the 
administrative proceeding and federal proceeding were reasonable,  Defendant argues Plaintiff's 
counsel spent an unreasonable amount of time preparing for various aspects of the administrative 
and federal proceedings.  For instance, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’37 hours to prepare a 
hearing request was unreasonable.  However, doing so required reviewing three years of 
educational records, in addition to drafting the text of the request itself.  That amount of time 
appears reasonable in light of the billing records Plaintiff provides.  Likewise, Defendant argues 
that 24 hours to prepare for the first administrative hearing, which lasted 2.5 hours, was 
unreasonable, and similarly argues that 20 hours to prepare for the second hearing was 
unreasonable.  While the preparation time for the first hearing appears slightly higher than in 
other similar cases, see C.B. v. New York City. Dep't of Educ., 2019 WL 3162177, at *27 
(S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2019), the second hearing lasted longer than 8 hours and was spread over 4 

days.  A ratio of 20 preparation hours to 8 hours of hearing time is well within a reasonable 
range.  See, e.g, id; R.G. v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 2019 WL 4735050, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 
2019).  Asa  final note, much of Plaintiff's billing appears attributable to delays Defendant 
caused, 
           I thus decline to reduce the number of hours for while Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ 
fees, with one exception.  Justin Coretti billed 39.2 hours in travel at $212.50/hr., which amounts 
to half his normal rate, for a total of $8,330.  As stated on the record at oral argument on April 6, 
2022, that amount of travel time is unwarranted because a reasonable client would hire an 
attorney with a much shorter commute.  See H.C., 2021 WL 2471195, at *11.  Accordingly, 
Corretti’s $8,330 billed for travel time is reduced by approximately 70%, to a total of $2,500.  In 
all, Plaintiffs are entitled to $92,157.50 for fees in the administrative action and $41,180 for fees 
in the federal action. 
            C.  Costs & Interest 
            Plaintiff's costs for travel and printing will be reduced.  Defendant argues 
Plaintiff’s expenses for costs of the administrative and federal litigation should be reduced or 
eliminated entirely.  Specifically, Defendant contends that “expenses totaling $3,927.52, 
including fax costs ($332), lodging ($876.13), meals ($235.48), mileage ($1,140.18), parking 
($162.50), postage ($17.82), copying ($636.50 billed at 0.50 per page), toll ($47.63), 
transportation ($77.28), and a filing fee ($402)” should be reduced.  Def. Br, at 21.  Defendant 
also argues Plaintiff is not entitled to an award of interest. 
            The rate for printing will be reduced to $0.10 per page and the costs for faxing 
will be eliminated.  In this district, “$0.10 per page continues to be entirely reasonable 
compensation for printing costs.”  R.G. v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 2019 WL 473 5050, at *6 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2019) (citing Febus v. Guardian First Funding Grp., LLC, 870 F. Supp. 2d 
337, 341 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)).  Plaintiff is entitled to only $127.30 for printing expenses.  The costs 
for faxing are not reasonable.  See id. 
            Plaintiffs’ requested reimbursement for lodging, meals, and transportation should 
also be reduced.  With respect to lodging, courts in this district routinely decline to award 

lodging expenses to the Cuddy firm because a reasonable client would hire attorneys who did not 
have to commute the distances that were traveled.  See H.C., 2021 WL 2471195, at *11 (citing 
C.D., 2018 WL 3769972, at *13); R.G., 2019 WL 4735050, at *6.  The same is true for meals, 
which were not necessary to the legal representation and “would not have been billed by local 
counsel.”  R.G., 2019 WL 47350, at *6.  Similarly, the travel expenses CLF incurred, in the form 
of mileage, tolls, and parking, were largely unnecessary.  A 70% reduction of the requested 
amount is reasonable.  7d; H.C., 2021 WL 2471195, at *11; M.H., 2021 WL 4804031, at *28. 
Applying that reduction, Plaintiffs will be awarded $342.05 for mileage, $48.76 for parking, 
$14.29 for tolls, and $23.18 for transportation for a total of $428.28 as allowable, reimbursable 
expenses. 
           In all, Plaintiff will be awarded $127.30 for printing costs, $428.28 for travel 
costs, $17.82 for postage, and $402 for a federal filing fee, for a total of $975.40 in reimbursable 
expenses.  Plaintiffs have not explained why they are entitled to either pre- or post-judgment 
interest, and I decline to award any interest. 
                                CONCLUSION 
            Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment awarding fees is granted as modified. 
In all, Plaintiffs are awarded $92,157.50 for fees in the administrative matter, $41,180.00 for fees 
in the federal action, and $975.40 in reimbursable expenses, for a total of $134,312.90,  The 
parties shall settle an order implementing this decision by April 27, 2022.  The Clerk shall 
terminate ECF No. 14.
