              ORDER ON DEFENDANTS’ MOTION                               
           TO DISMISS SURVIVING CLAIMS AS MOOT                          
   The remaining Defendants—Jeanne M. Lambrew, Commissioner of the Maine 
Department of Health and Human Services (“Department”), and Dr. Puthiery Va, 
Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“Maine CDC”)—
move to dismiss the outstanding claims against them as moot (ECF No. 188).  The 
motion is premised on the removal of COVID-19 from the list of diseases against 
which  workers  in  designated  healthcare  facilities  (“DHCFs”)  in  Maine  must  be 
immunized under the DHCF worker immunization rule: 10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264.  The 
Plaintiffs,  several  former  healthcare  employees  who  were  subject  to  the 
immunization rule, filed a response (ECF No. 195) that opposes the Defendants’ 
motion and requests permission to amend their Amended Complaint (ECF No. 152) 
“to address any pleading concerns.”  ECF No. 195 at 5.  For the reasons that follow, I 
grant the Defendants’ motion and deny the Plaintiffs’ request.            
                      I.  BACKGROUND                                    
   The procedural history of this case is complex, and includes three appeals to 
the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and two petitions for writ of 

certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.1  The background and essential facts 
are set out in my prior decision, Lowe v. Mills, No. 1:21-cv-00242-JDL, 2022 WL 
3542187, at *2-5 (D. Me. Aug. 18, 2022), and I do not repeat them here.   
A.   Remaining Defendants and Surviving Claims                            
   In the wake of the First Circuit’s decision (ECF No. 163) on the Plaintiffs’ 
appeal from my Order (ECF No. 156)  granting the original Defendants’ prior Motions 

to Dismiss (ECF Nos. 107, 108, 109), the only surviving claims against the remaining 
Defendants, Commissioner Lambrew and Dr. Va, are the Plaintiffs’ constitutional 
claims alleging violations of the First Amendment’s guarantee of the free exercise of 
religion and the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee (the “surviving 
claims”).  The Plaintiffs’ other claims against Commissioner Lambrew and Dr. Va—
alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Supremacy Clause 
of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2; and 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985

(West 2024)—have been dismissed, as have all of the claims against Governor Mills 
and the private healthcare provider Defendants.2                          
B.   Facts Underlying Defendants’ Latest Motion to Dismiss                

   The following facts, drawn from the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss as well as 
the attached affidavit of Deputy Director of the Maine CDC Nancy Beardsley (ECF 
No. 188-1) and Maine CDC data on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths from 
January 2022 through August 2023 (ECF Nos. 188-2,188-3), are largely uncontested 
by the Plaintiffs in their response to the pending motion.  See Gonzalez v. United 
States, 284 F.3d 281, 288 (1st Cir. 2002) (acknowledging that courts may consider 

materials outside the pleadings on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion).               
   On  May  11,  2023,  the  federal  COVID-19  public  health emergency  ended. 
Maine’s  state-level  COVID-19  health  emergency,  which  when  declared  was 
designated to be coterminous with the federal public health emergency, ended that 
same day.  Neither event came as a surprise; in late January 2023, the Biden 
Administration announced that it would end the federal public health emergency on 
May 11, 2023.  That announcement, by implication, forecast an imminent, definitive 

end to the parallel health emergency in Maine declared under state law.   



2  As a consequence of the earlier proceedings, all claims against Governor Mills as well as the private 
healthcare providers who had been named as Defendants in this action—MaineHealth; Genesis 
Healthcare of Maine, LLC; Genesis Healthcare, LLC; Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center; 
and MaineGeneral Health—have been dismissed.  Lowe, 2022 WL 3542187.  Final judgment as to 
those claims has been entered against the private healthcare provider Defendants (ECF Nos. 207, 
208).  Dr. Puthiery Va became the Director of the Maine CDC on August 28, 2023, and replaced former 
Acting Director of the Maine CDC, Nancy Beardsley, as a party to this action on September 20, 2023 
(ECF No. 189).                                                            
   In the months leading up to May 11, 2023, the Department began planning for 
the end of the twin health emergencies, which included “identifying program[s] and 
services that would be ending or transitioning back to pre-COVID standards.”  ECF 

No. 188-1 at 3, ¶ 8.  On June 5, 2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(“CMS”),  a  federal  agency  within  the  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services,  withdrew  its  COVID-19  vaccination  requirement  (the  “CMS  rule”)  for 
healthcare workers employed by many of the same facilities affected by the COVID-19 
vaccination requirement in the Department’s DHCF worker immunization rule.  See 
Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Policy and Regulatory Changes to the Omnibus 

COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination Requirements, 88 Fed. Reg. 36485 (June 5, 
2023) (codified at 42 C.F.R. pts. 416, 418, 441, 460, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 491, and 
494).  The CMS rule change became effective on August 4, 2023.  Id.       
   In late May and early June 2023, after the federal and state COVID-19 health 
emergency declarations had formally terminated, the Department and Maine CDC 
reviewed  then-current  risks  of  COVID-19  in  healthcare  settings  for  the  stated 
purpose of ensuring that the State’s rules and policies were consistent with the latest 

available science and research.  That exercise included reviewing the evidentiary 
basis for the COVID‑19 vaccination requirement in the DHCF worker immunization 
rule.3  The review revealed declining hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 in 
Maine  since  January  2022  as  well  as  increasing  rates  of  vaccination  against 


3  Although the Plaintiffs imply that they are skeptical that this review ever occurred, see ECF No. 
195 at 5 (asserting that the Defendants “purportedly” reviewed the relevant science and research), 
they do not directly contest this fact or offer evidence to substantiate their skepticism. 
COVID-19 in Maine over the same period.  The review also showed other changed 
circumstances: Omicron variants of COVID-19 that were more contagious but less 
virulent than their precursors were predominant, and new treatments like Paxlovid 

and Lagevrio had become widely available.  Based on these trends and changed 
circumstances,  the  Department  concluded  that  requiring  DHCF  workers  to  be 
immunized against COVID-19 was no longer necessary to protect individual patients, 
individual workers, and Maine’s healthcare infrastructure.  On July 11, 2023, the 
Department announced its plan to remove COVID-19 from the list of diseases against 
which  DHCF  workers  must  be  immunized.    In  the  same  announcement,  the 

Department stated it would not enforce the then-existing COVID-19 vaccination 
requirement during the pendency of the rulemaking process to repeal it.   
   On August 31, 2023, the Department formally amended the DHCF worker  
immunization rule to remove COVID-19 and the attendant vaccination requirement; 
the amendment became effective on September 5, 2023.  See 10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264, 
§ 2, amended by order 2023-149 (effective Sept. 5, 2023).  Three days later, the 
Defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the surviving claims had become moot.  

                       II.  DISCUSSION                                  
A.   Threshold Question: What is the Scope of the Plaintiffs’ Claims?     
   In the Amended Complaint, the Plaintiffs challenge what they characterize as 
the  “COVID-19  Vaccine  Mandate,”  ECF  No.  152  at  2,  ¶ 1,  which  they  refer  to 
alternatively as both the “Governor’s COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate,” see, e.g., ECF No. 
152 at 12, ¶ 31, and the “Governor’s mandate,” see, e.g., ECF No. 152 at 2, ¶ 1.  The 
Plaintiffs’ various characterizations of the mandate do not make clear whether they 
challenge the constitutionality of (1) the pre-repeal regulation that listed COVID-19 
among  the  diseases  against  which  DHCF  workers  must  be  immunized  without 

religious  exemptions,  10-144  C.M.R.  ch.  264,  § 2,  amended  by  emergency  order 
2021-166 (effective Aug. 12, 2021); (2) the authorizing statute whose exemptions are 
expressly incorporated into that regulation, 22 M.R.S.A. § 802 (West 2024); or (3) 
some combination of the two.4  For the following reasons, I conclude that the Plaintiffs 
mount an as-applied challenge to the tandem operation of the pre-repeal regulation 
and statute, but no more.                                                 

   First, the specific document that the Plaintiffs identify as the mandate they 
challenge compels that conclusion.  Both the Original Complaint (ECF No. 1) and the 
Amended  Complaint  incorporate  as  Exhibit  A  “a  true  and  correct  copy  of  the 
Governor’s  COVID-19  Vaccine  Mandate”  in  the  form  of  an  August  12,  2021, 
announcement available on the website of the Office of Governor (ECF No. 1-1).  ECF 
Nos. 1 at 15, ¶ 41; 152 at 12, ¶ 31.  The “mandate” provided, in pertinent part: 
   The Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and         
   Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC), utilizing their 
   authority under existing law to require certain vaccinations of people 
   who work in health care settings, issued an emergency rule that will 
   require health care workers to be fully vaccinated [against COVID-19] 
   by October 1, 2021.                                                  

4  The Amended Complaint states expressly that the Plaintiffs are mounting both facial and 
as-applied challenges to the mandate under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, see ECF No. 
152 at 30-32, ¶¶ 114-126, and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, see ECF No. 152 
at 34-36, ¶¶ 142-155.  Those labels, however, are “not what matters”—whether a constitutional claim 
is facial depends on whether the “plaintiffs’ claim and the relief that would follow . . . reach beyond the 
particular circumstances of these plaintiffs.”  Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 194 (2010). 
ECF No. 1-1 at 1.  The mandate’s express reference to an “emergency rule” announced 
on August 12, 2021, firmly supports concluding that the DHCF worker immunization 
rule is the primary focus of the Plaintiffs’ claims.  See 10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264, § 2, 

amended by emergency order 2021-166 (effective Aug. 12, 2021) (adding COVID-19 
to the diseases against which “all employees” of “Designated Healthcare Facilit[ies]” 
must be immunized).5                                                      
   The language that the Plaintiffs use in the Amended Complaint to describe the 
challenged “mandate” and the broader context established by the accompanying 
allegations  further  support  this  conclusion.    The  “COVID-19  Vaccine”  qualifier 

plainly narrows the Plaintiffs’ claims as challenging the vaccination requirement for 
one of the diseases listed in the version of the regulation in effect after August 12, 
2021, or, at most, the statutory exemptions as applied by enforcing that subsection of 
the rule.6  The “Governor” qualifier similarly limits the Plaintiffs’ constitutional 
challenges: promulgating the regulation is within the Governor’s executive power, as 
exercised by the Department pursuant to 22 M.R.S.A. § 42 (West 2024), whereas 
enacting the statutory exemptions that the regulation incorporates—a legislative 

function—is not.  See Baxter v. Waterville Sewerage Dist., 146 Me. 211, 215, 79 A.2d 

5  Lending credence to this conclusion, the “mandate” cribs from the DHCF worker immunization 
rule’s definition of “Designated Healthcare Facility” to identify the persons to whom the then-newly 
announced COVID-19 vaccination requirement applied.  Compare ECF No. 1-1 at 1 (applying the rule 
to “any individual employed by a hospital, multi-level health care facility, home health agency, nursing 
facility, residential care facility, and intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual 
disabilities that is licensed by the State of Maine”) with 10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264, § 1(D), amended by 
order 2021-068 (effective Apr. 14, 2021) (defining a DHCF as “licensed nursing facility, residential care 
facility, Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID), multi-level 
healthcare facility, hospital, or home health agency subject to licensure by the State of Maine”). 
6  Section 802 does not mention COVID-19 or enumerate the diseases against which immunization is 
required.  See generally 22 M.R.S.A. § 802.                               
585,  588  (1951)  (defining  the  scope  of  legislative  power  under  the  Maine 
Constitution); cf. Me. Const. art. III (distribution of powers); Doane v. Dep’t of Health 
& Hum. Servs., 2021 ME 28, ¶ 17, 250 A.3d 1101 (“[T]he separation of powers clause 

of  the  Maine  Constitution . . . precludes  a  statutory  delegation  to  a 
regulator . . . [that] amounts to a surrender of legislative authority to the executive 
branch.”); Stucki v. Plavin, 291 A.2d 508, 510 (Me. 1972) (“[N]o legislative body may 
delegate legislative powers to administrative officers . . . .”).  Because the Governor 
enforces the statutory exemptions through the regulation, the Amended Complaint, 
read in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, plausibly alleges an as-applied 

challenge  to  the  tandem  operation  of  the  regulation  and  the  statute.    See 
Ocasio-Hernández  v.  Fortuño-Burset,  640  F.3d  1,  7  (1st  Cir.  2011)  (stating  the 
standard of review applicable to determine whether plaintiff states a claim for which 
relief can be granted).  By the same token, however, the Amended Complaint does 
not plausibly bring a standalone, as-applied challenge to the statute because its 
exemptions only take effect in this context when the regulation is enforced. 
   Nor  does  the  Amended  Complaint  bring  facial  challenges  to  either  the 

regulation or the statute.  To facially challenge the DHCF worker immunization rule 
and the statute whose exemptions the rule expressly incorporates, the Plaintiffs must 
allege facts to support a claim that the regulation and statute are unconstitutional in 
every instance—i.e., whenever vaccination requirements for any and all diseases 
listed in the regulation may be enforced.  See United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 
745 (1987) (“A facial challenge to a legislative Act is, of course, the most difficult 
challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of 
circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”); see also Facial Challenge, 
Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (“A claim that a statute is unconstitutional on 

its face — that is, that it always operates unconstitutionally.”).  The version of the 
DHCF  worker  immunization  rule in  effect  immediately before  the  August  2021 
emergency order adding COVID-19 included six diseases.  10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264, 
§ 2(A)(1)-(6), amended by order 2021-068 (effective Apr. 14, 2021).7  The Amended 
Complaint  does  not  allege  any  facts  supporting  a  claim  that  enforcing  vaccine 
requirements  for  each  of  those  diseases  without  religious  exemptions  fails  to 

accommodate the Plaintiffs’ sincerely-held religious beliefs.             
   Instead,  the  Plaintiffs’  challenge  has  been  and  remains  focused  on  the 
now-repealed COVID-19 vaccination requirement in 10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264, § 2, 
amended by emergency order 2021-166 (effective Aug. 12, 2021).  The Plaintiffs allege 
injuries arising from their religious objection to receiving the COVID-19 vaccines that 
were available when they filed the Amended Complaint, which, they assert, were 
“derived from, produced or manufactured by, tested on, developed with, or otherwise 

connected to aborted fetal cell lines.”  ECF No. 152 at 16, ¶ 50; see also ECF No. 152 
at 15-18, ¶¶ 48, 51, 54-56, 58-59 (describing basis of Plaintiffs’ religious objections to 
the  COVID-19  vaccines  manufactured  by  Johnson  &  Johnson,  Moderna,  and 
Pfizer/BioNTech).    Indeed,  the  Plaintiffs  currently  contend  that  “the  COVID-19 


7  The current version of the DHCF worker immunization rule maintains vaccination requirements 
for those same six diseases.  10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264, § 2(A)(1)-(6), amended by order 2023-149 (effective 
Sept. 5, 2023).                                                           
vaccination requirement was what crystalized [sic] their injury under the statute.”  
ECF No. 210 at 10:17-19.  The Amended Complaint similarly asserts: “The Governor’s 
COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, targets Plaintiffs’ sincerely 

held religious beliefs by prohibiting Plaintiffs from seeking and receiving exemption 
and accommodation for their sincerely held religious beliefs against the COVID-19 
vaccine.”  ECF No. 152 at 30, ¶ 114 (emphasis added); accord ECF No. 152 at 28, 
¶¶ 102-104 (alleging irreparable injuries that the Plaintiffs have suffered “[a]s a 
result of the Governor’s COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate” (emphasis added)); see also ECF 
No. 152 at 31, ¶ 120 (“The Governor’s COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as 

applied,  creates  a  system  of  individualized  exemptions  for  preferred  exemption 
requests while discriminating against requests for exemption and accommodation 
based on sincerely held religious beliefs.” (emphasis added)).            
   The  Amended  Complaint  does  not  contain  allegations  that  support  a 
reasonable inference that all of the vaccines for all of the diseases listed in the version 
of  the  DHCF  worker  immunization  rule  that  included  COVID-19  have  some 
connection to aborted fetal cells.  Thus, as pleaded, the Plaintiffs’ religious objections 

to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine do not apply to the remaining vaccines and the 
circumstances in which the statutory exemptions may apply.  More fundamentally, 
the Plaintiffs do not allege any facts showing that they have standing to mount so 
broad a challenge.  In sum, the Amended Complaint alleges an as-applied challenge 
to the tandem operation of the regulation and section 802, but does not contain 
allegations supporting a facial challenge to either the rule or the statute.   
   Finally, the Plaintiffs have not shown cause for granting their request to 
amend the Amended Complaint “to address any pleading concerns.”  ECF No. 195 at 
5.  Though courts “freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires,” Fed. R. Civ. 

P. 15(a)(2), justice does not require permitting the Plaintiffs to further amend the 
Amended Complaint to drastically broaden the scope of their claims to challenge all 
possible applications of the DHCF worker immunization rule and the Department’s 
authorizing statute.  Nor, contrary to the Plaintiffs’ contentions, is leave to amend 
warranted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d).  Under Rule 15(d), courts 
allow parties to amend pleadings to add transactions, occurrences, or events that 

happen after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d).  The 
Plaintiffs filed the Amended Complaint on July 11, 2022.  The challenged statute was 
enacted in 1989, amended to add exemptions to immunization in 2001, and further 
amended to repeal a religious exemption in 2019.  22 M.R.S.A. § 802 (1989), amended 
by P.L. 2001, ch. 185, § 2 (effective Sept. 21, 2001) and P.L. 2019, ch. 154, § 9 (effective 
Sept.  19,  2019).8    Because  the  Plaintiffs  have  not  identified  any  post-filing 
transactions, occurrences, or events that would justify additional amendments, their 

request to amend the Amended Complaint under Rule 15(d) is properly denied. 
B.   Whether the Plaintiffs’ Claims are Moot                              
   The Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss centers on the following question: Did the 
Department’s removal of COVID-19 from the DHCF worker immunization rule moot 


8  The Maine Legislature has also amended section 802 to revise provisions within the statute 
unrelated  to  exemptions;  those  amendments  occurred  before  the  Plaintiffs  filed  the  Amended 
Complaint.                                                                
the Plaintiffs’ claims so that this Court no longer has jurisdiction over this matter?  
Article III, section 2 of the United States Constitution confines the jurisdiction of 
federal courts “to those claims that involve actual ‘cases’ or ‘controversies.’”  Redfern 

v. Napolitano, 727 F.3d 77, 83 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1).  
It follows that “federal courts ‘lack constitutional authority to decide moot questions.’”  
Id. (quoting Barr v. Galvin, 626 F.3d 99, 104 (1st Cir. 2010)).  “When a case is moot—
that is, when the issues presented are no longer live or when the parties lack a 
[legally] cognizable interest in the outcome—a case or controversy ceases to exist, and 
dismissal of the action is compulsory.”  Id. at 83-84 (quoting Maher v. Hyde, 272 F.3d 

83, 86 (1st Cir. 2001)).  Put differently, “a case is moot when the court cannot give 
any effectual relief to the potentially prevailing party,” Bayley’s Campground, Inc. v. 
Mills, 985 F.3d 153, 157 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting Town of Portsmouth v. Lewis, 813 
F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 2016)), and the action must be dismissed, Harris v. Univ. of 
Massachusetts Lowell, 43 F.4th 187, 192 (1st Cir. 2022).  “Unless an exception to 
[mootness] applies, to do otherwise would be to render an advisory opinion, which 
Article III prohibits.”  Harris, 43 F.4th at 192 (quoting Pietrangelo v. Sununu, 15 

F.4th 103, 105 (1st Cir. 2021)); see also ACLU of Massachusetts v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. 
Bishops, 705 F.3d 44, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2013) (dismissal required where “events have 
transpired  to  render  a  court  opinion  merely  advisory”  (quoting  Mangual  v. 
Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir. 2003))).                          
   Mootness manifests differently as to claims for declaratory and injunctive 
relief.  “[R]equests for declaratory relief can only survive a mootness challenge where 
‘the facts alleged . . . show that there is a substantial controversy . . . of sufficient 
immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.’”  Harris, 
43 F.4th at 192 (quoting ACLU of Massachusetts, 705 F.3d at 54) (emphasis in 

original).  Claims for injunctive relief are moot when the “challenged [rule] no longer 
adversely affect[s] any plaintiff’s primary conduct.”  Id.  (alterations and quotation 
marks omitted).9                                                          
   The “proper vehicle” for challenging a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction on the 
basis of mootness is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).  Valentin v. Hosp. Bella 
Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 362-63 (1st Cir. 2001).  Where a motion to dismiss for lack of 

jurisdiction is premised on mootness, the “key question ‘is whether the relief sought 
would, if granted, make a difference to the legal interests of the parties (as distinct 
from their psyches, which might remain deeply engaged with the merits of the 
litigation).’”  Boston Bit Labs, Inc. v. Baker, 11 F.4th 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting Air 
Line Pilots Ass’n, Int’l v. UAL Corp., 897 F.2d 1394, 1396 (7th Cir. 1990)).  “The ‘heavy’ 
burden of showing mootness is on the party raising the issue.”  Id. (quoting Connectu 
LLC v. Zuckerberg, 522 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2008)).                      

   As  a  direct  consequence  of  the  Department  removing  the  COVID-19 
vaccination requirement from the DHCF worker immunization rule, which operated 
in tandem with section 802’s exemptions to immunization, this Court cannot provide 


9  Although “a claim for damages will keep a case from becoming moot where equitable relief no longer 
forms the basis of a live controversy,” Thomas R.W. v. Massachusetts Dep’t of Educ., 130 F.3d 477, 480 
(1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 3-11, at 84 (2d ed. 1988)), 
all of the Plaintiffs’ claims for damages against the remaining Defendants have been previously 
dismissed.  See Lowe, 2022 WL 3542187, at *6.                             
any relief to the Plaintiffs that would redress injuries that arise from an actual case 
or  controversy.    To  the  extent  the  Plaintiffs  seek  injunctive  relief,  they  have 
effectively received it through the repeal of the COVID-19 vaccination requirement.  

Cf. Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Healey, 28 F.4th 383, 393 (2d Cir. 2022) (holding that a court 
“cannot enjoin what no longer exists”).  Relatedly, the Plaintiffs’ earlier refusal to 
comply  with  the  since-repealed  COVID-19  vaccination  requirement  does  not 
presently create a barrier to their employment at DHCFs operating in Maine.  The 
Plaintiffs’ former employers who might be enjoined to reinstate the Plaintiffs have 
previously been dismissed as parties to this dispute, see supra note 2, which also 

places the requested injunctive relief beyond the Court’s authority.  Finally, declaring 
the  repealed  requirement  unconstitutional  or  unlawful  at  this  juncture  would 
constitute an unnecessary advisory opinion that would not redress injuries resulting 
from an actual case or controversy.  See, e.g., Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 18 (1998) 
(observing that federal courts “are not in the business of pronouncing that past 
actions which have no demonstrable continuing effect were right or wrong”).   
   In short, the Plaintiffs’ surviving claims are moot, and I therefore consider 

whether any exception to the mootness doctrine applies.                   
C.   Whether an Exception to the Mootness Doctrine Applies                
   Two  recognized  exceptions  to  mootness  are  relevant  here:  the  “voluntary 
cessation” exception and the “capable of repetition yet evading review” exception.  
   1.  Voluntary Cessation Exception                                    
   Government action that “withdraws or modifies a COVID restriction in the 
course of litigation . . . does not necessarily moot the case . . . where [plaintiffs] ‘remain 

under a constant threat’ that government officials will use their power to reinstate 
the challenged restrictions.”  Tandon v. Newsom, 593 U.S. 61, 63 (2021) (quoting 
Roman Cath. Diocese v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 20 (2020)).  Animated by such threats, 
the voluntary cessation exception exists “to stop a scheming defendant from trying to 
‘immunize itself from suit indefinitely’ by unilaterally changing ‘its behavior long 
enough to secure a dismissal’ and then backsliding when the judge is out of the 

picture—‘repeating this cycle until it achieves all its unlawful ends.’”  Boston Bit 
Labs, 11 F.4th at 10 (twice quoting Lewis, 813 F.3d at 59 (alteration omitted), then 
quoting Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013) (alterations omitted)).  The 
exception “‘can apply when a defendant voluntarily ceases the challenged practice in 
order to moot the plaintiff’s case and there exists a reasonable expectation that the 
challenged conduct will be repeated’ after the suit’s ‘dismissal.’”  Id. at 9 (quoting 
Lewis, 813 F.3d at 59) (alteration omitted).  By contrast, the exception “‘does not 

apply’ if the change in conduct is ‘unrelated to the litigation.’”  Id. at 10 (quoting 
Lewis, 813 F.3d at 59).  The party claiming mootness has the burden to show that the 
voluntary cessation exception does not apply.  Id.                        
   The  Defendants  contend  that  the  Department  repealed  the  COVID-19 
vaccination  requirement  “based  on  changed  circumstances  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic, not on this litigation.”  ECF No. 188 at 12.  As evidence of this fact, the 
Defendants cite declining hospitalizations and death rates over the period between 
January  2022  and  August  2023,10  rising  COVID-19  vaccination  rates,  the 
predominance of less virulent variants of the original virus, the availability of new 

treatments, and increased population immunity from vaccination and prior infection.   
   In response, the Plaintiffs strive to cast the repeal decision as a bad-faith 
litigation tactic.  Their reframing of the repeal decision rests on the close temporal 
proximity between the First Circuit’s opinion in Lowe v. Mills, 68 F.4th 706 (1st Cir. 
2023), aff’g in part and rev’g in part 2022 WL 3542187 (D. Me. Aug. 18, 2022), entered 
on May 25, 2023, and the launch of the Defendants’ review of the science underlying 

the COVID-19 vaccination rule in late May/early June 2023.  The Plaintiffs contend 
that  the  review  being  launched  on  the  heels  of  the  First  Circuit’s  decision  is 
circumstantial evidence of a spurious scheme by the Defendants to rid themselves of 
a case they thought they had won, but that was revived on appeal.11       

10  At oral argument on the pending motions (ECF No. 210), the Plaintiffs contended that the 
Defendants’  proffered  statistics  (ECF  Nos.  188-1,  188-2,  188-3)  show  increasing  rates  of 
COVID-19-related hospitalizations and death rates between July and August 2023 when rulemaking 
to repeal the COVID-19 vaccination requirement occurred.  The Plaintiffs are correct: the average 
number of daily hospitalizations attributable to COVID-19 increased from 31 to 44 between July and 
August 2023, and the number of deaths per month attributable to COVID-19 rose from three to eight 
during  the  same  period.  Those  short-term  upticks  notwithstanding,  the  Defendants’  proffered 
statistics, viewed in their entirety, show broader, unambiguous trends of consistently declining rates 
of COVID‑19-related hospitalizations and deaths between January 2022 and August 2023, which the 
Plaintiffs’ selective statistical subset does not refute.                 
11  The Plaintiffs argue:                                               
        State Defendants explicitly admit that it was not until “around the end of May 
   2023 and the beginning of June 2023,” that they purportedly “reviewed the available 
   science and research on the then current risks of COVID-19 in healthcare settings.”  
   (MTD 5.)  And, on July 11, 2023, “the Department announced that it was proposing to 
   end the requirement that DHCFs require their employees to be vaccinated against 
   COVID-19.”  (Id. at 7.)  This timing is unequivocally relevant to the determination of 
   whether State Defendants’ contentions of mootness have any merit.  One need not 
   ponder too long to see the importance of this admission.  The First Circuit released its 
   decision on Plaintiffs’ appeal of the dismissal of their Complaint on May 25, 2023, see 
   The meaning that the Plaintiffs attribute to the sequence of key events ignores 
the undisputed fact that the Defendants’ reassessment of the need for the vaccination 
requirement followed shortly after the federal and state COVID-19 public health 

emergencies ended on May 11, 2023.   The Plaintiffs also overlook the fact that the 
reassessment coincided with the June 5, 2023, announcement of the withdrawal of 
the CMS rule.  The Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the Defendants engaged in a bad faith 
litigation  tactic,  while  not  accounting  for  obviously  relevant  Federal  and  State 
governmental  actions,  is  based  on  a  substantially  incomplete  and,  therefore, 
misleading  narrative  of  the  relevant  events.    Further,  the  Plaintiffs  have  not 

supported their position with declarations under oath or exhibits, nor have they 
requested permission to perform discovery on the issue.                   
   Accordingly, the Plaintiffs do not credibly dispute the fact that the review that 
led the Department to reconsider the continued need for the COVID-19 vaccination 
requirement for DHCF workers was prompted by the termination of the federal and 
Maine COVID-19 public health emergency declarations on May 11, 2023.  It is 


   Lowe v. Mills, 68 F.4th 706 (1st Cir. 2023), and held that Plaintiffs had stated a claim 
   upon which relief can be granted and that “it is plausible, in the absence of any factual 
   development, that the Mandate” violates the Free Exercise Clause.  Id. at 714. 
        Thus, precisely “around the end of May 2023” (MTD 5) when the First Circuit 
   held that Plaintiffs were entitled to probe their First and Fourteenth Amendment 
   claims in discovery, State Defendants had a sudden revelation that they should 
   reconsider the evidence concerning the Vaccine Mandate.  That timing is critical here.  
   After Plaintiffs fought for two years to have their day in Court, and despite State 
   Defendants admitting that they were aware of changed circumstances concerning the 
   risk of COVID-19 beginning “in January 2022” (MTD 6 (emphasis added)), State 
   Defendants did nothing to alter the challenged Vaccine Mandate until the eve of 
   discovery commencing in this Court.  That is a litigation tactic, not a genuine change 
   of heart, and it precludes a finding of mootness.                    
ECF No. 195 at 5-6.                                                       
self-evident that responsible public officials who are charged with protecting public 
health would reevaluate Maine’s vaccination policies in response to the simultaneous 
termination of federal and state public health emergency declarations.  It is also 

beyond  serious  dispute  that  the  events  leading  up  to  the  Department’s 
reconsideration of the need for the COVID-19 vaccine requirement were outside the 
Defendants’ control.  Moreover, the Plaintiffs have not challenged the scientific basis 
for the Department’s conclusion in July 2023 that requiring DHCF workers to be 
immunized against COVID-19 was no longer necessary to help protect individual 
patients, individual workers, and Maine’s healthcare infrastructure.  The Defendants 

have met their burden of demonstrating that the Department initiated its review and 
ultimately decided to repeal the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for substantial 
reasons unrelated to this litigation, and not out of bad faith.  The voluntary cessation 
exception to mootness does not apply.                                     
   2.  Exception for Conduct Capable of Repetition but Evading Review   
   The Plaintiffs fare no better with the other relevant exception to mootness, 
which relates to conduct capable of repetition but evading judicial review.  This 

exception “‘applies only in exceptional situations’ where . . . ‘(1) the challenged action 
is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration, and 
(2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject 
to the same action again.’”  Spencer, 523 U.S. at 17 (first quoting City of Los Angeles 
v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983), then quoting Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 
472,  481  (1990)  (alterations  omitted)).    In  contrast  to  the  voluntary  cessation 
exception, the Plaintiffs have the burden to show that both prongs in this conjunctive 
test are satisfied.  ACLU of Massachusetts, 705 F.3d at 57.               
   On this record, the Plaintiffs have not met their burden as to the second prong 

because they fail to present any positive, non-speculative evidence to support a 
reasonable  expectation  that  they  will  be  subject  to  the  challenged  COVID-19 
vaccination requirement—or one substantially similar to it—again.  Ne. Fla. Chapter 
of Associated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 662 & n.3 (1993).  
Nor  do  the  Plaintiffs  demonstrate  a  “probability”  of  the  same.    ACLU  of 
Massachusetts, 705 F.3d at 57 (quotation marks omitted)).  Instead, Plaintiffs pin 

their reasonable expectation argument on the Defendants’ (1) retained authority to 
amend  the  DHCF  worker  immunization  rule  in  the  future,  leaving  open  the 
possibility that the Defendants could return COVID-19 to the rule’s list of required 
vaccinations; and (2) refusal “to concede any unlawful conduct” in this litigation.  ECF 
No. 195 at 17 (quoting ECF No. 188 at 14 n.5).  Under similar circumstances, 
however, the First Circuit has squarely rejected the same argument.       
   In Boston Bit Labs, the First Circuit reiterated that the “sheer ‘power to 

reinstitute a challenged law is not a sufficient basis on which a court can conclude 
that a challenge remains live.’”  11 F.4th at 11 (alteration omitted) (quoting Am. 
Bankers Assoc. v. Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 934 F.3d 649, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2019)).  
That the Boston Bit Labs Court weighed the risk of recurrence in light of a governor’s 
power to issue executive orders, 11 F.4th at 10, is a distinction without a difference.  
Here, the Plaintiffs’ alleged expectation of recurrence derives from the Department’s 
power to promulgate rules under 22 M.R.S.A. § 802.  Rules adopted under section 802 
are routine technical rules, as defined in 5 M.R.S.A. § 8071(2)(A) (West 2024), 22 
M.R.S.A. § 802(3), that are subject to rulemaking procedures under 5 M.R.S.A. § 8052 

(West 2024), 5 M.R.S.A. § 8071(3).  The rulemaking procedures under section 8052 
include an opportunity for the public to provide comments to raise their concerns and 
an accompanying requirement that the promulgating agency specifically address the 
comments and provide a rationale for incorporating or dismissing them.  5 M.R.S.A. 
§ 8052(1), (5).  These procedures function as a check on executive agencies’ authority 
to adopt rules that is not present when Maine’s Governor issues executive orders 

during  emergencies,  like  the  COVID-19  state  health  emergency.    See  37-B 
M.R.S.A. § 741(3)(A) (West 2024).  Even the more relaxed emergency rulemaking 
procedures that agencies follow when “necessary to avoid an immediate threat to 
public health, safety or general welfare,” 5 M.R.S.A. § 8054(1) (West 2024)—and that 
the  Department  presumably  followed  when  promulgating  the  now-repealed 
COVID-19 vaccination requirement for DHCF workers, see 10-144 C.M.R. ch. 264 
(2023) (characterizing the August 12, 2021, rule change adding COVID-19 to section 

2 as “EMERGENCY ROUTINE TECHNICAL”)—include the possibility of public     
checks that do not apply when Maine’s Governor issues emergency orders.   
   As a fallback, the Plaintiffs argue that the “Defendants have failed to make it 
absolutely clear that such deliberate conduct is unlikely to recur again.”  ECF No. 
195 at 18.  This argument, however, conflates the Defendants’ burden as to the second 
prong of the voluntary cessation exception, see Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw 
Env’t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (articulating the “absolutely clear” 
requirement),  with  the  Plaintiffs’  burden  to  show  that  the        
conduct-capable-of-repetition exception to mootness applies.              

   The Plaintiffs have not presented any affirmative support to substantiate that 
their expectation that the challenged conduct will recur is reasonable.  Accordingly, 
the conduct-capable-of-repetition exception to mootness does not apply.   
                      III.  CONCLUSION                                  
   Because the Plaintiffs’ surviving claims are moot following the repeal of the 
COVID-19 vaccination requirement from the DHCF worker immunization rule and 

no exception to mootness applies, it is ORDERED that the Defendants’ Motion to 
Dismiss (ECF No. 188) is GRANTED; the Plaintiffs’ request to amend the First 
Amended  Complaint  (ECF  No.  195  at  5)  is  DENIED;  and  the  First  Amended 
Complaint (ECF No. 152) is DISMISSED.                                     
   SO ORDERED.

On July 28, 2023, Defendants MaineHealth, Genesis Healthcare of Maine, 
LLC, Genesis Healthcare LLC, MaineGeneral Health, and Northern Light Eastern 
Maine Medical Center (together, the “Provider Defendants”) moved for entry of final 
judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (ECF No. 
172).  The Provider Defendants filed their motion after the United States Court of 
Appeals for the First Circuit issued a mandate (ECF No. 165) affirming this Court’s 
dismissal  of  the  Plaintiffs’  claims  against  them  (ECF  No.  156)  and  before  the 
Plaintiffs petitioned for writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court to 
review the First Circuit’s decision.  Lowe v. Mills, 68 F.4th 706 (1st Cir. May 25, 
2023), petition for cert. filed No. 23-152 (U.S. Aug. 15, 2023).          
The Provider Defendants aver that only the Supreme Court can revive the 
otherwise  finally  adjudicated  claims  against  them.    See  ECF  No.  172  at  3 
(acknowledging that the “only potential avenue for further review” of the claims 
against them runs through the Supreme Court).  The Plaintiffs agree.  See ECF No. 
180 at 2 (“The claims against Provider Defendants will rise or fall on the Supreme 
Court’s decision, whether on certiorari or on the ultimate merits.”).  The Supreme 

Court denied the Plaintiffs’ petition for writ of certiorari on October 30, 2023.  Lowe 
v. Mills, No. 23-152, 2023 WL 7117039 (U.S. Oct. 30, 2023).               
Accordingly, I take no action on the Provider Defendants’ Motion for Entry of 
Final Judgment at this time.  It is ORDERED that the Provider Defendants shall 
submit, within fourteen days of the issuance of this Order, a supplemental filing that 
explains why their Motion for Entry of Final Judgment (ECF No. 172) is not mooted 

by the Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari, absent which the motion will be denied 
as moot.                                                                  

SO ORDERED.                                                          
Dated this 7th day of November, 2023.

       ORDER ON STATE DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY                        
   The  State  Defendants—Janet  T.  Mills,  Governor  of  Maine,  Jeanne  M. 
Lambrew, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, 
and Nancy Beardsley, Acting Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention—have moved to stay this proceeding (ECF No. 173).  Their motion seeks 
“to stay this matter as to Plaintiffs’ remaining claims against State Defendants 
during the pending rulemaking on amendments proposed to the healthcare worker 
vaccination rule at issue in this case, Immunization Requirements for Healthcare 
Workers, 10-144 Me. Code R. ch. 264 (“Rule”), and an anticipated motion to dismiss.”  
ECF No. 173 at 1.  The State Defendants represent that the COVID-19 healthcare 
worker vaccination rule—which is the subject of Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint and 
constitutional  challenges  (ECF  No.  152)—will  be  repealed  effective  on  or  about 
September 21, 2023.1  ECF No. 181 at 3-4.  They also represent that the Department 

1  The State Defendants initially asserted that the rule change repealing the healthcare worker 
vaccination rule would be “finalized . . . on or about October 17, 2023.”  ECF No. 173 at 2.  After the 
public-comment period on the rule change closed on August 17, 2023, they revised their timetable for 
has not enforced the vaccination requirement against designated health care facilities 
since July 11, 2023, and will continue to suspend enforcement.  Thus, the State 
Defendants contend that designated health care facilities “can permit employees who 

are not vaccinated against COVID-19 (and not medically exempt) to attend work in 
those facilities.”  ECF No. 173 at 3; accord ECF No. 181 at 5.  And once the rule 
change is finalized, the State Defendants intend to “move to dismiss this matter on 
mootness grounds.”  ECF No. 173 at 3.                                     
   The Plaintiffs oppose the requested stay, citing this case’s protracted history, 
which has included multiple appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit 

and the Supreme Court.  ECF No. 179 at 1, 5.  They fear that a stay, if granted, will 
last for an extended, indeterminate period because they intend to contest the State 
Defendants’ promised motion to dismiss.  Id. at 3-6.  The Plaintiffs buttress this 
argument by emphasizing that their First Amendment challenge is “to the overall 
scheme  in  Maine  that  prohibits  religious  accommodations,  as  opposed  to  an 
individual agency rule.”  Id. at 7.  Thus, the Plaintiffs argue, “the speculative repeal 
of the Rule would still not moot Plaintiffs’ challenge under various exceptions to 

mootness,  including  the  doctrines  of  sham  repeals  to  manipulate  the  Court’s 
jurisdiction, and the ‘capable of repetition yet evading review’ exception to mootness.”  
Id. at 8.                                                                 
   A court’s authority to stay a proceeding is “incidental to the power inherent in 
every court to control the disposition of the causes [sic] on its docket with economy of 
time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.”  Landis v. North American 

Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936).  “Of course, stays cannot be cavalierly dispensed: there 
must be good cause for their issuance; they must be reasonable in duration; and the 
court must ensure that competing equities are weighed and balanced.”  Marquis v. 
FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1155 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Pan Am Sys., Inc. v. Hardenbergh, 

2012 WL 4855205, *1 (D. Me. Oct. 12, 2012).  Those equities include (1) potential 
prejudice to the non-moving party, (2) hardship to the movant absent a stay, and (3) 
judicial economy.  Good v. Altria Grp., Inc., 624 F. Supp. 2d 132, 134 (D. Me. 2009).
   Whether the instant case should be stayed turns largely on the likelihood of 
whether  the  repeal  of  the  healthcare  worker  vaccination  rule  will  render  the 
Plaintiffs’ constitutional challenges moot.  “The doctrine of mootness enforces the 

mandate that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of the review, not 
merely at the time the complaint is filed.  The burden of establishing mootness rests 
with the party invoking the doctrine[.]”  Am. Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts 
v. U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, 705 F.3d 44, 52 (1st Cir. 2013) (internal 
quotations and citations omitted).  Even if moot under this standard, an action is not 
subject to dismissal where the voluntary cessation exception to the mootness doctrine 
applies.  See id. at 43-44.  That exception rests on the principle “‘that a party should 

not be able to evade judicial review, or to defeat a judgment, by temporarily altering 
questionable behavior.’”  Id. at 54 (quoting City News & Novelty, Inc. v. City of 
Waukesha, 531 U.S. 278, 284 n.1 (2001)).  “However, even in circumstances where the 
voluntary cessation exception applies, a case may still be found moot if the defendant 
meets ‘the formidable burden of showing that it is absolutely clear the allegedly 
wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.’”  Id. at 55  (quoting 
Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 190 
(2000)).                                                                  
   The State Defendants’ motion does not offer a developed argument, supported 

by  case  authority,  demonstrating  the  merit  of  their  mootness  argument.  As  a 
consequence, the Plaintiffs did not present a fully developed argument in response.  I 
am, therefore, not in a position to decide whether the expected final revocation of the 
COVID-19 healthcare worker vaccination rule will render all of the claims in the 
Amended Complaint moot and, if so, whether the voluntary cessation exception or 
some other exception to the mootness doctrine applies.  The present possibility that I 

may, in the future, determine that the Amended Complaint is both moot and not 
subject to any exception to the mootness doctrine does not demonstrate the good cause 
required to stay this long-standing action.                               
   My conclusion that the requested stay is not, at this juncture, supported by 
good cause does not mean that the State Defendants have no remedy for the harm 
they claim they may suffer in connection with the expense and demands of discovery.  
The Court has discretion to organize and time the discovery and pretrial process to 

account for the State Defendants’ expected Motion to Dismiss.  Either party may 
move to amend the Scheduling Order entered on July 12, 2023 (ECF No. 171), 
including, but not limited to, that order’s deadline to disclose experts required by Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(A) and related deadlines leading up to the filing of dispositive 
motions.                                                                  
   It is accordingly ORDERED that the State Defendants’ Motion to Stay (ECF 

No. 173) is DENIED.                                                       
SO ORDERED.                                                          
Dated:  August 25, 2023

               ORDER ON MOTIONS TO DISMISS                              

   The  Plaintiffs  are  seven  Maine  healthcare  workers  who  challenge  the 
lawfulness of the Maine administrative rule that requires employees of designated 
Maine healthcare facilities to be vaccinated against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—
the cause of COVID-19 infections.  See Immunization Requirements for Healthcare 
Workers, 10-144-264 Me. Code R. §§ 1-7 (amended Nov. 10, 2021) (LexisNexis 2022) 
(the “Rule”).1  The Plaintiffs contend that the Rule’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate 
violates their First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion and other federal 
constitutional and statutory rights because it does not exempt individuals whose 
sincerely held religious beliefs cause them to object to being vaccinated against 
COVID-19.    The  Plaintiffs  also  contend  that  their  employers  violated  federal 
employment law by refusing to grant them a religious exemption from the vaccination 
requirement.                                                              
   The Plaintiffs’ amended complaint (ECF No. 152) names as defendants, in 
their official capacities, Governor Janet T. Mills; Dr. Nirav D. Shah, the Director of 
Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention (“Maine CDC”); and Jeanne M. 

Lambrew,  the  Commissioner  of  the  Maine  Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services (“DHHS”) (collectively, the “State Defendants”).  The amended complaint 
also names as defendants five incorporated entities that operate healthcare facilities 
in Maine: Genesis Healthcare of Maine, LLC; Genesis Healthcare, LLC; Northern 
Light  Eastern  Maine  Medical  Center;2  MaineHealth;  and  MaineGeneral  Health 
(collectively, the “Hospital Defendants”).  The Plaintiffs’ amended complaint presents 

five claims arising under: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. 
§§ 2000e to e-17 (West 2022); the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment; the 
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the Supremacy Clause; and 
42 U.S.C.A. § 1985 (West 2022) (Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights).   
   The State and Hospital Defendants move to dismiss (ECF Nos. 107, 108, 109) 
each of the preceding claims for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The State Defendants also move, pursuant to Federal Rule 

of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), to dismiss all claims against Governor Mills for lack of 
jurisdiction, and all monetary damages claims against the State Defendants on the 
basis of sovereign immunity.                                              



2  The complaint originally named Northern Light Health Foundation as a defendant; Northern Light 
Eastern Maine Medical Center was substituted as a party for Northern Light Health Foundation (ECF 
No. 101) on January 20, 2022.                                             
   A hearing on the Motions to Dismiss was held on June 24, 2022.3  After careful 
consideration and for the reasons that follow, I grant the Defendants’ motions. 
                      I.  BACKGROUND                                    

   The factual background is drawn from the Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, 
documents incorporated by reference, and from official public records that are subject 
to judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201, including the Rule challenged 
by the Plaintiffs and the related statute and its legislative history.  See Newton 
Covenant Church v. Great Am. Ins., 956 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir. 2020); Watterson v. Page, 
987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993).  A court has discretion “to[] take judicial notice of the 

legislative history of federal and state law and of municipal ordinances.”  Mitchell v. 
United States, No. 1:15-cr-00040, No. 1:19-cv-00184, 2020 WL 5942316, at *7 (D. Me. 
Oct. 7, 2020) (quoting 1 Jack B. Weinstein, et al., Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 
201.52[3][a] (2d ed. 2020)).  I also take judicial notice of information from the official 
U.S.  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (“CDC”)  and  the  Maine  CDC 
government websites “that is ‘not subject to reasonable dispute.’”  Fortuna v. Town of 
Winslow, No. 1:21-cv-00248, 2022 WL 2117717, at * 3 (D. Me. June 13, 2022) (quoting

   COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness that spreads between people who 
are in close contact with one another, through respiratory droplets or small particles.  
As of mid-August 2022, there have been 201,840 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 


3 On October 13, 2021, I denied the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  Does 1-6 v. Mills,

disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml (last visited August 18, 2022).  In 2021, 

COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in the state.  Maine CDC, et al. (July

   Effective  August  12,  2021,  DHHS  and  the  Maine  CDC  adopted  on  an 
emergency basis the requirement that all employees of designated Maine healthcare 

facilities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  See 10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 5(A)(7) 
(amended Aug. 12, 2021).  On November 10, 2021, the Rule was amended on a non-
emergency basis to permanently adopt the COVID-19 vaccination requirement.4  See 
10-144-264 Me. Code R. §§ 1(F)(7), (2)(A)(7) (amended Nov. 10, 2021).  Under the 
Rule,  an  employee  may  not  be  permitted  by  an  employer  to  attend  work  at  a 
designated  healthcare  facility  if  he  or  she  does  not  comply  with  the  vaccine 
requirement, unless the employee is exempt in accordance with the requirements of 

22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B) (West 2022), which permits medical, but not religious or 
philosophical, exemptions from required vaccinations.  10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 3.  


4  Under the Rule, “designated healthcare facility” “means a licensed nursing facility, residential care 
facility, Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID), multi-level 
healthcare facility, hospital, or home health agency subject to licensure by the State of Maine, 
Department of Health and Human Services Division of Licensing and Certification.”  10-144-264 Me. 
Code R. § 1(E) (amended Nov. 10, 2021).  Although the emergency rule also applied to dental health 
practices and emergency medical services organizations, 10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 2(B) (amended Aug. 
12, 2021), these practices are not included in the current version of the Rule, 10-144-264 Me. Code R. 
§§ 1(E), 2(A) (amended Nov. 10, 2021).  All references to “designated healthcare facilities” in this Order 
A  designated  healthcare  facility  that  violates  the  Rule  is  subject  to  sanctions, 
including the imposition of fines and license suspension.  10-144-264 Me. Code R. 
§ 7(G) (amended Nov. 10, 2021) (“If a Designated Healthcare Facility fails . . . to 

comply with the requirements of this rule, the Department may take enforcement 
action pursuant to 22 MRS §804 [providing for the imposition of a fine and/or license 
suspension as a sanction for any person who violates a DHHS rule] or as otherwise 
provided by law.”); 22 M.R.S.A. § 804 (West 2022).                        
B.   The Plaintiffs’ Objection to the COVID-19 Vaccines                   
   The  Plaintiffs  are  seven  individuals  who  were  formerly  employed  by  the 
Hospital Defendants.5                                                     

   Plaintiff Alicia Lowe was formerly employed by Defendant MaineHealth at one 
of its healthcare facilities in Maine.  She submitted a written request for a religious 
exemption from the vaccine, which was denied.  Because of her refusal to obtain a 
COVID-19  vaccination,  Lowe  was  terminated  from  her  employment.    She 
subsequently  sought  and  obtained  a  Notice  of  Right  to  Sue  from  the  Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”).                               

   Plaintiffs Debra Chalmers and Garth Berenyi were formerly employed by 
healthcare facilities operated by Defendant Genesis Healthcare in Maine.  Both

v. Mills, No. 1:21-cv-00242, 2021 WL 4005985, at *2-3 (D. Me. Sept. 2, 2021).  Following a Motion to 
Unseal Plaintiffs’ Identities (ECF No. 105) filed by intervening media companies, the Plaintiffs were 
ordered to file an amended complaint identifying themselves by name.  Does 1-6 v. Mills, 1:21-cv-
00242, 2022 WL 1747848, at * 7 (D. Me. May 31, 2022).  The Plaintiffs sought a stay of this order from 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which was denied on July 7, 2022.  Does 1-3 v. Mills, 
No. 22-1435, 2022 WL 2526989, at * 5 (1st Cir. July 7, 2022).  The Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, 
identifying the seven remaining plaintiffs by name, was filed on July 11, 2022.  
submitted written requests for religious exemptions from the vaccine mandate, and 
Genesis Healthcare denied the requests.  Chalmers and Berenyi were terminated 
from their employment following their refusals to obtain COVID-19 vaccinations.  

Both subsequently sought and obtained Notices of Right to Sue from the EEOC.  
   Plaintiffs  Jennifer  Barbalias,  Natalie  Salavarria,  and  Adam  Jones  were 
formerly employed by healthcare facilities operated by Defendant Northern Light 
Eastern  Maine  Medical  Center in  Maine.    Each  submitted  written  requests  for 
religious  exemptions  from  the  vaccine  mandate,  and  each  request  was  denied.  
Barbalias, Salavarria, and Jones were terminated from their employment following 

their refusals to obtain COVID-19 vaccinations.  Each subsequently sought and 
obtained Notices of Right to Sue from the EEOC.                           
   Plaintiff Nicole Giroux was formerly employed by a healthcare facility operated 
by Defendant MaineGeneral Health in Maine.  She submitted a written request for a 
religious exemption from the vaccine mandate, which was denied.  Because of her 
refusal  to  obtain  a  COVID-19  vaccination,  Giroux  was  terminated  from  her 
employment.  She subsequently sought and obtained a Notice of Right to Sue from 

the EEOC.                                                                 
   As more fully explained in their amended complaint, the Plaintiffs object to 
receiving the COVID-19 vaccines based on their religious belief that “life is sacred 
from the moment of conception,” ECF No. 152 at ¶ 46, and their assertion that the 
development of the three COVID-19 vaccines employed or benefitted from the cell 
lines of aborted fetuses.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs object to the Moderna and Pfizer 

vaccines because both are mRNA vaccines, which, the amended complaint claims, 
“have their origins in research on aborted fetal cells lines.”  ECF No. 152 at ¶ 55.  The 
Plaintiffs also object to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, asserting that aborted fetal 
cell lines were used in both its development and production.  The amended complaint 

states that the use of fetal cell lines to develop the vaccines runs counter to the 
Plaintiffs’ sincerely held religious beliefs that cause them to oppose abortion. 
C.   The COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate                                         
   Mandatory vaccination requirements for healthcare workers in Maine were 
established long before the emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019.  Maine has required 
by statute, 22 M.R.S.A. § 802 (1989), that hospitals and other healthcare facilities 
ensure that their employees are vaccinated against certain communicable diseases 

since 1989.  1989 Me. Legis. Serv. 641 (West).  When the governing statute, 22 
M.R.S.A. § 802 (1989), was first enacted, it mandated vaccinations for measles and 
rubella.  Its stated purpose was to report, prevent, and control infectious diseases 
that pose a potential public health threat to the people of Maine.  Id. § 802(1)(D) 
(1989).                                                                   
   The statute was amended in 2001 to grant rulemaking authority to DHHS to 

specify mandatory vaccines for school children as well as for healthcare workers at 
designated healthcare facilities.  See 2001 Me. Legis. Serv. 147 (West).  Accordingly, 
in 2002, DHHS promulgated and first adopted “Immunization Requirements for 
Healthcare Workers,” which is the original version of the Rule at issue here.  10-144-
264  Me.  Code  R.  §§  1-7  (Apr.  16,  2002).    As  then  adopted,  the  Rule  required 
vaccinations for measles, rubella, hepatitis B, mumps, and chickenpox.  Id. § 5(A).   
   From  2001  until  2019,  the  statute  recognized  three  exemptions  from  the 
vaccination  requirements  for  both  healthcare  workers  and  school  children:    A 
“medical  exemption,”  available  for  those  who  provided  “a  physician’s  written 

statement  that  immunization  against  one  or  more  diseases  may  be  medically 
inadvisable”; and both “religious [and] philosophical exemption[s]” for those “who 
state[d] in writing a sincere religious or philosophical belief that is contrary to the 
immunization requirement.”  22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B)(A), (B) (2019).  In 2019, the 
statute  was  revised  to  eliminate  the  exemptions  for  religious  and  philosophical 
beliefs, 2019 Me. Legis. Serv. 386 (West), thus leaving the medical exemption as the 

sole  exemption  permitted  under  law.    In  response  to  this  legislative  change,  a 
statewide veto referendum regarding the new law eliminating the religious and 
philosophical exemptions was held in March 2020 pursuant to the People’s Veto 
provision of the Maine Constitution, Me. Const. art. IV, pt. III, § 17.  The vote resulted 
in the law being upheld, with over 72% of those casting ballots voting in favor of 
retaining the medical exemption as the sole exemption.6  In April 2021, DHHS 
amended the Rule to conform it to the statute by removing the listed exemptions from 

the  Rule  and  having  the  Rule refer  to  the  statute  as governing  the  authorized 
exemption.  See 10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 3 (effective Apr. 14, 2021); 22 M.R.S.A.

§ 802(4-B)(B) (West 2022).7  In August 2021, DHHS again amended the Rule by 
adding the COVID-19 vaccination to the list of required vaccinations.  10-144-264 Me. 
Code  R.  §  1(F)(7)  (amended  Aug.  12,  2021).    The  current  version  of  the  Rule, 

promulgated in November 2021, continues to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for 
healthcare workers.  10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 1(F)(7) (amended Nov. 10, 2021).  The 
Plaintiffs do not challenge the lawfulness of the rulemaking process by which the 
current version of the Rule was adopted.                                  
   The  preceding  history  demonstrates  that  although  the  Plaintiffs’  legal 
challenge is aimed at the August 2021 amendment of the Rule resulting in all 

healthcare workers in Maine being required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 
by October 1, 2021, it was the Legislature’s 2019 revision of the statute, 22 M.R.S.A. 
§ 802(4-B), that eliminated the religious exemption from all mandatory vaccines.  
Thus, DHHS’ removal of the religious and philosophical exemptions in April 2021 
served to conform the Rule to the requirements of the statute.  References in this 
Order to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate refer to both the current version of the Rule 
and the statute, 22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B), which operate in tandem.         

   Having provided the necessary background, I turn to the arguments set out in 
the Defendants’ motions to dismiss.                                       





7  There is an additional exemption provided specifically for the Hepatis B vaccine, as mandated 
under federal law, 22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B)(C) (West 2022), which is unique and not relevant to the 
                       II.  DISCUSSION                                  
A.   Legal Standard                                                       
   “The proper vehicle for challenging a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction is 

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).”  Valentin v. Hosp. Bella Vista, 254 F.3d 358, 
362 (1st Cir. 2001).  The plaintiff carries the burden of demonstrating the existence 
of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1209 (1st Cir. 
1996).  Nonetheless, “[i]n ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(1),  the  district  court must  construe  the 
complaint  liberally,  treating  all  well-pleaded  facts  as  true  and  indulging  all 

reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.”  Id. at 1209-10.        
   In reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 
12(b)(6), a court must “accept as true all well-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint 
and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader’s favor.”  Rodríguez-
Reyes v. Molina-Rodríguez, 711 F.3d 49, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting Santiago v. 
Puerto Rico, 655 F.3d 61, 72 (1st Cir. 2011)).  Additionally, a court may consider 
information “gleaned from documents incorporated by reference into the complaint, 

matters of public record, and facts susceptible to judicial notice.”  Id. at 53 (quoting 
Haley v. City of Boston, 657 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 2011)).  Although conclusory legal 
statements “can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be supported by 
factual allegations.” 8  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  To survive a motion 


8  The first six pages of the amended complaint set forth several legal and policy arguments in support 
of the Plaintiffs’ position that are not in keeping with Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure’s requirement that a pleading seeking relief must contain “a short and plain statement of 
the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”                
to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the complaint “must contain sufficient factual 
matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Rodríguez-Reyes, 711 
F.3d at 53 (quoting Grajales v. P.R. Ports Auth., 682 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2012)).  

   The court is not “required to accept as true allegations that contradict exhibits 
attached to the Complaint or matters properly subject to judicial notice, or allegations 
that  are  merely  conclusory,  unwarranted  deductions  of  fact,  or  unreasonable 
inferences.”  Daniels-Hall v. Nat’l Educ. Ass’n, 629 F.3d 992, 998 (9th Cir. 2010). 
B.   Legal Analysis                                                       
   As noted at the outset, the Plaintiffs’ amended complaint presents five claims 

arising under: Title VII, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e to e-17; the Free Exercise Clause of the 
First Amendment; the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the 
Supremacy Clause; and 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985 (West 2022) (Conspiracy to Interfere with 
Civil Rights).                                                            
   “When faced with motions to dismiss under both 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), a district 
court, absent good reason to do otherwise, should ordinarily decide the 12(b)(1) 
motion first.”  Ne. Erectors Ass’n of BTEA v. Sec’y of Lab., Occupational Safety & 

Health Admin., 62 F.3d 37, 39 (1st Cir. 1995).  Thus, I begin my analysis with a 
discussion  of  the  State  Defendants’  motion,  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil 
Procedure  12(b)(1),  to  dismiss  all  claims  against  Governor  Mills  for  lack  of 
jurisdiction, and all monetary damages claims against the State Defendants on the 
basis of sovereign immunity.                                              
   1.  Claims Against Governor Mills and Damages Claims Against All     
        State Defendants                                                

   The  State  Defendants  move  to  dismiss  all  the  Plaintiffs’  claims  against 
Governor Mills under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-
matter  jurisdiction,  asserting  standing  arguments.    The  State  Defendants  also 
contend that the Eleventh Amendment bars the Plaintiffs from pursuing official-
capacity damages claims against any of the State Defendants.  The Plaintiffs failed 
to oppose the State Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.  “It is settled beyond 
peradventure that issues mentioned in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by 
some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.”  Collins v. Marina-
Martinez, 894 F.2d 474, 481 n.9 (1st Cir. 1990).  See also Putney, Inc. v. Pfizer, Inc., 
No. 07-108-P-H, 2007 WL 3047159, at *8 (D. Me. Oct. 17, 2007) (explaining that, 
because the non-moving party failed to respond to arguments raised in the motion to 

dismiss, “the motion to dismiss may be granted for that reason alone”); see also Doe 
v. Bredesen, 507 F.3d 998, 1007 (6th Cir. 2007) (“The district court correctly noted 
[that the plaintiff] abandoned [multiple] claims by failing to raise them in his brief 
opposing the government’s motion to dismiss the complaint.”).  Because the Plaintiffs 
failed to oppose the Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, I treat the affected claims as 
abandoned.  Thus, the claims against Governor Mills and damages claims against all 
State Defendants are properly dismissed.                                  

   2.  Title VII                                                        
   The Hospital Defendants move to dismiss the Title VII claims asserted against 
them in the amended complaint.  I address their arguments by considering (a) the 
legal  framework  associated  with  those  claims  in  this  case,  and  (b)  the  parties’ 
arguments.                                                                
   a.  Legal Framework                                                  

   Title VII prohibits employers from “discriminat[ing] against[] any individual 
because of his . . . religion.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-2(c)(1) (West 2022).  Discrimination 
is  effectuated  through  an  adverse  employment  action,  which  is  defined  as  “a 
significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, 
reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a 
significant change in benefits.”  Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 761 

(1998).  “The First Circuit applies a two-part framework to religious discrimination 
claims under Title VII.  First, the plaintiff must make her prima facie case that a 
bona fide religious practice conflicts with an employment requirement and was the 
reason for the adverse employment action.”  Cloutier v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 390 
F.3d 126, 133 (1st Cir. 2004).  “In order to establish a prima facie case of religious 
discrimination based on a failure to accommodate, the plaintiff must show that ‘(1) a 
bona fide religious practice conflicts with an employment requirement, (2) he or she 

brought the practice to the [employer’s] attention, and (3) the religious practice was 
the basis for the adverse employment decision.’”  EEOC v. Union Independiente de la 
Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados de P.R., 279 F.3d 49, 55 (1st Cir. 2002) 
(quoting EEOC v. United Parcel Serv., 94 F.3d 314, 317 (7th Cir. 1996)).  
   Second, “if the plaintiff establishes her prima facie case, the burden then shifts 
to the employer to show that it offered a reasonable accommodation or, if it did not 

offer an accommodation, that doing so would have resulted in undue hardship.”  
Cloutier, 390 F.3d at 133.  Title VII establishes that employers must accommodate 
“all aspects of [their employees’] religious observance and practice, as well as belief, 
unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate an 

employee’s or prospective employee’s religious observance or practice without undue 
hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e(j) (West 
2022).  “[A]n employer need not give an employee her preferred accommodation” to 
comply with Title VII.  Oquendo v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 857 Fed App’x 9, 11 (1st 
Cir. Apr. 29, 2021) (unpublished).  Under Title VII, an accommodation is an undue 
hardship “if it would impose more than a de minimis cost on the employer.”  Cloutier, 

390 F.3d at 134.  The undue hardship “calculus applies both to economic costs, such 
as lost business or having to hire additional employees to accommodate a Sabbath 
observer, and to non-economic costs, such as compromising the integrity of a seniority 
system.”  Id.                                                             
   The amended complaint asserts that the Plaintiffs hold sincerely held religious 
beliefs against receiving COVID-19 vaccinations and that the Hospital Defendants 
refused to consider or grant religious accommodations by failing to grant a religious 

exemption  from  the  vaccine  mandate,  in  violation  of  Title  VII.    The  amended 
complaint declares at the outset, in bold letters:  “All Plaintiffs seek in this lawsuit 
is to be able to continue to provide the healthcare they have provided to 
patients for their entire careers, and to do so under the same protective 
measures that have sufficed for them to be considered superheroes for over 
two years.”  ECF No. 152 ¶ 8.  This declaration is in keeping with the various 

allegations in the amended complaint indicating that a religious exemption from the 
vaccine mandate was the exclusive accommodation the seven Plaintiffs sought from 
their respective employers.  Throughout the amended complaint and memoranda of 
law,  the  Plaintiffs  employ  the  terms  “religious  accommodation”  and  “religious 

exemption” interchangeably, but, as I will discuss, although a “religious exemption” 
is a type of “religious accommodation,” it is by no means the only type.  
   The focus of the Hospital Defendants’ motions to dismiss is the undue hardship 
affirmative defense afforded to the Hospital Defendants by Title VII.  The Hospital 
Defendants do not challenge the Plaintiffs’ ability to make out a prima facie claim.  
Specifically, the Hospital Defendants do not challenge the sincerity of the Plaintiffs’ 

asserted religious beliefs or that those beliefs are the reason for the Plaintiffs’ refusal 
to  be  vaccinated.    Nor  do  they  challenge  the  Plaintiffs’  contentions  that  their 
employment was terminated because they refused to receive COVID-19 vaccinations 
in keeping with Plaintiffs’ religious objections to the vaccine.  Thus, for purposes of 
the motions to dismiss, the Plaintiffs have set forth a prima facie case of religious 
discrimination in violation of Title VII, and the motions turn on the undue hardship 
affirmative defense.                                                      

   b.  Legal Analysis of the Title VII Claims                           
   The Hospital Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs’ Title VII claim must be 
dismissed because, based on the allegations of the amended complaint, the sole 
accommodation sought by the Plaintiffs—a religious exemption from the vaccine 
requirement—would necessarily, as a matter of law, impose an undue hardship on 
them as employers and therefore the accommodation is not required by Title VII.  

Undue hardship is an affirmative defense for purposes of Title VII that must be pled 
and proven by the employer.  See Adeyeye v. Heartland Sweeteners, LLC, 721 F.3d 
444, 448 (7th Cir. 2013) (“The statutory definition of “religion” in Title VII . . . 
[includes] an explicit affirmative defense for failure-to-accommodate claims if the 

accommodation  would  impose  an  undue  hardship  on  the  employer.”);  Union 
Independiente de la Autoridad de Acueductos y Alcantarillados de P.R., 279 F.3d at 
55 (explaining that the employer bears the burden to show that any accommodation 
would result in undue hardship).                                          
   In  its  decision  affirming  my  order  denying  the  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  a 
Preliminary Injunction, the First Circuit determined that the “hospitals need not 

provide the exemption the appellants request because doing so would cause them to 
suffer undue hardship.”  Does 1-6 v. Mills, 16 F.4th at 36.  Although informative, this 
determination is not conclusive at this stage because it was preliminary, having been 
voiced in connection with appellate review of the denial of the Plaintiffs’ motion for a 
preliminary injunction.                                                   
   The Hospital Defendants contend that the amended complaint, which asserts 
that “the Governor has threatened to revoke the licenses of all health care employers 

who fail to mandate that all employees receive the COVID-19 vaccine,” ECF No. 152 
¶ 34, demonstrates on its face that the threat of sanctions for violating the mandate 
is real and is more than a de minimis hardship for purposes of Title VII.  In addition, 
the Hospital Defendants note that the Plaintiffs do not allege that they sought or are 
entitled to any other reasonable accommodation.                           
   “Affirmative defenses may be raised in a motion to dismiss, provided that the 

facts establishing the defense [are] clear ‘on the face of the plaintiff’s pleadings.’”  
Zenon v. Guzman, 924 F.3d 611, 616 (1st Cir. 2019) (alterations omitted) (quoting 
Santana-Castro v. Toledo-Davila, 579 F.3d 109, 113-14 (1st Cir. 2009)).  “[W]hen the 
facts establishing the defense appear within the four corners of the complaint, and 

upon review there is ‘no doubt’ that the plaintiff’s claim is barred by the raised 
defense, dismissal is appropriate.”  Id. at 616.  Thus, my analysis must address 
whether the facts establishing the affirmative defense are clear on the face of the 
pleadings, and then whether there is any room to doubt that the Plaintiffs’ action is 
barred by the affirmative defense of undue hardship as asserted by the Hospital 
Defendants.                                                               

   As a threshold matter, and before addressing the Plaintiffs’ arguments in 
response to the motion, the record reflects that there is no dispute between the parties 
as to what Maine’s vaccine mandate requires of designated healthcare facilities and 
the consequences for such employers, including the Hospital Defendants, if they were 
to choose to violate it.  The Rule provides:  “If a Designated Healthcare Facility fails 
.  .  .  to  comply  with  the  requirements  of  this  rule,  the  Department  may  take 
enforcement action pursuant to 22 MRS §804 or as otherwise provided by law.”  10-

144-264 Me. Code R. § 7(G) (amended Nov. 10, 2021).  The statute, 22 M.R.S.A. § 804, 
provides:                                                                 
   Any person who neglects, violates or refuses to obey the rules . . . may 
   be ordered by the department, in writing, to cease and desist. . . .  In 
   the case of any person who refuses to obey a cease and desist order . . .  
   the department may impose a fine, which may not be less than $250 or 
   greater than $1,000 for each violation. Each day that the violation  
   remains uncorrected may be counted as a separate offense. . . .      

   A licensing agency under the department may immediately suspend a    
   license pursuant . . . for a violation under this section.           
   Further, the amended complaint itself acknowledges in paragraphs 33 and 34 
that the vaccine mandate required the Hospital Defendants not to employ healthcare 
workers who were unvaccinated against COVID-19 as of October 1, 2021:     
   The  Governor’s  COVID-19  Vaccine  Mandate  also  says  that  “[t]he 
   organizations to which this requirement applies must ensure that each 
   employee  is  vaccinated,  with  this  requirement  being  enforced  as  a 
   condition of the facilities’ licensure.”                             

   Thus, the Governor has threatened to revoke the licenses of all      
   health care employers who fail to mandate that all employees         
   receive the COVID-19 vaccine.                                        

ECF No. 152 ¶¶ 33-34 (emphasis in original).  Thus, among other penalties, the 
Hospital  Defendants  would  risk  the  immediate  suspension  of  their  state-issued 
licenses if they were to violate the vaccine mandate.                     
   The Plaintiffs make several arguments in response to the Hospital Defendants’ 
position that it is clear from the face of the amended complaint that the Plaintiffs’ 
Title VII claims are barred by the undue hardship defense.                
   First, the Plaintiffs contend in a conclusory fashion that “[c]ompliance with 
Title VII is not and cannot be an undue hardship.”  ECF No. 117 at 25.  They offer no 
support, however, for the proposition underlying this argument—that employers’ 
Title VII obligations excuse them from having to comply with a state statute and rule 
which mandate various vaccinations for healthcare workers—other than to argue 
that  under  the  Supremacy  Clause  of  the  Constitution,  “the  federal  law  takes 
precedence and the state law is preempted,” ECF No. 117 at 26 (emphasis omitted) 
(quoting Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1480 (2018)).                   
   Preemption occurs when “Congress enacts a law that imposes restrictions or 
confers rights on private actors [and] a state law confers rights or imposes restrictions 
that conflict with the federal law.”  Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1480.  Title VII’s provisions 

do not authorize or permit employers, however, to exempt their employees from 
federal  and  state  laws  with  impunity.    The  statute  expressly  provides  that  its 
provisions should not be construed “to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, 
duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law of any State or 
political subdivision of a State, other than any such law which purports to require or 
permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice” under 

Title VII.  42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-7 (West 2022).  “[A]n employer is not liable under Title 
VII when accommodating an employee’s religious beliefs would require the employer 
to violate federal or state law.”  Sutton v. Providence St. Joseph Med. Ctr., 192 F.3d 
826, 830 (9th Cir. 1999) (affirming dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint because the 
requested accommodation would require the employer to violate federal law, which 
was an undue hardship as a matter of law).  Similarly, “[e]very circuit to consider the 
issue has . . . h[e]ld that Title VII does not require an employer to reasonably 

accommodate an employee’s religious beliefs if such accommodation would violate a 
federal statute.”  Yeager v. FirstEnergy Generation Corp., 777 F.3d 362, 363 (6th Cir. 
2015); see also Seaworth v. Pearson, 203 F.3d 1056, 1057 (8th Cir. 2000) (“Requiring 
defendants to violate the Internal Revenue Code and subject themselves to potential 
penalties by not providing Seaworth's SSN on information returns results in undue 
hardship.”).  Thus, the Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the Hospital Defendants’ obligation 

to comply with Title VII necessarily excuses them from having to comply with the 
vaccine  mandate  is  unavailing  because  the  consequences  that  the  Hospital 
Defendants would face for their noncompliance are more than de minimis.  See 
Ansonia  Bd.  of  Educ.  v.  Philbrook, 479  U.S.  60,  67  (1986) (noting  that  an 

accommodation causes an undue hardship whenever it results in a more-than-de 
minimis cost to the employer).                                            
   Second,  the  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  question  of  whether  the  Hospital 
Defendants’ refusal to accommodate the Plaintiffs’ religious objections constitutes an 
undue hardship is a question of fact that cannot properly be decided on a motion to 
dismiss.    The  Plaintiffs  cite  to  numerous  decisions  indicating  that  whether  an 

otherwise reasonable accommodation sought by an employee would present an undue 
hardship for the employer is generally a question of fact and not for decision at the 
motion-to-dismiss stage.  See, e.g., McWright v. Alexander, 982 F.2d 222, 227 (7th Cir. 
1992) (“As for the balance between ‘reasonable accommodation’ and ‘undue hardship,’ 
these matters are questions of fact and thus generally inappropriate for resolution on 
the pleadings.”); Kimbro v. Atl. Richfield Co., 889 F.2d 869, 877 (9th Cir. 1989) (“[W]e 
note  that  whether  a  particular  accommodation  would  have  imposed  an  undue 

hardship  on  the  employer  is  a  question  of  fact.”);  Doe  1  v.  NorthShore  Univ. 
HealthSystem, No. 21-cv-05683, 2021 WL 5578790, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 30, 2021) 
(“Assessing the undue-hardship question on the merits typically requires factual 
development, because whether an employer can ‘reasonably accommodate a person’s 
religious beliefs without undue hardship “is basically a question of fact.”’” (quoting 
Minkus v. Metro. Sanitary Dist. of Greater Chi., 600 F.2d 80, 81 (7th Cir. 1979))).  

Here, however, and as explained previously, the facts establishing the requirements 
of the vaccine mandate and the consequences for employers who fail to abide by it are 
not in dispute.  The Plaintiffs have not pointed to any disputed fact in relation to the 
requirements of the vaccine mandate that requires further development beyond the 

motion to dismiss stage.                                                  
   Finally, the Plaintiffs contend that the State Defendants and the Hospital 
Defendants  have  adopted  inconsistent  positions  on  whether  any  religious 
accommodation is available under the vaccine mandate.  The Plaintiffs argue that 
the “Defendants cannot have their cake and eat it too, relying on the Vaccine Mandate 
to say it would be an undue hardship to violate state law while at the same time 

espousing that the Vaccine Mandate does not prohibit employers from providing an 
accommodation under Title VII.”  ECF No. 117 at 28.  The Plaintiffs then assert that 
“[i]f State Defendants do not prohibit such an accommodation under Title VII, then 
[Hospital] Defendants cannot claim an undue hardship for violating a state law that 
does not prohibit providing Plaintiffs with accommodations.”  ECF No. 117 at 29.9   
   The stated positions of the State and Hospital Defendants are not, however, 
inconsistent.  The amended complaint does not allege that any of the Defendants have 

asserted that all religious accommodations, apart from the exemption the Plaintiffs 
desire, are unavailable.  As the Plaintiffs acknowledge in paragraph 90 of their 
amended  complaint,  when  MaineHealth  denied  Plaintiff  Lowe’s  request  for  a 
religious exemption, it also informed her:  “If you seek an accommodation other than 

9  The Plaintiffs quote from written DHHS guidance that explains that, although the Rule does not 
prohibit  employers  from  providing  reasonable  accommodations  under  Title  VII,  “if  such 
accommodations are provided by a [designated healthcare facility, those accommodations] must 
comply with the [R]ule.”  ECF No. 117 at 28 (quoting State of Me., Health Care Workers Vaccination 
FAQs,  (Nov.  10,  2021),  https://www.maine.gov/covid19/vaccines/public-faq/health-care-worker-
a religious exemption from the state mandated vaccine, please let us know.”  ECF No. 
152 ¶ 90.  Contrary to the Plaintiffs’ argument, the State and Hospital Defendants’ 
positions–that a religious exemption from the vaccine mandate is not available but 

that other religious accommodations consistent with both Title VII and Maine’s 
COVID-19 vaccine mandate may be available–are consistent.                 
   c.  Conclusion                                                       
   To reprise, the facts establishing the affirmative defense of undue hardship are 
clear  from  the  face  of  the  Plaintiffs’  pleadings,  and  there  is  no  doubt  that  the 
affirmative defense bars the Plaintiffs’ Title VII claim.  The Plaintiffs sought one 

specific religious accommodation to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate—an exemption—
that, if granted, would place the Hospital Defendants in violation of state law.  Title 
VII does not mandate that employers provide the specific accommodation requested 
by an employee, nor does it require employers to provide accommodations that would 
require the employer to violate state law.  Accepting the properly pled facts set forth 
in the amended complaint as true, if the Hospital Defendants had granted the sole 
accommodation sought by the Plaintiffs, it would result in an undue hardship by 

subjecting the Hospital Defendants to the imposition of a fine and the “immediat[e] 
suspension of a license.”  22 M.R.S.A. § 804(2), (3).                     
   The amended complaint and the other information that may be considered 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) leaves no doubt that the Plaintiffs’ Title VII claims are 
barred by the affirmative defense of undue hardship.  See Zenon, 924 F.3d at 616.  
Accordingly, the amended complaint fails to state plausible claims for relief under 

Title VII and the claims are properly dismissed.                          
   3.  Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment                      
   The Plaintiffs assert that the appropriate standard of constitutional review for 
their claim under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment is strict scrutiny, 

which, they contend, is a standard that the COVID-19 mandate cannot survive.  The 
State  Defendants  contend  that  the  less-demanding  rational  basis  standard  of 
constitutional review applies, and that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate satisfies this 
standard and thus does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.  The question of which 
standard of constitutional review applies in this case turns on whether the COVID-
19 vaccine mandate is neutral and generally applicable, as explained further below.  

   The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the states through the Fourteenth 
Amendment, provides that “Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise” 
of religion.  U.S. Const. amend. I, see Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303-04 
(1940) (incorporating the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment against the 
states).  The Clause “embraces two concepts[:] freedom to believe and freedom to act.”  
Cantwell, 310 U.S. at 303.  Although the freedom to believe is absolute, the freedom 
to act on one’s religious beliefs “remains subject to regulation for the protection of 

society.”  Id. at 304.                                                    
   The Free Exercise Clause does not prevent states from enacting a “neutral, 
generally  applicable  regulatory  law,”  even  when  that  law  infringes  on  religious 
practices.  See Emp. Div., Dep’t of Hum. Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 879-882 
(1990).  Laws that are deemed both neutral and generally applicable are traditionally 
subject to rational basis review.  Thus, in Smith, the U.S. Supreme Court explained:  

“We have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance 
with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate.  On 
the contrary, the record of more than a century of our free exercise jurisprudence 
contradicts that proposition.”  Id. at 878-79.  Further, “if prohibiting the exercise of 

religion . . . is not the object of the [state action] but merely the incidental effect of a 
generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not 
been offended.”  Id. at 878.                                              
   However,  if  a  law  burdens  a  religious  practice  and  does  not  satisfy  the 
requirements of neutrality and general applicability, the law is invalid under the Free 
Exercise Clause unless it survives strict scrutiny.  Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, 

Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993).  Under this heightened standard of 
review, a law will be deemed invalid under the Free Exercise Clause unless it is 
“justified by a compelling governmental interest and . . . narrowly tailored to advance 
that interest.”  Id. at 531-32.                                           
   To determine whether rational basis or strict scrutiny review applies, I turn to 
consider whether the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is both (1) neutral and (2) generally 
applicable.                                                               

   a.  Neutrality                                                       
   Neutrality examines whether the State’s object, or purpose, was to “infringe 
upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation.”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 
533.  A law is not neutral if its object “is to infringe upon or restrict practices because 
of their religious motivation.”  Id.  The first step in determining the object of a law is 
to  examine  whether  it  is  facially  neutral.  Id.  (“[T]he  minimum  requirement  of 

neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.”).                 
   By this standard, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate challenged here is facially 
neutral.  Neither the statute nor the Rule mention religion, even by implication.  
Operating  in  tandem,  they  require  that  all  healthcare  workers  employed  at 

designated healthcare facilities receive the COVID-19 vaccination.  They do not treat 
the COVID-19 vaccine differently than any other vaccines mandated under Maine 
law.                                                                      
   The vaccine mandate’s facial neutrality is not dispositive, though, because a 
“[g]overnment [also] fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of 
religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature.”  Fulton v. 

City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021).  Thus, even a facially neutral law 
may not be neutral for Free Exercise purposes if its object is to discriminate against 
religious beliefs, practices, or motivations.  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534 (“The Free 
Exercise Clause protects against governmental hostility, which is masked, as well as 
overt.”).  To discern whether the object of a law is discriminatory, courts look to “the 
historical background of the decision under challenge, the specific series of events 
leading  to  the  enactment  or  official  policy  in  question,  and  the  legislative  or 

administrative history, including contemporaneous statements made by members of 
the decision[-]making body.”  Id. at 540.                                 
   The amended complaint asserts that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is not 
neutral  because  the  removal  of  the  religious  exemption  from  the  Rule  in  2021 
“specifically target[ed] Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs for disparate and discriminatory 
treatment.”  ECF No. 152 ¶ 119.  The amended complaint asserts that “[b]y removing 

statutorily  required  religious  accommodations  from  consideration  in  Maine,  the 
Governor has created and singled out for disparate treatment a specific class of 
healthcare employees (i.e., religious objectors to COVID-19 vaccinations) as compared 
to other similarly situated healthcare workers (i.e., those with medical exemption 

requests).”    ECF  No.  152  ¶ 147.    The  Plaintiffs  characterize  this  removal  as  a 
“religious gerrymander.”  ECF No. 152 ¶ 121.                              
   The Plaintiffs’ “religious gerrymander” argument fails to account for the fact 
that it was the Maine Legislature, and not the Governor, that removed religious and 
philosophical exemptions from mandated vaccines, and that the removal occurred 
with the 2019 amendment of the statute, two years prior to the enactment of the Rule 

challenged by Plaintiffs.  Following the unsuccessful People’s Veto held in 2020 that 
challenged the 2019 statutory change, DHHS removed the religious exemption from 
the Rule in April 2021 to conform the Rule to the change.  These revisions pre-dated 
the adoption of the COVID-19 vaccine requirement.                         
   The 2019 revision of 22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B) is therefore distinguishable from 
the history of the revision of the regulation challenged in New Hope Family Services 
v. Poole, 966 F.3d 145 (2d. Cir. 2020), which Plaintiffs heavily rely upon.  In New Hope 

Family Services, a Christian adoption agency brought a Free Exercise challenge 
against  a  facially  neutral  regulation  that  prohibited  adoption  agencies  from 
discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and marital status.  Id. at 148-49.  
The regulation at issue was revised to include this non-discrimination provision in 
2013, and for five years following that change the agency continued its practice of 
referring unmarried or same-sex couples seeking to adopt to other agencies because 

of  the  agency’s  religious  belief  against  recommending  or  placing  children  with 
unmarried or same-sex couples.  Id. at 157-58.  In 2018, though, the state notified the 
agency that it would need to change its policy to comply with the regulation, or it 
would be required to close.  Id. at 158-59.  The district court granted the state’s motion 

to  dismiss  the  agency’s  complaint,  determining  that  the  regulation  was  facially 
neutral and that there was no evidence that the aim of the regulation was to restrict 
or  infringe  upon  religious  practices.    The  Second  Circuit  reversed,  id.  at  160, 
determining that the complaint raised a plausible suspicion of hostility to religious 
beliefs despite the regulation’s facial neutrality for multiple reasons.  Id. at 165-70.  
These included the apparent inconsistencies between the regulation at issue and the 

statute it implemented, the abrupt and unexplained change in the way the Plaintiff’s 
practices  were  treated,  and  public  statements  made  by  agency  personnel  that 
arguably demonstrated hostility to religious beliefs.  Id.                
   Here, unlike in New Hope Family Services, the amended complaint does not 
allege facts that raise a plausible suspicion that hostility to religious beliefs motivated 
Maine’s removal of non-medical exemptions to mandatory vaccinations.  Accepting 
all well-pleaded facts in the amended complaint as true and drawing all reasonable 

inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs, the amended complaint does not allege facts 
suggesting that religious animosity inspired the statutory removal of the religious 
exemption to mandatory vaccinations in 2019 or the corresponding revision made to 
the Rule in April 2021.  Nor does the amended complaint allege any public comments 
or other facts associated with the adoption of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 
August 2021 that would, if proven, establish that the same arose from a hostility to 

religious beliefs.                                                        
   For the foregoing reasons, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is neutral.  
   b.   General Applicability                                           
   General applicability addresses whether the State has selectively “impos[ed] 

burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.”  Lukumi, 508 at 543.  The 
State  Defendants  contend  that  the  COVID-19  vaccine  mandate  is  generally 
applicable  and  does  not  target  religious  beliefs  because  the  distinction  between 
permitted medical exemptions and prohibited non-medical exemptions is based on an 
employee’s medical condition, not the employee’s beliefs.  The Plaintiffs argue that 
“the  Vaccine  Mandate  treats  religious  exemptions  less  favorably  than  some 

nonreligious exemptions.  That is enough to remove the law from [the] neutrality and 
general applicability requirement of the First Amendment.”  ECF No. 117 at 6.   
   The Plaintiffs’ approach to the question of general applicability bypasses a 
necessary analytical step.  Courts must first determine whether the religious and 
secular interests at issue are comparable and then, if they are, examine, whether the 
less  favorable  treatment  of  religious  interests  results  from  a  constitutionally 
impermissible  value  judgment.    As  the  Supreme  Court  recently  explained, 

“government regulations are not neutral and generally applicable, and therefore 
trigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause, whenever they treat any 
comparable  secular activity  more  favorably  than  religious  exercise.”    Tandon  v. 
Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1296 (2021).                                     
   The Plaintiffs contend that the secular activity at issue in this case that is 
comparable to the religious exemption the Plaintiffs seek is the COVID-19 vaccine 

mandate’s medical exemption from all mandatory vaccines.  The Plaintiffs assert that 
because individuals who are medically exempt from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine 
pose the same risk to the larger population as those who would be religiously exempt, 
the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is not generally applicable.                 

   The Supreme Court has explained that “whether two activities are comparable 
for  purposes  of  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  must  be  judged  against  the  asserted 
government  interest  that  justifies  the  regulation.”    Id.    The  COVID-19  vaccine 
mandate’s purpose is threefold:  (1) “to protect the health and lives of Maine people,” 
(2) to “safeguard Maine’s health care capacity,” and (3) to “limit the spread of the 
[COVID-19] virus.”  ECF No. 1-1 at 1 (Press Release from Governor Mills’s office 

announcing  the  Rule).    A  medical  exemption  to  state-mandated  vaccines  is 
fundamentally different and, therefore, not comparable to a religious exemption 
because a medical exemption aligns with the State’s interest in protecting public 
health  and,  more  specifically,  medically  vulnerable  individuals  from  illness  and 
infectious diseases, while non-medical exemptions, including religious exemptions, 
do not.  This fundamental difference was recognized in the First Circuit’s earlier 
decision in this case: “[E]xempting from vaccination only those whose health would 

be endangered by vaccination does not undermine Maine’s asserted interests here: 
(1) ensuring that healthcare workers remain healthy and able to provide the needed 
care to an overburdened healthcare system; (2) protecting the health of the those in 
the state most vulnerable to the virus—including those who are vulnerable to it 
because they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons; and (3) protecting the health 
and safety of all Mainers, patients and healthcare workers alike.”  Does 1-6 v. Mills, 

16 F.4th at 30-31.                                                        
   Thus, exempting healthcare workers whose own health would be endangered 
if  forced  to  receive  a  vaccine  is  in  harmony  with  the  purpose  of  the  vaccine 
requirement itself—to protect public health.  Additionally, the COVID-19 vaccine 

mandate at issue here provides a single objective exemption—a medical exemption—
and as the First Circuit observed, “[n]o case in this circuit and no case of the Supreme 
Court holds that a single objective exemption renders a rule not generally applicable.”  
Does 1-6 v. Mills, 16 F.4th at 30.                                        
   Individualized exemptions may, however, undermine a regulation’s general 
applicability if they display an unconstitutional value judgment that gives preference 

to secular concerns over religious concerns.  In Fulton, the Supreme Court explained 
that “[a] law is not generally applicable if it invites the government to consider the 
particular reasons for a person’s conduct by providing a mechanism for individualized 
exemptions.”  Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1877; see also Cent. Rabbinical Cong. of U.S. & 
Can. v. N.Y.C. Dep’t. of Health & Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 197 (2d Cir. 2014) 
(“A law is . . . not generally applicable if it is substantially underinclusive such that 
it regulates religious conduct while failing to regulate secular conduct that is at least 

as harmful to the legitimate government interests purportedly justifying it.”).  The 
Plaintiffs also contend that the medical exemption at issue here should be treated as 
an individualized exception that is “sufficiently suggestive of discriminatory intent 
so as to trigger heightened scrutiny.”  ECF No. 117 at 11 (quoting and relying on 
Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359, 366 
(3d Cir. 1999)).  In Fraternal Order of Police, the Third Circuit applied strict scrutiny 

to invalidate a regulation that prohibited beards for male police officers that was 
adopted for the stated purpose of promoting uniformity of the officers’ appearance, 
and that granted a medical exemption from the requirement while not exempting 
officers who maintained beards as a matter of religious faith.  170 F.3d at 365-67.   

   In this case, the amended complaint and the properly considered documents, 
information, and facts before me show that the purpose of requiring COVID-19 
vaccinations for healthcare workers is solely to protect public health.  Exempting 
individuals whose health will be threatened if they receive a COVID-19 vaccine is an 
essential, constituent part of a reasoned public health response to the COVID-19 
pandemic.  It does not express or suggest a discriminatory bias against religion.  See 

W.D. v. Rockland County, 521 F. Supp. 3d 358, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (concluding that 
New York’s emergency declaration mandating vaccinations against measles, which 
provided a medical exemption but not a religious exemption, met the requirement of 
general  applicability  by  “encouraging  vaccination  of  all  those  for  whom  it  was 
medically possible, while protecting those who could not be inoculated for medical 
reasons”).  In the context of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, the medical exemption 
is rightly viewed as an essential facet of the vaccine’s core purpose of protecting the 

health of patients and healthcare workers, including those who, for bona fide medical 
reasons, cannot be safely vaccinated.  In addition, the vaccine mandate places an 
equal  burden  on  all  secular  beliefs  unrelated  to  protecting  public  health—for 
example, philosophical or politically-based objections to state-mandated vaccination 
requirements—to the same extent that it burdens religious beliefs.        
   Thus, the medical exemption available as to all mandatory vaccines required 

by Maine law does not reflect a value judgment unfairly favoring secular interests 
over religious interests.  As an integral part of the vaccine requirement itself, the 
medical exemption for healthcare workers does not undermine the vaccine mandate’s 
general applicability.  The amended complaint does not plead any facts that plausibly 

support  the  conclusion  that  the  COVID-19  vaccine  mandate  is  not  generally 
applicable.  Because the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is both neutral and generally 
applicable, rational basis review applies.                                
   c.  Rational Basis Review                                            
   “A law survives rational basis review so long as the law is rationally related to 
a legitimate governmental interest.”  Cook v. Gates, 528 F.3d 42, 55 (1st Cir. 2008).  

Thus,  the  Plaintiffs  must  plead  facts  to  plausibly  support  a  claim  that  “the 
governmental  infringement  is  not  rationally  related  to  a  legitimate  government 
purpose.”  Mulero-Carrillo v. Román-Hernández, 790 F.3d 99, 107 (1st Cir. 2015).  For 
the following reasons, I conclude that the Plaintiffs have not pled facts that plausibly 
support their claim that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is not rationally related to a 
legitimate government interest.                                           
   As described previously, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate’s purpose is threefold: 

(1) “to protect the health and lives of Maine people,” (2) to “safeguard Maine’s health 
care capacity,” and (3) to “limit the spread of the [COVID-19] virus.”  ECF No. 1-1 at 
1 (Press Release from Governor Mills’s office announcing the Rule).  As the Supreme 
Court has observed, curbing the spread of COVID-19 is “unquestionably a compelling 
interest.”  Roman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 62, 67 (2020) (per 
curiam).    An  unquestionably  compelling  interest  is  inherently  legitimate.  
Safeguarding Maine’s healthcare delivery capacity and protecting the health and 
lives of Maine people are also legitimate government interests.           
   The Plaintiffs make a single, unsupported assertion in the amended complaint 

challenging  the  government’s  interest:    “There  is  no  legitimate,  rational,  or 
compelling interest in the Governor’s COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate’s exclusion of 
exemptions and accommodations for sincerely held religious beliefs.”  ECF No. 152 
¶ 124.  The Plaintiffs do not elaborate on this argument in their memorandum.  This 
conclusory statement does not present any facts which cast doubt on the legitimacy 
of the Government’s asserted interests in the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.   

   Reducing  the  number  of  unvaccinated  healthcare  workers  at  designated 
healthcare facilities in Maine is rationally related to the Government’s interests in 
limiting the spread of COVID-19, safeguarding Maine’s healthcare capacity, and 
protecting  the  lives  and  health  of  Maine  people.    Thus,  the  COVID-19  vaccine 
mandate is rationally related to the asserted legitimate governmental interests.  For 
this reason, the Free Exercise claim is properly dismissed.               
   4.  Equal Protection Clause                                          

   The  amended  complaint  asserts  that  the  COVID-19  vaccine  mandate 
impermissibly  creates  a  class  of  religious  objectors  and  then  subjects  them  to 
disparate treatment, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  “[W]here a law 
subject to an equal protection challenge ‘does not violate [a plaintiff’s] right of free 
exercise of religion,’ courts do not ‘apply to the challenged classification a standard of 
scrutiny stricter than the traditional rational-basis test.’” W.D., 521 F. Supp. 3d at 

410 (second alteration in original) (quoting A.M. ex rel. Messineo v. French, 431 F. 
Supp. 3d 432, 446 (D. Vt. 2019)); accord Wirzburger v. Galvin, 412 F.3d 271, 282-83 
(1st Cir. 2005) (“Because we [hold] that the [challenged law] does not violate the Free 
Exercise Clause, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the fundamental rights based 

claim that [the law] violates equal protection.”).                        
   Because I have determined that the vaccine mandate is rationally based, no 
further analysis is required, and the amended complaint’s Equal Protection claim is 
appropriately dismissed.                                                  
   5.  Supremacy Clause                                                 
   The amended complaint also asserts that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate 

violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2, 
because the mandate purportedly violates the anti-discrimination provisions of Title 
VII.                                                                      
   The Supremacy Clause “is not the ‘source of any federal rights,’ and certainly 
does not create a cause of action.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 
320, 324-25 (2015) (quoting Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, 493 
U.S. 103, 107 (1989)).  Rather, the Supremacy Clause “creates a rule of decision” that 

“instructs courts what to do when state and federal law clash.”  Id.  As explained in 
the analysis of the Plaintiffs’ Title VII claim, state and federal law do not clash here, 
and the mandate does not violate Title VII.                               
   Accordingly, the amended complaint’s claim under the Supremacy Clause that 
the Defendants “attempt[ed] to make Maine law supersede federal law,” ECF No. 152 
at 32, is appropriately dismissed as to all Defendants.                   
   6.   Unlawful Conspiracy to Violate Plaintiffs’ Civil Rights in      
         Violation of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985                                

   “A civil rights conspiracy as commonly defined is ‘a combination of two or more 
persons acting in concert to commit an unlawful act . . . the principal element of which 
is  an  agreement  between  the  parties  to  inflict  a  wrong  against  or  injury  upon 
another.’”  Parker v. Landry, 935 F.3d 9, 17 (1st Cir. 2019) (quoting Est. of Bennett v. 
Wainwright, 548 F.3d 155, 178 (1st Cir. 2008)).  To plead a civil rights conspiracy in 
violation of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985, a Plaintiff must “allege that the purpose of the 
conspiracy is ‘to deprive the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws,’ describe at 
least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and ‘show either injury to person 
or property, or a deprivation of a constitutionally protected right.’”  Alston v. Spiegel, 
988 F.3d 564, 577 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting Pérez-Sánchez v. Pub. Bldg. Auth., 531 F.3d 
104, 107 (1st Cir. 2008)).                                                

   The  amended  complaint  asserts  that  the  State  and  Hospital  Defendants 
conspired to violate the Plaintiffs’ civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985, but 
provides only conclusory, nonfactual allegations in support.  The primary assertion 
made in support of the conspiracy claim is that the Hospital Defendants made public 
statements that were supportive of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate after it was 
announced, and that the Hospital Defendants subsequently refused to grant religious 
exemptions from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement.  The amended complaint 

postulates that this public demonstration of support following the announcement of 
the Rule shows that the State and Hospital Defendants had agreed to deprive the 
Plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected rights to free exercise of religion and to 
equal protection of the laws.                                             
   The Plaintiffs’ contention that the Hospital Defendants’ expression of support 

for  the  Rule  following  its  adoption  constitutes  evidence  of  a  civil  conspiracy  is 
implausible.  “Vague and conclusory allegations about persons working together, with 
scant specifics as to the nature of their joint effort or the formation of their agreement, 
will  not  suffice  to  defeat  a  motion  to  dismiss”  regarding  a  claimed  civil  rights 
conspiracy.  Alston, 988 F.3d at 578.  As the First Circuit observed in its review of my 
earlier denial of the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, the Plaintiffs here 

“do not allege that the hospitals had any role in the amendment of the statute or 
issuance of the regulation, only that they supported the regulation after the fact.”  
Does 1-6 v. Mills, 16 F.4th at 37.  Because the Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts 
that, if proven, could demonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, the § 1985 claim is 
dismissed.                                                                
                      III.  CONCLUSION                                  
   For the reasons stated above, the State and Hospital Defendants’ Motions to 

Dismiss (ECF Nos. 107, 108, 109) are GRANTED.                             
   SO ORDERED.

     ORDER ON MOTION TO STAY PENDING APPEAL                          

On May 31, 2022, I granted a Motion to Unseal the Plaintiffs’ Identities (ECF 
No. 131) filed by two media companies—MTM Acquisition, Inc., d/b/a Portland Press 
Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, Kennebec Journal, and Morning Sentinel, and SJ 
Acquisition, Inc., d/b/a Sun Journal (collectively, the “Media Intervenors”).  The 
Media  Intervenors  were  granted  leave  to  intervene  for  the  limited  purpose  of 
challenging the Plaintiffs’ use of pseudonyms in this matter (ECF No. 95).  The 
Plaintiffs have appealed the May 31 order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First 
Circuit (ECF No. 132), and now seek a stay of proceedings in this Court or, in the 
alternative, a stay of this Court’s order requiring disclosure of Plaintiffs’ identities 
while their appeal is pending (ECF No. 138).                              
The Defendants—Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center (“EMHS”); 
Janet T. Mills, Governor of the State of Maine, Jeanne M. Lambrew, Commissioner 
of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (“Department), and Dr. 
Nirav D. Shah, Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control (Maine CDC) 
(collectively, “State Defendants”); and MaineHealth, Genesis Healthcare of Maine, 
LLC, Genesis Healthcare LLC, and MaineGeneral Health—all oppose a stay of the 
proceedings (ECF Nos. 141, 142, 143).  EMHS (ECF No. 141) opposes both a stay of 

the proceedings and a stay of the May 31 order.  The Media Intervenors (ECF No. 
139) oppose a stay of the May 31 order.                                   
                   I.  BACKGROUND                                    
The factual background of this action is set forth in my prior orders granting 
the Media Intervenors’ motion to unseal the Plaintiffs’ identities, see Does 1-6 v. Mills, 
No. 1:21-cv-242, 2022 WL 1747848, at *1 (D. Me. May 31, 2022), and denying the 

Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction, see Does 1-6 v. Mills, No. 1:21-cv-00242, 
2021 WL 4783626, at *2-4 (D. Me. Oct. 13, 2021).                          
                    II.  DISCUSSION                                  
A district court considers four factors when determining whether to grant a 
stay of a civil judgment or proceedings pending appeal: “(1) [W]hether the stay 
applicant has made a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) 
whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance 

of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; 
and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Bos. Parent Coal. for Acad. Excellence Corp. 
v. Sch. Comm. of City of Bos., 996 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting Nken, 556 U.S. 
at 434).  In addition, for the reasons set forth in my order granting the Media 
Intervenors’ Motion to Unseal the Plaintiffs’ Identities, I conclude that the Plaintiffs 
have not made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits.  I also 

conclude that the Plaintiffs will not be irreparably injured absent a stay.  Finally, for 
the reasons addressed in both previous orders, I conclude that the requested stay 
would substantially injure the interests of the Media Intervenors and would be 
contrary to the public interest.                                          

Although  I  conclude  that  the  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  demonstrate  their 
entitlement to a stay of the proceedings or a stay of the Court’s May 31, 2022, order 
granting the Media Intervenors’ Motion to Unseal the Plaintiffs’ Identities, I will 
delay the effective date of the order for an additional 21 days to permit the Plaintiffs 
more time to seek relief from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Appellate Procedure 8(a) (permitting the filing of a motion to stay an order of the 

district court pending appeal directly with the court of appeals when “the district 
court has denied the motion or failed to afford the relief requested”).   
                   III.  CONCLUSION                                  
For the reasons stated above, the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Stay Proceedings (ECF 
No. 138) is DENIED.  The Order to Unseal Plaintiffs’ Identities (ECF No. 131) is 
hereby  MODIFIED,  and  it  is  ORDERED  that  the  Plaintiffs  shall  file  a  first 
amended complaint, by July 8, 2022, identifying by name those individual Plaintiffs 

who elect to proceed as named and identified Plaintiffs in this action.   
SO ORDERED.

    ORDER ON MOTION TO UNSEAL PLAINTIFFS’ IDENTITIES                    

   The  Plaintiffs  are  eight  Maine  healthcare  workers  and  one  individual 
healthcare provider who challenge an August 2021 change to Maine law that requires 
employees of designated Maine healthcare facilities to be vaccinated against the 
COVID-19 coronavirus.  The complaint (ECF No. 1) also names Plaintiffs Jack Does 
1 through 1000 and Joan Does 1 through 1000 as putative plaintiffs who have not yet 
been joined in the action.  Two media companies—MTM Acquisition, Inc., d/b/a 
Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, Kennebec Journal, and Morning 
Sentinel,  and  SJ  Acquisition,  Inc.,  d/b/a  Sun  Journal  (collectively,  the  “Media 
Intervenors”)—were granted leave to intervene for the limited purpose of challenging 
the Plaintiffs’ use of pseudonyms in this matter (ECF No. 95).  The Media Intervenors 
now seek an order unsealing the Plaintiffs’ identities (ECF No. 105), arguing that the 
Plaintiffs should not continue to be permitted to proceed pseudonymously because 
the Plaintiffs’ alleged fear of harm no longer outweighs the public’s interest in open 
legal proceedings.  The Plaintiffs oppose the motion (ECF No. 110).  The Defendants—
three Maine officials and five private healthcare corporations—take no position (ECF 
Nos. 86, 88).  For the following reasons, I grant the Media Intervenors’ motion. 
                      I.  BACKGROUND                                    

   The factual background of this action is set forth in greater detail in my prior 
order denying the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  See Does 1-6 v. Mills, 
No. 1:21-cv-00242, 2021 WL 4783626, at *2-4 (D. Me. Oct. 13, 2021).       
   At the outset of this litigation, the Plaintiffs moved to proceed pseudonymously 
(ECF No. 21), contending that their reasonable fear of harm if their identities were 
revealed outweighed the public’s interest in open litigation.  I granted the Plaintiffs’ 

motion in part after taking judicial notice of the substantial public controversy that 
surrounded COVID-19 vaccination mandates at the time, but I reserved the authority 
to revisit the issue if the case proceeded beyond the preliminary-injunction stage.1  
Does 1-6 v. Mills, No. 1:21-cv-00242, 2021 WL 4005985, at *2-3 (D. Me. Sept. 2, 2021).  
I subsequently denied the Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunction on October 
13, 2021, Does 1-6 v. Mills, 2021 WL 4783626, at *18, which was affirmed by the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Does 1-6 v. Mills, 16 F.4th 20, 37 (1st Cir. 2021), 

application for injunctive relief denied sub nom. Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S. Ct. 17 (2021).  
The Plaintiffs then sought a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court, 
which was denied.  Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S. Ct. 1112 (2022).  Thus, the preliminary-
injunction phase of the litigation has concluded and the question of whether, moving 

1 The motion was granted in part to permit the Plaintiffs to proceed pseudonymously as to the public 
but denied as to Plaintiffs’ request to conceal their identities from the State Defendants’ counsel of 
record, the individual State Defendants, and State employees with knowledge of the facts alleged in 
the complaint and who were determined by State Defendants’ counsel to be reasonably necessary to 
respond to the Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  Does 1-6 v. Mills, No. 1:21-cv-00242, 2021 
forward, the Plaintiffs should be permitted to proceed pseudonymously is properly 
revisited.                                                                
                        II.  ANALYSIS                                   

   I begin by examining the general principles governing the circumstances under 
which parties may be permitted to proceed pseudonymously.  I will then turn to 
address the parties’ arguments for and against pseudonymity.              
A.   General Principles                                                   
   The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that all parties be named in the 
caption of a complaint and do not provide a mechanism for pseudonymous litigation.  

Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(a) (“The title of the complaint must name all the parties . . . .”); Doe 
v. Trs. of Dartmouth Coll., Civil No. 18-cv-040, 2018 WL 2048385, at *2 (D.N.H. May 
2, 2018).  “This rule serves more than administrative convenience.” Plaintiff B v. 
Francis, 631 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Doe v. Frank, 951 F.2d 320, 
322 (11th Cir. 1992)).  “It protects the public’s legitimate interest in knowing all of 
the facts involved, including the identities of the parties.”  Id. (quoting Frank, 951 
F.2d at 322).  Additionally, “[t]here is a strong common law presumption favoring 

public access to judicial proceedings and records,” and in general, a case must proceed 
in the actual names of the parties.  Doe v. Reg’l Sch. Unit No. 21, No. 2:19-00341, 
2020 WL 2833248, at *1 (D. Me. May 29, 2020) (quoting Flanders v. Maine, No. 2:12-
cv-00277, 2019 WL 2929500, at *2 (D. Me. July 8, 2019)).  In the context of public 
access to judicial records and documents, the First Circuit has repeatedly explained 
that such access “allows the citizenry to ‘monitor the functioning of our courts, 

thereby insuring quality, honesty and respect for our legal system.’”  Nat’l Org. for 
Marriage v. McKee, 649 F.3d 34, 70 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting FTC v. Standard Fin. 
Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 410 (1st Cir. 1987)).  In addition to the common law 
presumption of public access, courts have generally acknowledged the existence of a 

qualified First Amendment right of access to certain proceedings and documents in 
criminal cases, and likely in civil cases as well.  See Courthouse News Serv. v. 
Quinlan, 32 F.4th 15, 20 & nn.7-8 (1st Cir. 2022) (explaining that although neither 
the Supreme Court nor the First Circuit has recognized a First Amendment right to 
access documents filed in civil cases, other circuits that have considered the question 
have concluded that a qualified right exists).                            

   However,  Federal  courts  permit  plaintiffs  in  civil  suits  to  proceed 
pseudonymously in “exceptional cases.”  Doe v. Megless, 654 F.3d 404, 408 (3d Cir. 
2011).  An exceptional case may exist where the party seeking pseudonymity “‘has a 
substantial  privacy  right  which  outweighs  the  customary  and  constitutionally

   Courts in the First Circuit addressing motions to proceed pseudonymously 
have also applied the Third Circuit’s multi-factor test set forth in Megless, which 
identifies nine factors to be considered.  See Reg’l Sch. Unit No. 21, 2020 WL 2833248, 
at *2; Trs. of Dartmouth Coll., 2018 WL 2048385, at *4-5.2  The Megless decision 


2 Neither the Supreme Court nor the First Circuit has delineated a test to determine whether 
pseudonymity of parties should be permitted; however, other circuits have set out multi-factor tests 
identified  six  factors  that  weigh  in  favor  of  allowing  a  litigant  to  proceed 
pseudonymously:                                                           
   (1)  the  extent  to  which  the  identity  of  the  litigant  has  been  kept 
   confidential; (2) the bases upon which disclosure is feared or sought to 
   be avoided, and the substantiality of these bases; (3) the magnitude of 
   the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the litigant’s 
   identity; (4) whether, because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
   presented or otherwise, there is an atypically weak public interest in 
   knowing the litigant’s identities; (5) the undesirability of an outcome 
   adverse to the pseudonymous party and attributable to his refusal to 
   pursue the case at the price of being publicly identified; and (6) whether 
   the  party  seeking  to  sue  pseudonymously  has  illegitimate  ulterior 
   motives.                                                             

654 F.3d at 409 (quoting Doe v. Provident Life & Accident Ins., 176 F.R.D. 464, 467-
68 (E.D. Pa. 1997)).  In contrast, three other factors weigh against pseudonymity: 
   [(7)] the universal level of public interest in access to the identities of 
   litigants; [(8)] whether, because of the subject matter of this litigation, 
   the status of the litigant as a public figure, or otherwise, there is a 
   particularly strong interest in knowing the litigant’s identities, beyond 
   the public’s interest which is normally obtained; and [(9)] whether the 
   opposition  to  pseudonym  by  counsel,  the  public,  or  the  press  is 
   illegitimately motivated.                                            

Id. (quoting Provident Life, 176 F.R.D. at 468).  As the Megless court explained, the 
ultimate purpose of this and similar factor-based balancing tests is to enable the court 
to decide “whether a litigant has a reasonable fear of severe harm that outweighs the 
public’s interest in open litigation.”  654 F.3d at 409.                  

requiring pseudonymity.  See Doe v. Stegall, 653 F.2d 180, 185-86 (5th Cir. 1981) (identifying four 
factors, including whether the plaintiff would be required to disclose information “of the utmost 
intimacy,” to be considered when a plaintiff seeks to proceed pseudonymously); Does I thru XXIII v. 
Advanced  Textile  Corp.,  214  F.3d  1058,  1068-69  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (adopting  a  five-factor  test 
incorporating several of the Stegall factors, as well as the severity of the threatened harm and 
reasonableness of the moving party’s fear of that harm); Sealed Plaintiff v. Sealed Defendant #1, 537 
F.3d 185, 188-90 (2d Cir. 2008) (reviewing balancing tests developed in other circuits and adding 
several factors to the Ninth Circuit’s test).  At the oral argument held on May 4, 2022, the parties 
agreed that Megless provides a workable framework for this Court’s analysis; thus, I apply the Megless 
   Both parties also cite to the growing body of recent decisions from other trial 
courts addressing requests for, and challenges to, pseudonymity in COVID-19-related 
cases, which have reached varying results.3  I have considered these decisions and 

find them instructive; however, none are determinative given the unique issues and 
facts presented by the case at hand.                                      
B.   The Privacy Interests Presented in this Case                         
   The Plaintiffs assert that they have substantial privacy interests in their 
religious beliefs opposing the COVID-19 vaccine and their resulting medical decisions 
to refuse the vaccine.  These interests, they assert, are inextricably intertwined with 

one another and support shielding their identities from public disclosure.  I consider 
this  argument  primarily  under  the  second  Megless  factor,  which  requires  an 
assessment of the reasons the Plaintiffs fear the public disclosure of their identities 
and the substantiality of those reasons.                                  
   As alleged in the complaint, the Plaintiffs’ reason for refusing the COVID-19 
vaccination is rooted in their religious-based objection to abortion and their assertion

plaintiffs’ request to proceed pseudonymously in a challenge to a government COVID-19 vaccine 
mandate because the vaccination decision is not “highly sensitive” even when that choice is faith based, 
and concluding that criticism and ostracism are not equivalent to a real danger of physical harm), and 
Doe v. City Univ. of N.Y., No. 21 Civ. 9544, 2021 WL 5644642, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2021) (denying 
the plaintiff’s request to proceed pseudonymously in challenging his college’s COVID-19 vaccination 
policy because he did not “me[e]t his burden of demonstrating that his ‘interest in anonymity’ 
outweighs the prejudice to defendants and ‘the customary and constitutionally-embedded presumption 
that fetal stem cells were used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines.  I take 
judicial notice of the fact that the Plaintiffs’ religious-based opposition to abortion is 
a belief held by many Americans and is associated with a longstanding public debate 

concerning the use of fetal cells for medical and scientific purposes.  See generally 
Inst. of Med. (US) Conf. Comm. on Fetal Rsch. and Applications, Setting the Stage: 
Fetal Research, Fetal Tissue Research, and Historical Timeline of Regulation and 
Legislation  (2004),  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK231997.    Accordingly, 
and contrary to the Plaintiffs’ position,  I treat the religious beliefs underlying the 
Plaintiffs’  opposition  to  mandatory  COVID-19  vaccinations  as  not  so  highly 

controversial or unique as to subject the Plaintiffs to a reasonable fear of severe harm 
if their identities are revealed.                                         
   The same is true with respect to the Plaintiffs’ unvaccinated status.  A person’s 
decision to receive or refuse a vaccine is not on par with the intimate medical or 
psychiatric  matters  that  have  traditionally  been  protected  by  pseudonymous 
proceedings.  As one court recently characterized it “vaccination status simply is not 
at that level.”  Air Force Officer v. Austin, CIVIL ACTION NO. 5:22-cv-00009, 2022 

WL 468030, at *2 (M.D. Ga. Feb. 15, 2022) (quoting Coker v. Austin, No. 3:21-cv-
01211, slip op. at 4 (N.D. Fla. Dec. 1, 2021), ECF No. 49).  Vaccinations and the need 
to provide proof of vaccination status have become commonplace in modern times.  
See Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47 J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 656 (1995) (“[p]ublic school 
children are routinely required to . . . be vaccinated against various diseases.”); see 
also Drew DeSilver, States Have Mandated Vaccinations Since Long Before COVID-

19,  Pew  Research  Center  (Oct.  8,  2021),  https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-
tank/2021/10/08/states-have-mandated-vaccinations-since-long-before-covid-19/.  
Thus, a person’s unvaccinated status—whether in relation to COVID-19 or some 
other infectious disease for which a vaccine is publicly mandated—is not in and of 

itself  an  inherently  private,  highly  sensitive  medical  condition  that  calls  for 
pseudonymity.  See, e.g., Doe v. City Univ. of N.Y., No. 21 Civ. 9544, 2021 WL 
5644642, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2021) (concluding that “there is no independent 
medical issue separate and apart from plaintiff’s refusal to receive a COVID-19 
vaccine on religious grounds” and that “[u]nder these circumstances, relying on a 
medical issue as a basis for anonymity does not withstand analysis”); Bd. of Regents 

of Univ. of Colo., 2022 WL 43897, at *3 (finding that, “standing alone, a medical 
condition  that  is  described  as  unvaccinated  against  COVID-19  is  not  so  highly 
sensitive and personal in nature as to overcome the presumption of openness in 
judicial proceedings”).4                                                  
   The Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs and their resulting medical decisions not to be 
vaccinated against COVID-19, whether considered separately or together, do not 
present privacy interests so substantial as to support pseudonymous proceedings.   

C.   Risk of Severe Harm to Plaintiffs if Their Identities are Unsealed   

   The Plaintiffs also contend that the heightened public passions concerning 
mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations place them at a heightened risk of severe social 
stigma and worse if their identities are publicly revealed.  I consider this argument 
under the both the second and third Megless factors.  The third factor examines the 

4 To the extent that there are sensitive medical records or information that may be relevant to this 
magnitude of the public’s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the litigants’ 
identities, as there is undeniably a strong public interest in protecting litigants’ 
identities if they would face harm if their identities were publicized.   

   The primary evidentiary support the Plaintiffs’ have offered in support of 
maintaining their anonymity is the declaration of their attorney, Daniel J. Schmid, 
which was originally submitted (ECF No. 21-1) with the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Proceed 
Using a Pseudonym (ECF No. 21) in August 2021.5  Paragraph seven of the Schmid 
Declaration provides the most specific factual support for the Plaintiffs’ argument 
concerning their fear of social stigmatization.  It includes the following quotes from 

anonymous on-line comments made in response to a Bangor Daily News article 
published on August 25, 2021, regarding this lawsuit:                     
   Anyway,  Church  Lady,  what’s  this  Constitution  thingy  people  are 
   referring to all the time.                                           

   Anyway Church Lady, what’s this lawsuit about again?                 

   Well one would have to wonder if the above is really true since both these 
   deplorable  ‘Christian’  sociopathic  groups  see  no  harm  in  placing 
   innocents at risk of serious long term health problems or death.     

   These people turn my stomach!  Somebody’s fake religion has nothing to 
   do with our health.  Such a lawsuit shouldn’t even be considered by the 
   court.  In fact, maybe as citizen, Americans ought to be suing the fools 
   who put this lawsuit together.                                       

   The Liberty Counsel is the Christian American Taliban.               

   This  dangerous  and  deadly  public  health  matter  presents  an   
   opportunity to further control those who look to [religion] for spiritual 
   nourishment.                                                         

5 I do not consider additional factual allegations made by Attorney Roger K. Gannam in the Plaintiffs’ 
memorandum of law (ECF No. 110) dated February 28, 2022.  The memorandum of law is not verified 
and largely fails to identify the  speaker, date, or source of each of the  statements quoted or 
   When your choice endangers everyone around you, you are a public     
   threat, and should be incarcerated, just as you would be if you were 
   firing a gun at random in a crowd.                                   

ECF No. 21-1 ¶ 7 (alteration in original) (emphases omitted).             
   Some of these comments express hostility toward the Plaintiffs’ opposition to 
being vaccinated against COVID-19, but they do not contain any direct or indirect 
threats of harm against the Plaintiffs or others.  Hostile and arguably intemperate 
comments of this sort are often part of the public discourse litigants encounter when 
they  turn  to  a  public  forum,  such  as  a  court,  seeking  redress  of  their  federal 
constitutional  and  statutory  rights.    The  comments  cited  in  Attorney  Schmid’s 
declaration do not demonstrate that the social ostracization Plaintiffs could face if 
their identities are made known to the public is so substantial as to constitute a 
reasonable fear of severe harm.                                           
   Further, the information contained in the Schmid Declaration does not allow 
for a meaningful evaluation of specific adverse consequences or threats that can 
reasonably be expected from the public disclosure of the Plaintiffs’ identities.  The 
individual Plaintiffs themselves have not submitted declarations which allow for an 
assessment of the harm or harms they fear if their identities are revealed.  In 
addition,  although  the  Schmid  Declaration  asserts  that,  as  of  August  2021,  an 
unspecified number of the Plaintiffs would remove themselves from this action if their 

identities were disclosed to their employers and to the public, the record reflects that 
none  of  the  Plaintiffs  withdrew  from  this  case  following  the  court-authorized 
disclosure of their identities to their employers in December 2021 (ECF No. 94).   
   The Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the public controversy associated 
with mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations will result in the Plaintiffs being socially 
stigmatized to a substantial degree if the Plaintiffs’ identities are publicly revealed. 

D.   Consideration of the Additional Relevant Megless Factors             
   I now turn to several additional Megless factors relevant to the circumstances 
of this case.6                                                            
   The Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence regarding the extent to which 
they have kept their identities and connection to this case shielded from family, 
friends, and their respective communities, as is required for an evaluation of the first 

Megless factor.                                                           
   As to the fourth factor—whether there is an atypically weak public interest in 
knowing the litigants’ identities because of the purely legal nature of the issues 
presented—the  Plaintiffs  contend  that  because  the  issues  presented  by  their 
complaint are purely legal and not factual in nature, the public’s interest in their 
identities is nominal.  This argument ignores that the complaint includes as-applied 
challenges to Maine’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate.  For example, the complaint 

asserts that “[t]he Governor’s COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate, on its face and as applied, 
places Plaintiffs in an irresolvable conflict between compliance with the mandate and 
their sincerely held religious beliefs.”  ECF No. 1 ¶ 128 (emphasis added).  By 
challenging the actions of the private hospital employers, the Plaintiffs have, as 

6  Several of the Megless factors are inapplicable here.  Neither party has argued that the sixth or 
ninth factors, which assess whether the party bringing suit has illegitimate ulterior motives for 
seeking pseudonymity or whether the party opposing pseudonymity does so for illegitimate motives, 
are at issue here and so I do not consider these factors.  The Plaintiffs also do not argue that they seek 
pseudonymity because they wish to protect their identities if the outcome of the case is adverse to their 
another court has recently recognized in a case involving similar claims, “put factual 
questions about [their own] actions at issue in this lawsuit.”  City Univ. of N.Y., 2021 
WL  5644642, at  *  5.   The  complaint  asserts  employment  discrimination  claims 

against the Plaintiffs’ private hospital employers under Title VII.  The Title VII 
claims made against the private healthcare provider Defendants will necessarily 
require  consideration  of  facts  associated  with  each  Plaintiff’s  employment 
circumstances, specific accommodation request, and credibility.           
   The seventh and eighth Megless factors together assess the level and strength 
of the public’s interest in knowing the Plaintiffs’ identities.  The level of public 

interest in the subject matter of this case is high because the Plaintiffs seek to 
invalidate a mandatory vaccination requirement for healthcare workers adopted in 
response to a nationwide pandemic.  The statewide effectiveness of the public health 
response to the pandemic is an important matter and, consequently, is of great public 
interest.  In addition, the Plaintiffs’ employment discrimination, as-applied claims 
against the private healthcare provider Defendants—operators of several of Maine’s 
largest healthcare systems—suggests that there is a strong public interest in the 

identities, occupations and accommodation requests of potentially hundreds or even 
thousands of Maine healthcare workers who would be exempt from the mandatory 
vaccination requirement if the Plaintiffs prevail in this action.         
                      III.  CONCLUSION                                  
   For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs have not shown that their fear of 
severe harm if their identities are revealed is objectively reasonable.  To be clear, 

there  is  no  reason  to  doubt  the  sincerity  of  the  Plaintiffs’  generally  expressed 
subjective fears or to infer that their effort to shield their identities results from 
ulterior motives.  In the final analysis, however, there is a near total absence of proof 
that their expressed fears are objectively reasonable.  On this record, the Plaintiffs’ 

privacy interests have not been shown to outweigh the public interest associated with 
the presumption of openness that applies to civil proceedings.            
   Having carefully weighed the relevant factors, I conclude that the Plaintiffs 
have not met their high burden of showing a need to overcome the strong presumption 
favoring public access to civil proceedings, as required for them to continue to proceed 
pseudonymously.  The Media Intervenor’s Motion to Unseal Plaintiffs’ Identities 

(ECF No. 105) is GRANTED.  It is ORDERED that the Plaintiffs shall file a first 
amended complaint, by June 7, 2022 identifying by name those individual Plaintiffs 
who elect to proceed as named and identified Plaintiffs in this action.

              ORDER ON MOTION TO STAY                                

The Plaintiffs, Jane Does 1-6 and others, seek to stay all proceedings in this 
Court (ECF No. 81) pending the resolution of their petition to the United States 
Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.  The 
Plaintiffs argue that a stay would conserve judicial resources while the Supreme 
Court considers questions that could shape the course of this litigation.  Defendants 
Janet T. Mills, Governor of the State of Maine; Jeanne M. Lambrew, Commissioner 
of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services; and Dr. Nirav D. Shah 
(collectively,  “State  Defendants”)  oppose  the  Plaintiffs’  motion  (ECF  No.  85).  
Defendants MaineHealth; Genesis Healthcare of Maine, LLC; Genesis Healthcare, 
LLC;  and  MaineGeneral  Health  (collectively,  “MaineHealth-Genesis  Provider 
Defendants”) also oppose the motion (ECF No. 87).  Defendant Northern Light Health 
Foundation takes no position (ECF No. 86).  After careful consideration and for the 
reasons that follow, I deny the Plaintiffs’ motion (ECF No. 81).          
                   I.  BACKGROUND                                    
My earlier Order denying the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction sets 
forth in detail the facts underlying this case and the events leading to that Order.  

Does v. Mills, No. 1:21-cv-00242, 2021 WL 4783626, at *2-5 (D. Me. Oct. 13, 2021).  
Subsequent to that Order, on October 14, 2021, the Plaintiffs filed an emergency 
motion for an injunction pending appeal to the First Circuit, which was denied.  Does 
1-3 v. Mills, No. 21-1826, 2021 WL 4845812 (1st Cir. Oct. 15, 2021) (mem).  The First 
Circuit also affirmed this Court’s denial of the preliminary injunction.  Does 1-6 v. 
Mills, 16 F.4th 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2021).  The Plaintiffs then sought injunctive relief from 

the Supreme Court, which was denied on October 29, 2021.  Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S. 
Ct. 17 (2021) (mem).  On November 11, 2021, the Plaintiffs filed a petition to the 
United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to the First Circuit Court of 
Appeals (ECF No. 81-1).  The Plaintiffs also filed a motion to expedite the Supreme 
Court’s consideration of their petition (ECF No. 81-2), which was denied on December 
6, 2021.  Does 1-3 v. Mills, No. 21-717, 2021 WL 5763094 (U.S. Dec. 6, 2021) (mem).  
                    II.  DISCUSSION                                  

The determination of whether to grant a stay of proceedings in this case is 
discretionary, as “[a] district court enjoys inherent power to ‘control the disposition of 
the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for 
litigants.’”  City of Bangor v. Citizens Commc’ns Co., 532 F.3d 70, 99 (1st Cir. 2008) 
(quoting Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936)).  “‘A stay is an intrusion into 
the ordinary process of administration and judicial review,’ and is therefore ‘not a 

matter of right,’ but rather is an exercise of discretion.”  Katz v. Liberty Power Corp., 
No. 18-cv-10506, 2020 WL 3440886, at *3 (D. Mass. June 23, 2020) (quoting Nken v. 
Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 427 (2009)).                                        
The First Circuit has cautioned that “stays cannot be cavalierly dispensed: 

there must be good cause for their issuance; they must be reasonable in duration; and 
the court must ensure that competing equities are weighed and balanced.”  Marquis 
v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1155 (1st Cir. 1992).  “The proponent of a stay bears the 
burden  of  establishing  its  need.”    Widi  v.  McNeil,  No.  2:12-cv-00188,  2013  WL 
5348628, at *3 (D. Me. Sept. 24, 2013) (quoting Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 708 
(1997)).                                                                  

A.   Good Cause                                                           
The Plaintiffs contend that good cause for a stay exists because the Supreme 
Court is likely to grant their petition for writ of certiorari, the case involves a 
substantial question of law that could be dispositive of the case, and a stay would 
prevent potentially unnecessary litigation on the merits.  For reasons I will explain, 
these arguments are unpersuasive.                                         
First, the Plaintiffs’ assertion that the Supreme Court is likely to grant the 

petition for writ of certiorari is unavailing.  They argue that although only three 
Supreme Court Justices voted to grant the injunctive relief they sought in this case,   
two additional Justices who had concurred in the denial explained that they did not 
want to analyze the issues raised by the Plaintiffs’ request in the context of an 
emergency application from one case.  The Plaintiffs argue that those two Justices 
will likely support review through the ordinary petition process now that similar 
litigation from the Second Circuit has also reached the Supreme Court through a 
petition for emergency relief.                                            
The Plaintiffs’ argument fails to account for the fact that the two Justices who 

declined  to  grant  the  requested  emergency  injunctive  relief  indicated  that  they 
viewed the case as a poor candidate for a grant of certiorari.  Justice Barrett cautioned 
against granting emergency relief where the applicant is unlikely to succeed on the 
merits because, “[w]ere the standard otherwise, applicants could use the emergency 
docket to force the Court to give a merits preview in cases that it would be unlikely 
to take.”  Does 1-3, 142 S. Ct. at 22 (Barrett, J., concurring).  Justice Kavanaugh 

joined in this opinion.  Although far from certain, Justices Barrett and Kavanaugh’s 
stated reason for denying emergency injunctive relief suggests that they will not 
support a grant of certiorari review.                                     
The Plaintiffs’ argument that good cause exists to stay the proceedings because 
a substantial question of law exists relies singularly on Justice Gorsuch’s dissent 
from the Supreme Court’s denial of their application for emergency injunctive relief.  
Justice Gorsuch wrote that “[t]his case presents an important constitutional question, 

a serious error, and an irreparable injury.”  Does 1-3, 142 S. Ct. at 22 (Gorsuch, J., 
dissenting).  The Plaintiffs characterize this statement as evidence that they are 
likely to be granted a writ of certiorari, and that good cause exists for this Court to 
grant a stay.                                                             
The  Plaintiffs’  argument  obscures  the  fact  that  Justice  Gorsuch  wrote  in 
dissent.    The  Plaintiffs  offer  no  support  for  the  proposition  that  at  least  three 

additional Justices agree with Justice Gorsuch’s assertion absent the development of 
a trial court record.  In addition, as this Court has previously observed, “[b]ased on 
sheer numbers, the likelihood that the United States Supreme Court will accept any 
case on certiorari is remote . . . especially in the absence of a conflict on the issue 

among circuit courts.”  U.S. v. Kenney, No. CR-07-66-B-W, 2008 WL 3285891, at *2 
(D. Me. Aug. 5, 2008).  Here, the two Circuit Courts to address the issues presented 
here have aligned in rejecting the arguments put forth by the Plaintiffs.  See Does 
1-6, 16 F.4th at 29-35; We The Patriots USA, Inc. v. Hochul, 17 F.4th 266, 280-90 (2d 
Cir. 2021).                                                               
The Plaintiffs also argue that because there were two similar New York cases 

pending review by the Supreme Court on requests for preliminary injunctive relief at 
the time the Plaintiffs filed their motion to stay proceedings, a merits review of their 
case is more likely.  However, since the Plaintiffs’ filing of their motion to stay 
proceedings, the Supreme Court has denied injunctive relief in the New York cases.  
This argument, therefore, lends no support for a stay of this case.       
Rather than showing that further development of this case at the trial court 
level  would  be  unnecessary,  the  Plaintiffs’  arguments,  considered  in  context, 

demonstrate  that  additional  development  of  the  record  is  needed  for  the  full 
evaluation of the merits of the Plaintiffs’ claims at both the trial and appellate levels.    
B.   Reasonable Duration                                                  
Next, the Plaintiffs argue that because they sought expedited review of the 
petition for writ of certiorari, and because the Supreme Court will hold its next case 
conference on January 7, 2022, the delay in proceedings resulting from the grant of a 

stay would be minimal.  However, on December 6, 2021, the Supreme Court denied 
the  Plaintiffs’  request  for  expedited  review.    Does  1-3,  2021  WL  5763094.  
Additionally, there is no guarantee that the Plaintiffs’ petition will be considered 
during the January 7, 2022 case conference.  The Plaintiffs have not demonstrated, 

beyond mere conjecture, that a stay, if granted, would be for a reasonable duration. 
C.   Weighing the Competing Equities                                      
The Plaintiffs argue that the equities weigh in their favor because granting a 
stay would benefit the Court and all parties by avoiding potentially unnecessary 
litigation costs.                                                         
In the context of evaluating a request for a stay of proceedings, “[l]itigation 

expenses, even a ‘substantial and unrecoupable cost,’” do not give rise to hardship or 
inequity requiring a stay in proceedings.  Katz, 2020 WL 3440886, at *4 (quoting 
Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 24 (1974)).  “[B]eing 
required to defend a suit, without more, does not constitute a ‘clear case of hardship 
or inequity’ within the meaning of Landis.”  Indep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal. v. Shewry, 
No. CV 08-3315 CAS, 2010 WL 11520551, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 17, 2010) (quoting 
Lockyer  v.  Mirant  Corp.,  398  F.3d  1098,  1112  (9th  Cir.  2005)).    The  Plaintiffs’ 

responsibility to pay foreseeable litigation costs associated with a civil action that 
they initiated does not, without more, give rise to unfair hardship or inequity. 
On  balance,  I  find  that  the  public’s  interest  in  the  speedy  and  just 
determination of civil proceedings, particularly a civil proceeding presenting issues 
of great public importance, favors the denial of the Plaintiffs’ stay request.  For 
reasons I have already explained, the path to the quickest and final resolution of 

those issues is the timely development of an evidentiary record by this court.   
D.   Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(1)                         
Noting that there is no specific rule that governs a petition to stay federal 
district court proceedings pending disposition of a petition for certiorari, the Plaintiffs 

also argue that a stay should be awarded in keeping with the requirements of Federal 
Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(1), which applies to petitions to stay the mandate 
of a circuit court pending filing of a petition for certiorari.  Under Appellate Rule 
41(d)(1), the litigant seeking a stay “must show that the petition would present a 
substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay.”  The MaineHealth-
Genesis Provider Defendants also suggest that the rule provides useful, nonbinding 

guidance for the exercise of this court’s discretion.                     
The  Plaintiffs  challenge  Maine’s  vaccine  mandate  on  First  Amendment 
grounds, arguing that the lack of religious exemption violates the Plaintiffs’ Free 
Exercise rights and that Title VII’s religious accommodation provisions preempt the 
vaccine mandate.  In their petition for a writ of certiorari, the Plaintiffs seek review 
of the First Circuit’s affirmance of my denial of a preliminary injunction against 
Maine’s vaccine mandate for healthcare workers.  Since the Plaintiffs’ petition for 

emergency injunctive relief was denied by the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court 
also rejected a request for emergency injunctive relief against a similar New York 
State vaccine mandate.  Dr. A v. Hochul, No. 21A145, 2021 WL 5873126 (U.S. Dec. 
13, 2021) (mem).  In Dr. A., as in this case, the circuit court denied injunctive relief.   
Accordingly, no circuit court has affirmed a preliminary injunction in a similar 
case, so there is no split of circuit authority that presents a substantial question for 

the Supreme Court to resolve.  The Supreme Court’s decisions have made clear that, 
at least at the preliminary injunction stage, a majority of the Justices do not view the 
First Amendment issue presented here as raising a substantial question in need of 
immediate resolution.  Additionally, as to the Title VII claims, the Plaintiffs have not 

argued that a substantial question exists.                                
Thus, the substantial question criterion of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 
41(d)(1) does not alter the conclusion that a stay is not warranted.      
                   III.  CONCLUSION                                  
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the Plaintiffs’  Motion to  Stay  (ECF  No. 81)  is 
DENIED.

           ORDER ON MOTION TO INTERVENE                              

On  September  2,  2021,  I  granted  the  Plaintiffs’  motion  to  proceed 
pseudonymously in this case.  Does 1-6 v. Mills, No. 1:21-cv-00242, 2021 WL 4005985, 
at *2 (D. Me. Sept. 2, 2021).  In that order, I reserved the authority to revisit the issue 
in the event the case proceeded beyond the preliminary injunction stage.  Id.  More 
recently,  two  media  companies—MTM  Acquisition,  Inc.,  d/b/a  Portland  Press 
Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, Kennebec Journal, and Morning Sentinel, and SJ 
Acquisition,  Inc.,  d/b/a  Sun  Journal  (the  “Media  Intervenors”)—have  moved  to 
intervene (ECF No. 76) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)-(b) for the 
limited  purpose  of  challenging  the  Plaintiffs’  ongoing  use  of  pseudonyms.    The 
Plaintiffs oppose the motion, while the Defendants take no position.      
                    I. LEGAL STANDARD                                
Intervention “is an effective mechanism for third-party claims of access to 
information generated through judicial proceedings.”  Pub. Citizen v. Liggett Grp., 
Inc., 858 F.2d 775, 783 (1st Cir. 1988).  Courts have discretion to allow permissive 
intervention pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) upon a timely showing 
that the “putative intervenor ‘has a claim or defense that shares with the main action 

a common question of law or fact.’”  Ne. Patients Grp. v. Me. Dep’t of Admin. & Fin. 
Servs., No. 1:20-cv-00468, 2021 WL 1135019, at *2 (D. Me. Mar. 23, 2021) (quoting 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B)).  When the party moving to intervene does so for a limited 
purpose and does not seek to become a party to the litigation, the nexus-of-fact-or-
law  requirement  is  loosened,  and  “[s]pecificity,  e.g.,  that  the  intervenors’  claim 
involve the same legal theory that was raised in the main action, is not required.”  
Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 778 (3d Cir. 1994) (alterations omitted) 

(quoting Beckman Indus., Inc. v. Int’l Ins., 966 F.2d 470, 474 (9th Cir. 1992)).  Instead, 
if a party seeks “to intervene in a case for the limited purpose of unsealing judicial 
records, most circuits have found that “there is no reason to require such a strong 
nexus of fact or law.”  Flynt v. Lombardi, 782 F.3d 963, 967 (8th Cir. 2015).  The 
district court also “must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or 
prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.”  T-Mobile Ne. LLC v. Town 

of Barnstable, 969 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2020) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(3)).  Within 
these parameters, “the district court . . . enjoys very broad discretion in granting or 
denying the motion.”  Daggett v. Comm’n on Governmental Ethics & Election Pracs., 
172 F.3d 104, 113 (1st Cir. 1999).                                        
Pseudonymous proceedings in federal court are generally disfavored because 
“‘[t]here  is  a  strong  common  law  presumption  favoring  public  access  to  judicial 
proceedings and records.’”  Flanders v. Maine, No. 2:12-cv-00277, 2019 WL 2929500, 
at *2 (D. Me. July 8, 2019) (slip copy) (quoting In re Salem Suede, Inc., 268 F.3d 42, 
45  (1st  Cir.  2001)).    This  Court  has  additionally  recognized  “a  qualified  First 

Amendment right of public access to civil complaints.”  Courthouse News Serv. V. 
Glessner, No. 1:21-cv-00040, 2021 WL 3024286, at *15 (D. Me. July 16, 2021).  Against 
this backdrop, I turn to consider the media companies’ motion.            
                    II. LEGAL ANALYSIS                               
The Media Intervenors’ motion is timely.  The preliminary injunction phase of 
this proceeding has concluded, and the Media Intervenors seek to intervene for the 
limited purpose of challenging the continued use of pseudonyms.  If pseudonymity 

continues, measures to restrict the public’s access to information would be necessary, 
including  sealing  and  redacting  records  and  closing  testimonial  proceedings.  
Accordingly, the circumstances of the litigation have changed such that the motion 
has been timely brought.                                                  
Nonetheless, the Plaintiffs resist the motion to intervene, arguing that it comes 
both too early, as protective measures such as sealing and redaction have not yet been 

requested or implemented, and too late, as the protective order issued three months 
ago.  These arguments are unavailing given my earlier reservation of authority to 
reconsider  the  protective  order  should  the  case  proceed  beyond  the  preliminary 
injunction stage.  Further, the Media Intervenors promptly brought their motion 
upon  the  conclusion  of  the  preliminary  injunction  proceedings.    The  nexus 
requirement is also satisfied because the Media Intervenors seek to intervene for the 
limited purpose of challenging the continued use of pseudonyms for the remainder of 
the litigation.  Pansy, 23 F.3d at 778 (“By virtue of the fact that the Newspapers 
challenge the validity of the Order of Confidentiality . . . they meet the requirement 

of Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(2) that their claim must have ‘a question of law or fact in 
common’ with the . . . action.”)                                          
The Plaintiffs also contend that allowing intervention will create undue delay 
and unfairly prejudice them because they are committed to filing an interlocutory 
appeal to challenge intervention if the Media Intervenors’ motion is granted, which 
will result in further delay.  Although an interlocutory appeal will no doubt extend 
the life of this litigation, that extension is neither undue nor unfairly prejudicial to 

the Plaintiffs’ interests.  It is the Plaintiffs, and not the Court, who will determine 
whether the added time and expense associated with an interlocutory appeal furthers 
their interests and is warranted.                                         
The Plaintiffs also argue that the motion should be denied because the Media 
Intervenors seek to challenge an issue not currently contested by either party.  This 
argument fails to account for the added factor that on a motion for permissive 

intervention,  courts  consider  “whether  the  ‘putative  intervenor’s  interest  is 
adequately represented by an existing party.’”  Massachusetts v. U.S. Dep’t of Health 
& Hum. Servs., 289 F. Supp. 3d 259, 265 (D. Mass. 2018) (quoting KG Urban Enters., 
LLC v. Patrick, 293 F.R.D. 42, 49 (D. Mass. 2013)).  Because the Media Intervenors 
seek to vindicate their and the public’s common law and First Amendment rights of 
access to judicial proceedings, and that interest is not currently represented by any 
of  the  parties,  this  consideration  weighs  in  favor  of  granting,  not  denying, 
intervention.                                                             
Finally, Plaintiffs assert that because the Media Intervenors did not separately 

file a pleading with their motion, they have not complied with Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 24(c) and the motion should be denied.  A party seeking to intervene must 
file a motion “accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which 
intervention is sought.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c). However, “the Court’s ultimate decision 
on intervention must be driven by the merits of the motion, especially when the record 
otherwise makes clear exactly what claims or defenses the proposed intervenor seeks 
to pursue or otherwise resolve.”  City of Bangor v. Citizen Commc’ns Co., No. 02-183-

B-S, 2007 WL 1557426, at *2 (D. Me. May 25, 2007), aff’d, 532 F.3d 70 (1st Cir. 2008) 
(holding that “there was no abuse of discretion in the district court’s decision to 
elevate substance over form” in excusing an intervenor from strict compliance with 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(c)).                                   
Here, no new claim or defense will be added to the existing suit if intervention 
is granted, nor will additional parties to the litigation be joined in relation to the 

merits of the Plaintiffs’ claims.  Thus, this is an instance in which a pleading is not 
necessary.  See Liggett Grp., 858 F.2d at 784 (“[F]ederal courts have been quite lenient 
in permitting participation by parties who failed to comply strictly with Rule 24.”).  
Because the motion for intervention fully explains the basis for intervention, and the 
Plaintiffs point to no tangible harm or prejudice resulting from the motion’s failure 
to be accompanied by a separate pleading, strict compliance with Rule 24(c) is not 
warranted.                                                                
                   III. CONCLUSION                                   

For the foregoing reasons, the Media Intervenor’s Motion to Intervene (ECF 
No. 76) is GRANTED.

 ORDER ON PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION                  


                       I.  INTRODUCTION                                  
    Plaintiffs, eight individual healthcare workers and one individual healthcare 
provider, seek a preliminary injunction (ECF No. 3) prohibiting Janet T. Mills, 
Maine’s Governor, and other named defendants from requiring all employees of 
designated  healthcare  facilities  to  be  vaccinated  against  the  SARS-CoV-2 
coronavirus—the cause of COVID-19 infections—through the enforcement of the rule, 
Immunization Requirements for Healthcare Workers, 10-144-264 Me. Code R. §§ 1-7 
(2021)1 (the “Rule”), as amended August 12, 2021.  The Plaintiffs contend that the 
vaccination  requirement  violates  their  First  Amendment  and  other  federal 
constitutional and statutory rights because it does not exempt from its requirements 
individuals  whose  sincerely  held  religious  beliefs  cause  them  to  object  to  being 

 1  The  Rule  can  be  found  at  https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/rules/maine-cdc-rules.shtml 
(perma.cc/R3UM-ZBN3) (navigate to the text of the Rule by selecting “Emergency,” and then choosing 
“Emergency  Rulemaking:  10-144  CMR  Ch.  264  –  Immunization  Requirements  for  Healthcare 
vaccinated against COVID-19.  Seven of the nine plaintiffs also contend that their 
employers violated federal employment law by refusing to grant them a religious 
exemption from the vaccination requirement.                               

    The Plaintiffs’ five-count Complaint (ECF No. 1) names as defendants, in their 
official capacities, Governor Mills; Dr. Nirav D. Shah, the Director of Maine CDC; 
and Jeanne M. Lambrew, the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and 
Human Services (“DHHS”) (the “State Defendants”).  The Complaint also names five 
incorporated entities that operate healthcare facilities in Maine: Defendants Genesis 
Healthcare  of  Maine,  LLC;  Genesis  Healthcare,  LLC;  Northern  Light  Health 

Foundation; MaineHealth; and MaineGeneral Health (the “Hospital Defendants”).     
    The Rule requires all employees of designated healthcare facilities2 to receive 
their final dose of the vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by September 
17, 2021.  10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 5(A)(7) (effective Aug. 12, 2021).  On September 
2, 2021, the DHHS and Maine CDC announced that they would not begin enforcing 
the Rule’s provisions until October 29, 2021, to allow additional time for employees 
of designated healthcare facilities to comply with the Rule by receiving their final 

vaccine dose by October 15.  ECF No. 49-5 at ¶ 37.  If granted, the preliminary 



 2  Under the Rule, designated healthcare facility “means a licensed nursing facility, residential care 
facility, Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID), multi-level 
healthcare facility, hospital, or home health agency subject to licensure by the State of Maine, 
Department of Health and Human Services Division of Licensing and Certification.”  The Rule also 
applies to dental health practices (where dentists and/or dental hygienists provide oral health care) 
and to Emergency Medical Services operations.  10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 1(D), (E), (H) (Aug. 12, 
2021).  All references to “designated healthcare facilities” in this Order include all of the entities 
subject to the Rule’s requirements.                                       
injunction would prohibit the Defendants from enforcing the Rule or terminating the 
Plaintiffs’ employment based on their refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19.   
    A hearing on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction was held on September 20, 

2021.3    After  careful  consideration  and  for  the  reasons  that  follow,  I  deny  the 
Plaintiffs’ motion.  (ECF No 3).                                          
                       II.  BACKGROUND                                   
    The parties have filed declarations and various exhibits in support of their 
positions.    Except  where  otherwise  noted,  I  have  based  my  findings  on  these 
documents.4  Additionally, I take judicial notice of certain additional facts pertinent 

to the Motion.  See In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 
2003) (noting that although a district court is generally limited to examining the 
record, it may also consider “the documents incorporated by reference in it, matters 
of public record, and other matters susceptible to judicial notice”);  see also Loucka v. 
Lincoln Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 334 F. Supp. 3d 1, 8-9 (D.D.C. 2018) (“[T]he CDC’s Lyme-
testing  criteria  and  procedures  are  a  matter  of  public  record,  and  it  cannot  be 
reasonably questioned that the agency’s website is an accurate source for those 

standards.”).                                                             


 3 The Plaintiffs’ Motion also included a request for an ex parte temporary restraining order to the 
same effect.  On August 26, 2021, after a conference with the Plaintiffs’ counsel, I denied that portion 
of the Motion (ECF No. 11), concluding that the Plaintiffs had not satisfied the requirements of Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(1) for a temporary restraining order without providing notice to the 
Defendants.                                                               

 4  The bulk of my findings regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the State’s response are derived 
from the Declaration of Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Director of Maine CDC, (ECF No. 49-4) and the Declaration 
of Sara Gagné-Holmes, Deputy Commissioner of the DHHS (ECF No. 49-5).  The Plaintiffs have not 
submitted declarations that dispute the factual assertions made in the Shah and Gagné-Holmes 
    To  provide the necessary background, I begin by addressing: (A) COVID-19 
and Maine’s response; (B) the asserted religious beliefs that cause Plaintiffs to refuse 
to be vaccinated against COVID-19; and (C) the origin of the emergency rulemaking 

that required that healthcare workers be vaccinated against COVID-19.     
A.   The COVID-19 Global Pandemic                                         
    COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious illness and 
death.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶¶ 11, 13, 15.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization 
declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 12.  As of September 
12, 2021, there were approximately 219 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide.  ECF 
No. 49-4 at ¶ 13.  Globally, over 4,550,000 people have died from COVID-19, including 

approximately 660,000 deaths in the United States.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 13.  As of 
September 14, 2021, Maine had 81,177 total cases of COVID-19, with 969 deaths.  
ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 14.                                                     
    Variants of the virus have emerged over the course of the pandemic.  ECF No. 
49-4 at ¶ 20.  The Delta variant, which is now the predominant variant of all COVID-
19 cases in the United States, ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 50, is more than twice as contagious 

as previous variants, ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 22.  As of August 27, 2021, the Delta variant 
accounted for 96.7% of all positive COVID-19 samples sequenced in Maine.  ECF No. 
49-4 at ¶ 50.  A higher level of contagiousness necessitates a correspondingly higher 
vaccination rate among the public to achieve “herd immunity.”5  ECF No. 49-4 at 


 5 Herd immunity refers to the population-level phenomenon whereby the community is sufficiently 
populated  with  vaccinated  individuals  that  unvaccinated  individuals  can  enjoy  a  substantially 
lessened risk of exposure and, therefore, of infection, as the vaccinated individuals block the virus from 
¶ 28.    With  the  emergence  of  the  Delta  variant,  epidemiological  models  have 
increased the projected vaccination rate needed to achieve herd immunity from 70% 
to 90%.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 29.                                            

    Three  COVID-19  vaccines  are  generally  available:  Pfizer-BioNTech  (the 
“Pfizer vaccine”), Moderna, and Janssen (the “J&J vaccine”).  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 40.  
All three are effective against the Delta variant.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 43.  Prior to their 
availability, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) 
and Maine CDC recommended that people wear face coverings and practice physical 
distancing to limit the spread of the virus.  ECF No. 49-5 at ¶ 5.  Once the first vaccine 

doses became available in December 2020, Maine CDC prioritized the vaccination of 
frontline  healthcare  professionals  and  patient-facing  staff  through  its  eligibility 
guidelines.  ECF No. 49-5 at ¶¶ 15-18.  The vaccines are now widely available, and 
the State has worked in parallel with hospital systems to encourage and facilitate the 
widespread vaccination of Maine residents.  ECF No. 49-5 at ¶¶ 19(f), 23-29.      
    The Rule was amended in August 2021 to add COVID-19 to the list of infectious 
diseases for which vaccinations are mandated for employees of designated healthcare 

facilities.  It represented the latest in a series of measures employed by the State to 
combat  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  healthcare  settings.    When  formulating  the 
amendment,  Maine  CDC  reviewed  and  considered  alternatives  to  mandating 
vaccinations, including  the  measures  then  being  employed  by  Maine  healthcare 
facilities, such as twice-weekly or daily testing, symptom monitoring, and the use of 
personal protective equipment (“PPE”).  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶¶ 59-64.  Maine CDC 

rejected twice-weekly testing as inadequate given the speed at which the Delta 
variant is transmitted—a person infected with the Delta variant can transmit the 
infection to others within just 24 to 36 hours of exposure.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶¶ 25, 61.  
Similarly, Maine CDC rejected daily antigen testing as insufficient because the most 

effective tests (polymerase-chain-reaction tests (“PCR”)) require 24 to 72 hours to 
produce results and the faster rapid-antigen tests are too inaccurate and in short 
supply.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 62.  Symptom monitoring as a standalone measure was 
rejected because the virus can be transmitted by persons who are asymptomatic.  ECF 
No. 49-4 at ¶ 60.  Similarly, sole reliance on the use of PPE was rejected because, 
even if worn correctly, PPE will not stop the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare 

settings.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 64.                                          
    Healthcare  facilities  throughout  Maine  have  used  a  combination  of  the 
preceding  measures  to  control  the  COVID-19  virus  since  the  beginning  of  the 
pandemic; nonetheless, they have been the sites of numerous outbreaks of the virus.  
ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 65.  The number of outbreaks at designated healthcare facilities 
rose substantially from early August to early September 2021, notwithstanding the 
fact that the hospitals where the outbreaks occurred had strong infection control 

programs in place.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶¶ 46-47.  Most of the healthcare facility 
outbreaks resulted from infected healthcare workers bringing COVID-19 into the 
facility.   ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 48.                                         
B.   The Plaintiffs’ Objection to the COVID-19 Vaccines                   
    The Plaintiffs are nine individuals who are identified in the Complaint by 
pseudonyms.  The Complaint alleges that Jane Does 1 through 5 and John Does 2 
and 3 are healthcare workers employed by the Hospital Defendants.  John Doe 1 is a 
licensed  healthcare  provider  who  operates  his  own  practice.  Jane  Doe  6  is  a 
healthcare worker employed by John Doe 1.6, 7                             
    The Plaintiffs object to receiving the COVID-19 vaccines based on their stated 

belief that “life is sacred from the moment of conception[.]”  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 54.   They 
contend that the development of the three COVID-19 vaccines employed or benefitted 
from the cell lines of aborted fetuses.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs object to the Moderna 
and Pfizer vaccines because both are mRNA vaccines which, the Plaintiffs claim, 
“have their origins in research on aborted fetal cells lines.”  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 65.  


 6 The Complaint alleges the following facts regarding the Plaintiffs:   

    Plaintiff Jane Doe 1 is a Maine resident and healthcare worker employed by a healthcare 
facility operated by Defendant MaineHealth in Maine.  She submitted a written request for a religious 
exemption from the vaccine mandate to her employer, which was denied.     

    Plaintiff John Doe 1 is a licensed healthcare provider who operates a designated healthcare 
facility in Maine.  The Complaint alleges that he and his employees have sincerely held religious 
objections to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and that he faces the closure of his practice and loss of 
his business license should he consider or grant religious exemptions to the vaccine mandate to his 
employees.                                                                

    Plaintiff Jane Doe 6 is a healthcare worker employed by John Doe 1.  The Complaint is unclear 
as to whether she has requested a religious exemption to the mandate from her employer, John Doe 
1.                                                                        

    Plaintiffs Jane Doe 2 and John Doe 2 are both Maine residents and healthcare workers 
employed  by  healthcare  facilities  operated  by  Defendant  Genesis  Healthcare  in  Maine.    Both 
submitted  written  requests  for  religious  exemptions  from  the  vaccine  mandate,  and  Genesis 
Healthcare denied them.  Jane Doe 2 was given until August 23, 2021 to receive the vaccination and 
alleges that she was terminated from her employment for failure to meet this deadline.   

    Plaintiffs Jane Does 3 and 4 and John Doe 3 are Maine residents and healthcare workers 
employed by healthcare facilities operated by Defendant Northern Light Health Foundation in Maine.  
Each submitted written requests for religious exemptions from the vaccine mandate, and each request 
was denied.                                                               

    Plaintiff Jane Doe 5 is a Maine resident and healthcare worker employed by a healthcare 
facility operated by Defendant MaineGeneral Health in Maine.  She submitted a written request for a 
religious exemption from the vaccine mandate to her employer, which was denied. 

 7 The Complaint also names Plaintiffs Jack Does 1 through 1000 and Joan Does 1 through 1000 as 
Plaintiffs also object to the J&J vaccine, asserting that aborted fetal cell lines were 
used in both its development and production.  They allege that the use of fetal cell 
lines to develop the vaccines runs counter to their sincerely held religious beliefs that 

cause them to oppose abortion.                                            
    In their responses to the Plaintiffs’ motion seeking preliminary injunctive 
relief, the Defendants have not challenged the sincerity of the Plaintiffs’ asserted 
religious beliefs or that those beliefs are the reason for the Plaintiffs’ refusal to be 
vaccinated.  I therefore treat these facts as established for purposes of deciding the 
Preliminary Injunction Motion.8                                           

C.   The COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate                                         
    Mandatory vaccination requirements for healthcare workers in Maine were 
established long before the emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019.  Since 1989, Maine 
has required by statute that hospitals and other healthcare facilities ensure that their 
employees are vaccinated against certain communicable diseases.  1989 Me. Legis. 
Serv. 641 (West).  When the statute, 22 M.R.S.A. § 802 (1989), was first enacted, it 
required vaccinations for measles and rubella.  Its stated purpose was to report, 

prevent, and control infectious diseases that pose a potential public health threat to 
the people of Maine.  Id. § 802(1)(D) (1989).                             
    The ensuing years witnessed the development of new vaccines and vaccine 
recommendations, resulting in frequent revisions to the statute.  In response, the 


 8 Pursuant to the Court’s scheduling order entered on September 2, 2021 (ECF No. 35), the deadline 
for the Defendants’ answers to the Complaint will be set once the Court has entered an order on the 
Motion for Preliminary Injunction and the period for filing an interlocutory appeal of that order has 
expired or, if an interlocutory appeal is filed, the appeal has been finally determined.  As a result, the 
statute  was  again  amended  in  2001  to  delegate  to  DHHS  the  authority,  by 
rulemaking, to designate mandatory vaccines for healthcare workers at designated 
healthcare facilities and for school children.  2001 Me. Legis. Serv. 147 (West).  

Accordingly,  in  2002  DHHS  promulgated  and  first  adopted  the  rule  entitled 
“Immunization Requirements for Healthcare Workers,” which is the Rule at issue 
here.  10-144-264 Me. Code R. §§ 1-7 (Apr. 16, 2002).  At its adoption, the Rule 
required vaccinations for measles, rubella, hepatitis B, mumps, and chickenpox.  Id. 
at § 5(A).                                                                
    From  2001  until  2019,  the  statute  contained  three  exemptions  from  the 

vaccination requirements for both Maine healthcare workers and school children: a 
“medical exemption” for those who provided “a physician’s written statement that 
immunization against one or more diseases may be medically inadvisable,” and both 
“religious  [and]  philosophical  exemption[s]”  for  those  “who  state[d]  in  writing  a 
sincere  religious  or  philosophical  belief  that  is  contrary  to  the  immunization 
requirement.”  22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B)(A), (B) (2019).  In 2019, the Maine Legislature 
enacted legislation repealing the exemptions for religious and philosophical beliefs, 

2019 Me. Legis. Serv. 386 (West), thus leaving the medical exemption as the sole 
exemption permitted under law.  In response to this legislative change, a statewide 
veto referendum regarding the new law eliminating the religious and philosophical 
exemptions was held in March 2020 pursuant to the People’s Veto provision of the 
Maine Constitution, Me. Const. art. IV, pt. III, § 17.  The law was upheld, with over 
72% of voters voting in favor of it.9  In April 2021, DHHS amended the Rule by, among 
other things, removing the provision describing the permissible exemptions and 
referring back to the statute which lists medical exemptions as the sole category of 

exemption.  See 10-144-264 Me. Code R. § 3 (effective Apr. 14, 2021); 22 M.R.S.A. § 
802(4-B)(B).10   In August 2021, DHHS promulgated the current version of the Rule 
by adding the COVID-19 vaccination to the list of required vaccinations and also 
adding  dental  practices  and  emergency  services  organizations  as  enumerated 
designated healthcare facilities subject to the Rule’s requirements.  10-144 C.M.R. 
Me. Code R. § 1 (effective Aug. 12, 2021).  The Plaintiffs do not challenge the 

lawfulness of the rulemaking process by which the current version of the Rule was 
adopted.                                                                  
    The preceding history demonstrates that although Plaintiffs’ arguments are 
directed at the amendment of the Rule in August 2021 and the Rule’s failure to 
include a religious exemption from the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, it was the 
Legislature’s revision of the statute in 2019 which eliminated the religious exemption 
for all mandatory vaccines.  Therefore, when I refer in this decision to the COVID-19 

vaccine mandate, I am referring to the Rule as it operates in conjunction with the 
statute, 22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B), which authorizes it.

    Having provided the necessary background, I turn to the legal standard which 
would govern the award of a preliminary injunction.                       
        III.  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION LEGAL STANDARD                      

    “A preliminary injunction is an ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy . . . that is 
never awarded as of right.’”  Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV Med. News Now, 
Inc., 645 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689-90 
(2008)).                                                                  
    A  trial  court  must  consider  four  factors  when  assessing  a  request  for  a 
preliminary injunction: (1) likelihood of success on the merits, (2) whether, absent 

preliminary relief, the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm, (3) whether “the balance 
of equities tips in [the plaintiff’s] favor,” and (4) whether granting the injunction 
serves the public interest.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Of 
these factors, “[t]he movant’s likelihood of success on the merits weighs most heavily 
in the preliminary injunction calculus.”  Ryan v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 974 
F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 2020).  This first factor is so consequential that “[i]f the moving 
party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the remaining 

factors become matters of idle curiosity.”  Me. Educ. Ass’n Benefits Tr. v. Cioppa, 695 
F.3d 145, 152 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, 
Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002)).                                     
    At this preliminary stage, the court “need not conclusively determine the 
merits of the movant’s claim; it is enough for the court simply to evaluate the 
likelihood . . . that the movant ultimately will prevail on the merits.”  Ryan, 974 F.3d 

at 18.                                                                    
                       IV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS                               
    The Plaintiffs’ Complaint presents five claims arising under: (A) the Free 
Exercise Clause of the First Amendment; (B) Title VII, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e to e-17 

(West 2021); (C) the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (D) a 
claim of Conspiracy in violation of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985 (West 2021); and (E) the 
Supremacy Clause.  As will become apparent, the likelihood of the Plaintiffs’ success 
on their Free Exercise claim largely controls the outcome as to the remaining claims 
for purposes of determining the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to preliminary injunctive 
relief.                                                                   
A.    The Free Exercise of Religion                                       
    The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which applies to the states 

through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that “Congress shall make no law 
prohibiting the free exercise” of religion.  U.S. Const. amend. I, see Cantwell v. 
Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303-04 (1940) (incorporating the Free Exercise Clause of 
the First Amendment against the states).  The clause “embraces two concepts[:] 
freedom to believe and freedom to act.”  Cantwell, 310 U.S. at 303.  Although the 
freedom to believe is absolute, the freedom to act on one’s religious beliefs “remains 

subject to regulation for the protection of society.”  Id. at 304.       
    The Constitution’s Free Exercise Clause does not prevent states from enacting 
a “neutral, generally applicable regulatory law,” even when that law infringes on 
religious practices.  See Emp. Div., Dep’t of Hum. Res. of Or. V. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 
879-882 (1990).  Laws that are deemed both neutral and generally applicable are 
traditionally subject to rational basis review.  Thus, in Smith, the U.S. Supreme 
Court explained: “We have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs excuse 
him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State 
is free to regulate.  On the contrary, the record of more than a century of our free 

exercise jurisprudence contradicts that proposition.”  Id. at 878-79.  Further, “if 
prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is not the object of the [state action] but 
merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, 
the First Amendment has not been offended.”11  Id. at 878.  However, if a law 
burdens a religious practice and does not satisfy the requirements of neutrality and 
general applicability, the law is invalid under the Free Exercise Clause unless it 

survives  strict  scrutiny,  meaning it  is “justified  by a  compelling governmental 
interest and . . . narrowly tailored to advance that interest.”  Church of the Lukumi 
Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 531-32 (1993).        
    The parties’ dispute under the Free Exercise Clause centers on the standard of 
constitutional review that applies: rational basis review or strict scrutiny review.  The 
Plaintiffs argue that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate’s failure to provide a religious 
exemption means that the regulation is not neutral and generally applicable and, 


 11  Writing for the Court’s majority in Smith, Justice Scalia reasoned that the question of whether a 
religious exemption or accommodation should be adopted as part of a neutral, generally applicable 
regulatory law is not within the purview of the courts’ role in enforcing the Free Exercise Clause but 
is instead for the other branches of government to determine:             

    But to say that a nondiscriminatory religious-practice exemption is permitted [by the 
    Free Exercise Clause], or even that it is desirable, is not to say that it is constitutionally 
    required, and that the appropriate occasions for its creation can be discerned by the 
    courts.  It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the political process will 
    place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged 
    in; but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to 
    a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh the 
    social importance of all laws against the centrality of all religious beliefs. 
therefore, must be analyzed under the more demanding strict scrutiny standard.  The 
Defendants  disagree,  contending  that  the  mandate  is  neutral  and  generally 
applicable  notwithstanding  the  lack  of  religious  exemption,  and  that  the  more 

deferential rational basis standard of review applies.                    
    Under rational basis review, “a neutral, generally applicable regulatory law 
that  compel[s]  activity  forbidden  by  an  individual’s  religion”  withstands  a  Free 
Exercise challenge if there is a rational basis for the regulation.  Smith, 494 U.S. at 
880.  Applying rational basis review to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate at issue here 
would be in keeping with the Supreme Court’s foundational decision in the area of 

mandatory vaccines—Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905)—in which the 
Court upheld the constitutionality of a state mandated smallpox vaccine.  In so doing, 
the  Court  applied  a  deferential  standard  of  review  and  rejected  a  Fourteenth 
Amendment  substantive  due  process  challenge  to  the  law,  concluding  that  the 
mandatory vaccination law was constitutional because it had a “real [and] substantial 
relation to the protection of the public health and the public safety.”12  Id. at 31.  


 12 The Plaintiffs argue that because Jacobson pre-dates both the application of the Free Exercise 
Clause to the states and the Court’s adoption of the tiers of scrutiny for constitutional questions, it is 
inapposite.  The Defendants do not solely rest their argument on Jacobson but they do argue that it 
supports the more general proposition that a state may mandate vaccinations and need not include 
religious exemptions when doing so.                                       

      In the years since the Supreme Court recognized that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause 
applies to the states, Jacobson has been treated as informative authority both regarding the scope of 
government power to enact mandatory vaccination requirements to protect public health and for the 
proposition  that  the  Constitution  does  not  require  religious  exemptions  from  state-mandated 
vaccinations.  See, e.g., Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174, 176 (1922) (affirming that Jacobson “settled that 
it is within the police power of a state to provide for compulsory vaccination”); Prince v. Massachusetts, 
321 U.S. 158, 166-67 (1944) (“The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the 
community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death.”); Phillips v. City 
of New York, 775 F.3d 538, 543 (2d Cir. 2015) (“[M]andatory vaccination as a condition for admission 
to school does not violate the Free Exercise Clause”); Nikolao v. Lyon, 875 F.3d 310, 316 (6th Cir. 2017) 
(“[Plaintiff] has not been denied any legal right on the basis of her religion.  Constitutionally, [plaintiff] 
However,  Jacobson  did  not  specifically  address  the  scope  of  an  individual’s 
constitutional rights under the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause in relation 
to mandatory vaccines, and that inquiry is the crux of the dispute here.   

    Under strict scrutiny review, a challenged government action may be upheld 
only if “it is justified by a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that 
interest.”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533.  “[N]arrow tailoring requires the government to 
show  that  measures  less  restrictive  of  the  First  Amendment  activity  could  not 
address its interest in reducing the spread of COVID.”  Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 
1294, 1296-97 (2021) (per curiam).  The government must also demonstrate that it 

“seriously undertook to address the problem with less intrusive tools readily available 
to it” and “that it considered different methods that other jurisdictions have found 
effective.”  McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.S. 464, 494 (2014).               



has no right to a [vaccine] exemption.”); Workman v. Mingo Cnty. Bd. Of Educ., 419 Fed. App’x 348, 
352-54 (4th Cir. 2011) (relying on the Jacobson, Zucht, and Prince line of cases to hold that a state 
mandatory vaccination law that allowed medical but not religious exemptions was constitutional); 
Whitlow v. California, 203 F. Supp. 3d 1079, 1084, 1086 (S.D. Cal. 2016) (“[I]t is clear that the 
Constitution does not require the provision of a religious exemption to vaccination requirements” 
because, “[a]s stated in Prince, the right to free exercise does not outweigh the State’s interest in public 
health and safety.”); Klaassen v. Trs. Of Ind. Univ., No. 1:21-CV-238, 2021 WL 3073926, at *17-22, *39 
(N.D. Ind. July 18, 2021) (providing a detailed analysis of Jacobson’s continued viability and noting 
that “courts have consistently held that schools that provided a religious exemption from mandatory 
vaccination requirements did so above and beyond that mandated by the Constitution”), aff’d, 7 F.4th 
592 (7th Cir. 2021) (relying on Jacobson to hold that “there can’t be a constitutional problem with 
vaccination against SARS-CoV-2” because, although Jacobson has been criticized, “a court of appeals 
must apply the law established by the Supreme Court”);  Boone v. Boozman, 217 F. Supp. 2d 938, 954 
(E.D. Ark. 2002) (“The constitutionally-protected free exercise of religion does not excuse an individual 
from compulsory immunization; in this instance, the right to free exercise of religion . . . [is] 
subordinated to society’s interest in protecting against the spread of disease.”); Harris v. Univ. of 
Mass., Lowell, No. 21-cv-11244, 2021 WL 3848012, at *7 (D. Mass. Aug. 27, 2021) (following the 
Jacobson line to hold that “UMass is under no constitutional obligation to offer a religious exemption 
to its Vaccine Requirement.”).                                            
    To determine whether rational basis or strict scrutiny review applies, I turn to 
consider  whether  the  COVID-19  vaccine  mandate  is  both  (1)  neutral,  and  (2) 
generally applicable.                                                     

    1.   Neutrality                                                      
    Neutrality examines whether the State’s object, or purpose, was to “infringe 
upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation.”   Lukumi, 508 U.S. 
at 533.  A law is not neutral if its object “is to infringe upon or restrict practices 
because of their religious motivation.”  Id.  The first step in determining the object of 
a law is to examine whether it is facially neutral.  Id. (“[T]he minimum requirement 

of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face.”).              
    By this standard, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate challenged here is facially 
neutral.  Neither the applicable statute nor the Rule mention religion, even by 
implication.  Operating in tandem, they require that all healthcare workers employed 
at designated healthcare facilities receive the COVID-19 vaccination.  They do not 
treat the COVID-19 vaccine differently than any other vaccinations mandated under 
Maine law.                                                                

    The vaccine mandate’s facial neutrality is not dispositive, though, because the 
“[g]overnment [also] fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of 
religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature.”  Fulton v. 
City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868, 1877 (2021).  Thus, even a facially neutral law 
may not be neutral for Free Exercise purposes if its object is to discriminate against 
religious beliefs, practices, or motivations.  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534 (“The Free 
Exercise Clause protects against governmental hostility, which is masked, as well as 
overt.”).                                                                 
     The Plaintiffs contend that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is not neutral 

because the removal of the religious exemption from the Rule “specifically target[ed] 
Plaintiffs’ religious beliefs for disparate and discriminatory treatment.”   ECF No. 1 
¶ 131.  They assert that “Maine has plainly singled out religious employees who 
decline vaccination for especially harsh treatment (i.e., depriving them from earning 
a living anywhere in the State), while favoring employees declining vaccination for 
secular, medical reasons.”  ECF No. 57 at 4.  This argument mirrors claims made 

recently by healthcare providers challenging New York’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, 
which also did not provide for religious exemptions.  Dr. A. v. Hochul, No. 1:21-cv-
1009,  at  **4-6  (N.D.N.Y.  Oct.  12,  2021).    However,  the  challenged  New  York 
regulation is distinguishable from Maine’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, because the 
New York regulation originally provided for a religious exemption which was then 
removed only a few days before the requirement became effective; additionally, New 
York provides religious exemptions to other mandated vaccinations for healthcare 

workers.  Id. at *4, *5, *16 n.9.  For these reasons, the court determined that the 
intentional, last-minute change to the language in the New York regulation was a 
“religious gerrymander” that required strict scrutiny.  Id. at *19.  In contrast, the 
Maine Legislature removed the religious exemption as to all mandated vaccines by 
amending 22 M.R.S.A. § 802(4-B) in 2019.  Following the unsuccessful People’s Veto 
held in 2020, DHHS removed the religious exemption from the Rule in April 2021 to 

conform the Rule to the 2019 statutory change.  This revision pre-dated the COVID-
19 vaccine requirement and served to ensure that the Rule was consistent with Maine 
law.  The history associated with the revision of the Rule does not demonstrate 
animus toward religion.                                                   

    In support of their argument, the Plaintiffs cite to a trio of recent per curiam 
or memorandum decisions issued by the U.S. Supreme Court:  Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 62 (2020) (per curiam); South Bay Pentecostal 
Church v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 716 (2021) (mem.); and Tandon v. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 
1294 (2021) (per curiam).  Each involved a challenge to a state law aimed at quelling 
the spread of COVID-19.  Each was issued in response to a motion for emergency 

injunctive relief to preserve the status quo pending resolution of appellate review.  Of 
the three, the Plaintiffs rest primarily on Tandon v. Newsom.             
    In Tandon, the Supreme Court granted injunctive relief against enforcement 
of a California regulation that prohibited indoor private gatherings of more than 
three  households  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.    141  S.  Ct.  at  1297.    The 
prohibition had the effect of restricting at-home religious gatherings while allowing 
groups of more than three households to gather in public settings, such as hair salons, 

retail stores, and restaurants.  Id.  In enjoining the regulation’s enforcement, the 
Court  explained  that  “government  regulations  are  not  neutral  and  generally 
applicable, and therefore trigger strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause, 
whenever they treat any comparable secular activity more favorably than religious 
exercise.”  Id. at 1296.  “[W]hether two activities are comparable for purposes of the 
Free Exercise Clause must be judged against the asserted government interest that 

justifies the regulation at issue.”  Id.  “Comparability is concerned with the risks 
various activities pose, not the reasons” motivating the activities.  Id.  The Court’s 
majority concluded that private indoor gatherings of three or more households were 
comparable to groups of the same or a greater number of households in public 

businesses, which were not prohibited by the regulation, and granted an injunction 
against the policy’s enforcement pending appellate review.  Id. at 1297.  
    Citing Tandon, the Plaintiffs argue that the Free Exercise Clause prohibits the 
treatment of “any secular activity more favorably than religious activity.”  ECF No. 
57 at 3 (emphasis in original).  This misstates Tandon’s holding because it omits the 
crucial modifier—“comparable”—from the analysis of whether a secular activity has 

been treated more favorably than a religious activity.                    
    In the unique context of a vaccine mandate intended to protect public health, 
there is a fundamental difference between a medical exemption—which is integral to 
achieving the public health aims of the mandate—and exemptions based on religious 
or philosophical objections—which are unrelated to the mandate’s public health 
goals.  The risks associated with the two are not comparable.  Reducing the risk of 
adverse medical consequences for a high-risk segment of the population is essential 

to achieving the public health objective of the vaccine mandate.  A religious exemption 
would not address a risk associated with the vaccine mandate’s central objectives.  
Under Tandon’s reasoning, rational basis review applies.                  
    Tandon is distinguishable from this case in another respect.  The vaccination 
requirement challenged here does not prevent the Plaintiffs from exercising their 
religious beliefs by refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccination.  In contrast, in 

Tandon interference with the free exercise of religion was direct because the statute 
prevented like-minded persons from gathering together to perform religious rituals.  
Here, the Rule does not compel the Plaintiffs to be vaccinated against their will, and 
the Plaintiffs have, in fact, freely exercised their religious beliefs by declining to be 

vaccinated.  This is not to minimize the seriousness of the indirect consequences of 
the Plaintiffs’ refusal to be vaccinated, as it affects their employment.  Nonetheless, 
the Rule has not prevented the Plaintiffs from staying true to their professed religious 
beliefs.                                                                  
    The two remaining decisions in the trio relied upon by the Plaintiffs are also 
readily distinguished.  In South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom,13 the 

Court partially granted an application for injunctive relief from California Governor 
Gavin Newsom’s executive order limiting attendance at indoor religious gatherings 
to prevent further spread of COVID-19.  141 S. Ct. at 716, 718.  Writing separately, 
Justice Gorsuch concluded that the restrictions on religious institutions imposed by 
California  followed  a  pattern  of  that  state  “openly  impos[ing]  more  stringent 
regulations  on  religious  institutions  than  on  many  businesses”  throughout  the 
pandemic, and that this represented religious discrimination and required strict 

scrutiny.  Id. at 717 (statement of Gorsuch, J.).  The restrictions considered in South 
Bay are unlike the vaccine mandate at issue here.  Id.  In South Bay, California had 
explicitly imposed stricter attendance limits on in-person worship services, while not 


 13 The California Order challenged in South Bay came before the Court twice on application for 
injunctive relief:  in May 2020, the Court issued a memorandum opinion denying the application, 140 
S. Ct. 1613, 1613 (2020) (Mem.); in February 2021 the Court denied relief with respect to the 
percentage capacity limitations imposed on houses of worship and limitations on singing and chanting 
during indoor services, and granted the injunction with respect to the other capacity limits, 141 S. Ct. 
imposing similar limits in secular settings.  There is no similar targeted imposition 
of restrictions on religious practices presented by the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.  
    Finally, in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, the Supreme Court 

granted  injunctive  relief  from  a  State  of  New  York  order  that  imposed  severe 
restrictions on religious gatherings in certain high-risk zones of New York City 
during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.  141 S. Ct. at 66.  Specifically, the 
order limited attendance at religious gatherings in “red” zones to no more than ten 
persons and in “orange” zones to no more than 25 persons, while allowing myriad 
essential  businesses  in  those  same  locations  to  admit  an  unlimited  number  of 

persons.  Id. at 66-67.  Invoking Smith, the Court determined that the challenged 
order was neither neutral nor generally applicable due to these categorizations.  Id. 
at 67.  Applying strict scrutiny, the Court held that although “[s]temming the spread 
of COVID-19 is unquestionably a compelling interest,” the regulation was likely 
unconstitutional for lack of narrow tailoring.  Id.  There were multiple less restrictive 
rules that could have achieved the State’s goal without burdening the exercise of 
religion so severely, such as tying the maximum attendance at a house of worship to 

the size of that facility.  Id.  The Court was not persuaded that the State demonstrated 
that houses of worship, which had “admirable safety records,” “contributed to the 
spread of COVID-19” such that the targeted and restrictive prohibition could be 
constitutionally sound.  Id. at 67-68.                                    
    Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn is distinguishable from the COVID-19 
vaccine mandate at issue here because the mandate does not impose restrictions on 

religious practices while allowing similar secular conduct to continue unfettered.  
Additionally, the vaccine mandate does not compel the Plaintiffs to be vaccinated for 
COVID-19  involuntarily  and,  therefore,  the  Plaintiffs  have  not  been  directly 
prevented from adhering to their religious beliefs as was the case in Roman Catholic 

Diocese of Brooklyn.  Finally, as I will soon address, the State Defendants have 
demonstrated that other less-restrictive measures would be insufficient alternatives 
to the vaccine mandate.                                                   
    Therefore, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is facially neutral, and the trio of 
recent Supreme Court per curiam and memorandum COVID-19 decisions does not 
dictate otherwise.  Additionally, in probing for covert animus, what matters is the 

State’s motive in removing the vaccine exceptions for religion and philosophy from 
the statute in 2019 because it was then—not in 2021 as Plaintiffs assert—that the 
change took effect.  The Plaintiffs have not offered any reasoned explanation as to 
why Maine’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers should be viewed as 
targeting religious beliefs while vaccines for other communicable diseases that may 
have involved fetal cell lines in their development or production should not.  The 
record establishes that the Maine Legislature’s object in eliminating the religious and 

philosophical exemptions in 2019 was to further crucial public health goals, and 
nothing more.                                                             
    Specifically,  the  Legislature  considered  data  establishing  that  it  was  the 
religious and philosophical exemptions to mandatory vaccines that had prevented 
Maine from achieving herd immunity as to several infectious diseases, which is a 
prerequisite to eliminating those diseases.14  Measles, for example, requires a 95% 
population-level vaccination rate, ECF No. 49-4 ¶ 35, and this was undermined in the 
years prior to 2019 by the large percentage of unvaccinated persons resulting from 

the religious and philosophical exemptions, ECF No. 48-3 at 3-6.  As Representative 
McDonald, cosponsor of the legislation, testified:                        
    Maine  has  the  seventh-highest  non-medical  exemption  rate  in  the 
    nation. . . .  The average philosophical and religious exemption rate for 
    kindergarten-aged  students  in  Hancock  County,  ME  was  8.7      
    percent. . . .  There are schools [in Hancock County] experiencing non-
    medical exemption rates as high as 33.3 percent.                     

ECF No. 48-3 at 1.                                                        

    Then-Acting Director of Maine CDC, Nancy Beardsley, testified that “non-
medical exemptions, which include religious and philosophical reasons, were reported 
at 5.0% for Maine, compared to the national rate of 2.0%.”  ECF No. 48-4 at 1.  Medical 
exemptions, in contrast, accounted for 0.3% of the overall exemption rate.  ECF No. 
48-4 at 1.  Beardsley also testified that the high exemption rates in Maine had caused 
pertussis outbreaks:                                                      
    Hancock and Waldo counties also represent two of the four counties with 
    the highest reported rates of pertussis cases in 2018 . . . .  Not only did 
    high exemption rates likely contribute to high rates of pertussis disease 
    in these two counties, but also in the entire State, as Maine reported the 
    highest rate of pertussis disease in the country for 2018.           

ECF No. 48-4 at 2.                                                        

 14 The statistics referenced in the legislative record, and cited here, pertain to vaccination rates for 
school children; however, they are relevant to the State’s motivations for healthcare workers because 
the statute at issue removed religious and philosophical exemptions for both of these groups and there 
is no colorable argument (nor have the Plaintiffs advanced one) that the State had a different 
    The Plaintiffs have not specifically disputed that the reasons put forward by 
the State Defendants for the Legislature’s removal of the religious and philosophical 
exemptions in 2019 were, in fact, the actual reasons.  Accordingly, there is no factual 

support for the proposition that the August 2021 amendment of the Rule, adding the 
COVID-19  vaccine  to  the  list  of  mandatory  vaccinations  for  Maine’s  healthcare 
workers,  “specifically  target[ed]  Plaintiffs’  religious  beliefs  for  disparate  and 
discriminatory treatment,” as the Plaintiffs argue.  ECF No. 1 ¶ 131.  Moreover, there 
is no basis to find that the August 2021 amendment of the Rule, including the removal 
of the religious and philosophical exemptions so that the Rule would conform to the 

2019  amendment  to the  statute,  was intended  to  discriminate  against  religious 
beliefs, practices, or motivations.  See Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534.  For these reasons, 
the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is neutral because it is facially neutral and it was not 
intended  to  discriminate  against  individuals’  religious  beliefs,  practices,  or 
motivations.                                                              
     2.  General Applicability                                           
    General applicability addresses whether the State has selectively “impos[ed] 

burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief.”  Id. at 543. The Plaintiffs 
reason that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is not generally applicable and that it 
must be subjected to strict scrutiny review because the mandate favors healthcare 
workers who refuse to be vaccinated for medical reasons over healthcare workers who 
refuse to be vaccinated for religious reasons.  They contend that the State’s adoption 
of medical exemptions as the sole type of exemption reflects a value judgment by the 

State, one which prioritizes secular interests over religious interests.  Thus, they 
contend that the vaccine mandate fails the test of general applicability because it 
burdens religious beliefs while not similarly burdening secular interests. 
    Individualized exemptions undermine a regulation’s general applicability if 

they display an unconstitutional value judgment that gives preference to secular 
concerns over religious concerns.  In Fulton, the Supreme Court explained that “[a] 
law is not generally applicable if it invites the government to consider the particular 
reasons  for  a  person’s  conduct  by  providing  a  mechanism  for  individualized 
exemptions.”  Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1877; see also Cent. Rabbinical Cong. Of U.S. & 
Can. V. N.Y.C. Dep’t. of Health & Mental Hygiene, 763 F.3d 183, 197 (2d Cir. 2014) 

(citing Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 535-38).  (“A law is . . . not generally applicable if it is 
substantially underinclusive such that it regulates religious conduct while failing to 
regulate secular conduct that is at least as harmful to the legitimate government 
interests  purportedly  justifying  it.)”    “[W]hen  the  government  makes  a  value 
judgment  in  favor  of  secular  motivations,  but  not  religious  motivations,  the 
government’s actions must survive heightened scrutiny.”  Fraternal Ord. of Police, 
Newark Lodge No. 12 v. City of Newark, 170 F.3d 359, 366 (3d Cir. 1999).  

    The Plaintiffs contend that the medical exemption at issue here should be 
treated  as  an  individualized  exception  which  is  “sufficiently  suggestive  of 
discriminatory intent so as to trigger heightened [strict] scrutiny.”  Id.  They point to 
various judicial decisions applying strict scrutiny and invalidating regulations that 
permitted medical exemptions but not religious exemptions.  However, the decisions 
cited  by  the Plaintiffs  all  relate  to  government  regulations  that  were  primarily 

intended to achieve governmental objectives other than protecting public health.  
Thus,  in  Fraternal  Order  of  Police,  id,  the  court  applied  strict  scrutiny  and 
invalidated a regulation that prohibited beards for male police officers that was 
adopted for the stated purpose of promoting uniformity of the officers’ appearance, 

and which granted a medical exemption from the requirement while not exempting 
officers who maintained beards as a matter of religious faith.  The other decisions 
cited by the Plaintiffs addressed similar circumstances.  See Litzman v. New York 
City Police Department, No. 12 Civ. 4681, 2013 WL 6049066, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 
15, 2013) (requiring religious exemptions to a policy mandating once-yearly facial 
shaving  for  male  police  officers  to  ensure  compliance  with  respirator  fit-testing 

requirements);  Singh  v.  McHugh,  185  F.  Supp.  3d  201,  211-13  (D.D.C.  2015) 
(determining that religious accommodation was required under a policy that would 
not permit a Sikh student seeking to enroll in the Army’s Reserve Officers’ Training 
Corps program to wear a turban, unshorn hair, and beard due to a grooming policy 
to promote uniformity); and Cunningham v. City of Shreveport, 407 F. Supp. 3d 595, 
599 (W.D. La. 2019) (determining a policy requiring beards for male officers “for 
officer safety reasons and to promote a uniform appearance of all officers” required 

religious accommodations).                                                
    Here, the purpose of requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for healthcare workers 
is to protect public health and not any other policy objective, such as promoting the 
uniformity of the appearance of police officers or firefighters.  Exempting individuals 
whose health will be threatened if they receive a COVID-19 vaccine is an essential, 
constituent part of a reasoned public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  It 

does not suggest a discriminatory bias against religion.  See W.D. v. Rockland County, 
521 F. Supp. 3d 358, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (concluding that New York’s emergency 
declaration  mandating  vaccinations  against  measles,  which  provided  a  medical 
exemption but not a religious exemption, met the requirement of general applicability 

by “encouraging vaccination of all those for whom it was medically possible, while 
protecting those who could not be inoculated for medical reasons.”).      
    The medical exemption at issue here was adopted to protect persons whose 
health may be jeopardized by receiving a COVID-19 vaccination.  The exemption is 
rightly viewed as an essential facet of the vaccine’s core purpose of protecting the 
health of patients and healthcare workers, including those who, for bona fide medical 

reasons, cannot be safely vaccinated.  Because the medical exemption serves the core 
purpose of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, it does not reflect a value judgment 
prioritizing  a  purely  secular  interest—such  as  the  uniformity  of  appearance  of 
uniformed officers considered in Fraternal Order of Police—over religious interests.  
In  addition,  the  vaccine  mandate  places  an  equal burden  on  all  secular  beliefs 
unrelated to protecting public health—for example, philosophical or politically-based 
objections to state-mandated vaccination requirements—to the same extent that it 

burdens religious beliefs.                                                
    The medical exemption applicable to the COVID-19 vaccine and the other 
vaccines  required  under  Maine  law  does  not  reflect  a  value  judgment  unfairly 
favoring secular interests over religious interests.  As an integral part of the vaccine 
requirement itself, the medical exemption for healthcare workers does not undermine 
the vaccine mandate’s general applicability.                              
    3.   Conclusion Regarding the Standard of Constitutional Review      
    For the reasons I have explained, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is both 
neutral and generally applicable; therefore, rational basis review applies.  The trio of 

recent  Supreme  Court  per  curiam  and  memorandum  decisions relied  on  by the 
Plaintiffs do not suggest otherwise.  I therefore turn to consider whether the mandate 
satisfies rational basis review.                                          
    4.   Rational Basis Review                                           
    The Plaintiffs do not seriously question the existence of a rational basis for the 
adoption of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.  I address this question nonetheless 

because it is the key to deciding the requirement’s constitutionality under the Free 
Exercise Clause.  “A law survives rational basis review so long as the law is rationally 
related to a legitimate governmental interest.”  Cook v. Gates, 528 F.3d 42, 55 (1st 
Cir. 2008).                                                               
    Stopping  the  spread  of  COVID-19  in  Maine,  and  specifically  stemming 
outbreaks  in  designated  healthcare  facilities  to  protect  patients  and  healthcare 
workers, is a legitimate government interest.  For several reasons, the mandate is 

rationally related to this interest.                                      
    First,  data  collected  by  Maine  CDC  throughout  the  COVID-19  pandemic 
demonstrates that unvaccinated individuals are substantially more likely both to 
contract COVID-19 and to suffer serious medical consequences as a result.  ECF No. 
49-4 ¶¶ 16, 23, 52.  Second, the percentage of COVID-19 outbreaks occurring in 
healthcare facilities is increasing rapidly and most of these outbreaks are caused by 

healthcare workers bringing the virus into the facilities.  ECF No. 49-4 ¶¶ 46-48.  
Third,  despite  widespread  availability  of  COVID-19  vaccinations,  the  rate  of 
COVID-19 vaccinations for healthcare workers in designated healthcare facilities 
remains below the 90% threshold needed to stem facility-based outbreaks.  ECF No. 

49-4  ¶¶ 53-54.    Mandating  COVID-19  vaccinations  for  healthcare  workers  at 
designated healthcare facilities will increase the vaccination rate for a critically 
important segment of Maine’s workforce while lowering the risk of facility-based 
outbreaks.                                                                
    The State defendants have provided ample support demonstrating a rational 
basis for their adoption of the COVID-19 vaccine mandate as a requirement that 

furthers the government’s interest in protecting public health, healthcare workers, 
vulnerable patients, and Maine’s healthcare system from the spread of COVID-19. 
         5.   Strict Scrutiny Review                                     
    Although I conclude that rational basis, and not strict scrutiny, is the correct 
level of constitutional review, even if strict scrutiny were the required standard, the 
COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers still withstands the Plaintiffs’ 
Free Exercise challenge.  As previously discussed, a challenged government action 

subject to strict scrutiny may be upheld only if “it is justified by a compelling interest 
and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest.”  Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 533.  The 
government  must  also  demonstrate  that  it  “seriously  undertook  to  address  the 
problem with less intrusive tools readily available to it” and “that it considered 
different methods that other jurisdictions have found effective.”  McCullen v. Coakley, 
573 U.S. 464, 494 (2014).                                                 
             a.      Compelling Interest                                 
    Curbing the spread of COVID-19 is “unquestionably a compelling interest.”  
Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, 141 S. Ct. at 67.  Plaintiffs here admit as much, 

conceding that “[t]o be sure, efforts to contain the spread of a deadly disease are 
‘compelling interests of the highest order.’”  ECF No. 57 at 8 (quoting On Fire 
Christian Ctr., Inc. v. Fischer, 453 F. Supp. 3d 901, 910 (W.D. Ky. 2020)).    
         b.      Narrow Tailoring                                        
    The record establishes that “[t]he gold standard to prevent and stop the spread 
of communicable diseases, including COVID-19, is vaccination.”  ECF No. 49-4 at 

¶ 34.  High vaccination rates minimize the number of unvaccinated individuals in 
group  settings—such  as  healthcare  environments—which  ultimately  facilitates 
population-level immunity and prevents outbreaks of these diseases both within 
these settings and in the general population.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶¶ 35-37.  Achieving 
the high levels of vaccination needed to establish population-level immunity is crucial 
to protect the health of the most vulnerable individuals, including “individuals with 
weakened immune systems, infants too young to be vaccinated, and persons unable 

to be vaccinated.”  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶¶ 38-39.  For “individuals undergoing treatment 
for serious diseases, and individuals who have a demonstrated allergy to one of the 
vaccine components,” certain vaccinations are inadvisable for medical reasons.  ECF 
No. 49-4 at ¶ 39.  For these people, receiving a particular vaccine could have adverse 
health consequences.  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 39.                               
    The Plaintiffs’ sole challenge to the scientific rationale put forward by the State 

Defendants for the vaccine mandate is based on the Plaintiffs’ citation to an article 
published in National Geographic Magazine that reports on a preliminary study that 
found that vaccinated persons with breakthrough COVID-19 infections can transmit 
the virus.  This preliminary finding, however, does not address the broader question 

of whether COVID-19 vaccinations reduce the risk of people spreading the virus that 
causes COVID-19.  According to the CDC, they do.  CDC, Key Things to Know About 
COVID-19  Vaccines,  (Oct.  7,  2021),  https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-
ncov/vaccines/keythingstoknow.html  (“COVID-19  vaccines  can  reduce  the  risk  of 
people  spreading  the  virus  that  causes  COVID-19.”).    Nor  does  the  National 
Geographic  article  address  the  related  question  of  whether  vaccinated  persons 

become infected at a lesser rate than unvaccinated persons and whether vaccinations 
provide substantial protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations.  On these points 
as well, the CDC indicates that they do.  Id.  (“People can sometimes get COVID-19 
after being fully vaccinated.  However, this only happens in a small proportion of 
people, even with the Delta variant.  When these infections occur among vaccinated 
people, they tend to be mild.”); see also Ashley Fowlkes et al., Effectiveness of COVID-
19 Vaccines in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Frontline Workers Before 

and  During  B.1.617.2  (Delta)  Variant  Predominance—Eight  U.S.  Locations, 
December    2020–August    2021,    CDC     (Aug.    27,    2021),        
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm?s_cid=mm7034e4_w;     
Wesley H. Self, et al., Comparative Effectiveness of Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and 
Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) Vaccines in Preventing COVID-19 Hospitalizations 
Among Adults Without Immunocompromising Conditions—United States, March–  

August       2021,       CDC         (Sept.       24,       2021),        
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w.     
The study cited by the Plaintiffs does not establish a lack of narrow tailoring for 
purposes of strict scrutiny analysis.  If vaccinated individuals are less likely to become 

infected, they are less likely to transmit the disease.  The preliminary study cited by 
the Plaintiffs does not call this crucial point into question.            
    Plaintiffs further contend that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is not the least 
restrictive  means  of achieving  the  State’s  goal  to  protect  public  health and  the 
healthcare  system  from  communicable  disease.  They  argue  that  there  are 
alternatives to vaccination that would not restrict their religious beliefs, and that 

Maine has not demonstrated that these alternatives would not achieve the objectives 
of the Rule.  Plaintiffs specifically point to the use of PPE and frequent testing as less 
restrictive tactics that Maine could employ.                              
    The record demonstrates that PPE and regular testing are not sufficient to 
achieve Maine’s compelling interest in stopping the spread of COVID-19.  Regular 
testing,  an  alternative  method  proposed  by  the  Plaintiffs,  was  considered  and 
ultimately rejected because “regular testing for the presence of the virus in employees 

is insufficient to protect against the Delta variant.”  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 61. The speed 
of the Delta variant’s transmission outpaces test-result availability.  ECF No. 49-4 at 
¶¶ 61-62.  With weekly or twice-weekly testing, “[a]n employee who tests negative on 
a Monday morning could be exposed that afternoon, and, within 36 hours, could be 
spreading the virus to others over the course of the several days until the next test.”  
ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 61.  Further, “[b]ecause test results are not available for at least 

24 hours, and sometimes up to 72 hours, daily PCR testing is insufficient for the same 
reasons.”  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 61.  Daily testing, therefore, would require the use of 
rapid antigen tests, which are both less accurate and in short supply.  ECF No. 49-4 
at ¶ 62.  Accordingly, regular testing is not an alternative measure that would 

effectively serve to stop the spread of COVID-19.                         
    The use of PPE is also not an equivalent alternative measure.  PPE is an 
important  measure  to  prevent  the  spread  of  transmissible  diseases,  including 
COVID-19,  but  “it  does  not  eliminate  the  possibility  of  spreading  COVID-19, 
especially in healthcare settings.”  ECF No. 49-4 at ¶ 64.  Maine healthcare facilities 
have  utilized  PPE  and  other  practices,  including  regular  testing  and  symptom 

monitoring, to reduce healthcare facility-based COVID-19 outbreaks.  ECF No. 49-4 
at ¶ 65.  These measures have not been sufficient to prevent these outbreaks.  In the 
face of the Delta variant and rising percentage of healthcare facility-based outbreaks, 
they are not alternative equivalent measures that would achieve the compelling 
interest of curbing the spread of COVID-19.                               
    Next, Plaintiffs argue that Maine currently stands alone in the nation by not 
providing religious exemptions to vaccine mandates for healthcare workers, 15 which 

necessarily  demonstrates  that  less  restrictive  alternatives  are  available.    The 
Plaintiffs reason that if every other state has been able to offer religious exemptions 


 15  At least two other states have adopted COVID-19 vaccine mandates which do not provide religious 
exemptions.  In August 2021, the State of New York mandated COVID-19 vaccinations for healthcare 
workers in the state and did not include a religious exemption within the mandate.  Dr. A. v. Hochul, 
No. 1:21-cv-1009, 2021 WL 4189533 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2021).  A preliminary injunction against the 
requirement was granted on October 12, 2021, Dr. A. v. Hochul, No. 1:21-cv-1009 (N.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 
2021); as previously discussed, this case is distinguishable from Maine’s vaccine mandate.  Rhode 
Island has also mandated COVID-19 vaccinations for healthcare workers and did not provide for 
religious exemptions to that requirement; a temporary injunction was denied on September 30, 2021.  
to COVID-19 mandates, Maine should as well.  However, the Plaintiffs have not 
provided  any  scientific  or  expert  evidence  demonstrating  the  efficacy  of  the 
approaches adopted in other states.  Maine may be one of the first states to conclude 

that it is wise to mandate vaccinations for certain healthcare workers, but it does not 
follow  that  other,  less  demanding  approaches  are  equally  effective  or  even 
appropriate  given  the  circumstances  presented  in  this  state.    The  Government 
Defendants assert that unlike many other states, “the size of Maine’s healthcare 
workforce is limited, such that the impact of any outbreaks among personnel is far 
greater than it would be in a state with more extensive healthcare delivery systems.”  

ECF  No.  49-4  at  ¶  66.    The  Plaintiffs  have  not  presented  any  expert  witness 
declarations, science-based reports or data, or any other information to support their 
argument that there are equally effective, less restrictive alternatives to the vaccine 
mandate.  Based on the record before me, there is no basis to conclude that, as the 
Plaintiffs’ position suggests, what may be good enough for other states is necessarily 
equally good for the conditions presented in Maine.                       
    Accordingly,  I  conclude  that  the  COVID-19  vaccine  mandate  is  narrowly 

tailored to serve the compelling interest of containing the spread of this serious 
communicable disease.  Even if strict scrutiny were required, the Plaintiffs have not 
shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their Free Exercise claim 
against the Defendants.                                                   
B.    Title VII                                                           
    Seven plaintiffs16 assert that the Hospital Defendants refused to consider or 
grant religious accommodations by failing to grant exemptions from the vaccine 

mandate and that this refusal violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 
U.S.C.A. § 2000e to e-17 (West 2021).                                     
    Title VII forbids an employer “to discriminate against, any individual because 
of his . . . religion.” 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-2(c)(1).  Discrimination is effected through an 
adverse employment action: “a significant change in employment status, such as 
hiring,  firing,  failing  to  promote,  reassignment  with  significantly  different 
responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.”  Burlington 

Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 761 (1998).  Title VII requires that employers 
“offer  a  reasonable  accommodation  to  resolve  a  conflict  between  an  employee’s 
sincerely  held  religious  belief  and  a  condition  of  employment,  unless  such  an 
accommodation  would  create  an  undue  hardship  for  the  employer’s  business.”  
Cloutier v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 390 F.3d 126, 133 (1st Cir. 2004).    
    The  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  Hospital  Defendants  have  unlawfully 

discriminated against them by refusing to grant exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine 
mandate and terminating, or threatening to terminate, their employment for abiding 
by their sincerely held religious beliefs.  At the time of filing, Plaintiffs had not 
exhausted the administrative remedies available to them for their claim of unlawful 
employment discrimination, such as pursuing a complaint with the Maine Human 
Rights Commission or Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.             
    The  Supreme  Court  has  “set  a  high  standard  for  obtaining  preliminary 
injunctions restraining termination of employment.”  Bedrossian v. Nw. Mem’l Hosp., 
409 F.3d 840, 845 (7th Cir. 2005) (citing Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974)).  

The case must present a “genuinely extraordinary situation” to support granting an 
injunction, Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 n.68; allegations of “humiliation, damage to 
reputation, and loss of income” are insufficient to meet that standard, Bedrossian, 
409 F.3d at 845, as are “deterioration in skills” and “inability to find another job,” id. 
at 846.  Courts generally do not grant preliminary injunctions to prevent termination 
of employment, because “the termination . . . of employment typically [is] not found 

to result in irreparable injury.”  11A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, & Mary 
Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (3d ed. 2021).  Injuries incurred 
in employment discrimination claims may be addressed through remedies at law, 
such as reinstatement, back pay, and damages.  42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-5(g).  In addition, 
in the ordinary course, Title VII violations must be addressed first through the 
administrative processes available under federal law.  See 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e-
5(f)(1)), see also Rodriguez v. United States, 852 F.3d 67, 78 (1st Cir. 2017) (“It is 

settled that a federal court will not entertain employment discrimination claims 
brought under Title VII unless administrative remedies have first been exhausted.”).  
    The Plaintiffs have not shown that the injuries they have suffered or may 
suffer—the loss of their employment and economic harm—meet the high standard for 
preliminary injunctive relief required to restrain an employer from terminating an 
employee’s employment.   Administrative remedies are available to the Plaintiffs that 

have not been exhausted.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a 
likelihood  of  success  on  their  Title  VII  claims  to  the  degree  needed  to  support 
preliminary injunctive relief.                                            
C.   Equal Protection Clause                                              

    The  Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  COVID-19  vaccine  mandate  impermissibly 
creates a class of religious objectors and then subjects them to disparate treatment, 
in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  “[W]here a law subject to an equal 
protection challenge ‘does not violate [a plaintiff’s] right of free exercise of religion,’ 
courts do not ‘apply to the challenged classification a standard of scrutiny stricter 
than the traditional rational-basis test.’”  W.D., 521 F. Supp. 3d at 410 (second 
alteration in original) (quoting A.M. ex rel. Messineo v. French, 431 F. Supp. 3d 432, 

446 (D. Vt. 2019)); accord Wirzburger v. Galvin, 412 F.3d 271, 282-83 (1st Cir. 2005) 
(“Because we [hold] that the [challenged law] does not violate the Free Exercise 
Clause, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the fundamental rights based claim that 
[the law] violates equal protection.”).                                   
    As described above, because the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood 
of success on their Free Exercise Clause claim and I have found, at this stage, that 

the vaccine mandate is rationally based, the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a 
likelihood of success that their Equal Protection claim is warranted, and no additional 
analysis is required.                                                     
D.   Conspiracy                                                           
    The Plaintiffs claim that the State and Hospital Defendants conspired to 
violate their civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.A. § 1985, but provide only conclusory, 
nonfactual allegations in support.  Because a violation of Plaintiffs’ First Amendment 
rights  has  not  been  demonstrated,  and  the  Plaintiffs  have  not  submitted  any 
declarations  or  other  documentary  evidence  showing  a  conspiracy  among  the 
Defendants, no additional analysis regarding the claimed conspiracy is warranted. 

E.   Supremacy Clause                                                     
    Finally, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants violated the Supremacy 
Clause of the U.S. Constitution by ignoring federal law and proceeding as if Maine 
law supersedes federal law.                                               
    The Supremacy Clause “is not the ‘source of any federal rights,’ and certainly 
does not create a cause of action.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 
320, 324-25 (2015) (quoting Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 

107 (1989)).  Rather, the Supremacy Clause “creates a rule of decision” that “instructs 
courts what to do when state and federal law clash.”  Id.  Additionally, the Plaintiffs’ 
assertion that “Defendants have explicitly claimed to healthcare workers in Maine, 
including Plaintiffs, that federal law does not apply” in Maine is wholly unsupported 
by the record.  ECF No. 1 at ¶ 1.                                         
    The  Plaintiffs  have  not  demonstrated  a  likelihood  of  success  on  their 

Supremacy Clause claim.                                                   
F.    Irreparable Harm, Balancing of the Equities, and Effect of the Court’s 
    Action on the Public Interest                                        

    Where plaintiffs fail to meet their burden to show a likelihood of success on the 
merits,  “failure  to  do  so  is  itself  preclusive  of  the  requested  relief.”    Bayley’s 
Campground, Inc. v. Mills, 985 F.3d 153, 158 (1st Cir. 2021).  In the interest of 
completeness,  though,  I  address  the  three  remaining  prongs  of  the  preliminary 
    First, the harm faced by Plaintiffs Jane Does 1 through 6 and John Does 2 
through 3 is the loss of their employment, which, while serious and substantial, is not 
irreparable.  These plaintiffs may pursue remedies at law for alleged discriminatory 

firings, including reinstatement, back pay, and damages.  Although John Doe 1, as a 
healthcare provider, faces the possibility of more consequential harm through the 
potential loss of a business license, that harm does not outweigh the other factors I 
must consider.                                                            
    Second, the balance of equities favors the Defendants because of the strong 
public interest promoted by the vaccine mandate, which includes preventing facility-

based COVID-19 outbreaks that risk the health of vulnerable patients, healthcare 
workers, and the infrastructure of Maine’s healthcare system itself.  If Plaintiffs were 
granted injunctive relief preventing the Rule from being enforced, these objectives 
would be thwarted.  See Bayley’s Campground Inc. v. Mills, 463 F. Supp. 22, 38 (D. 
Me.  2020)  (denying  injunctive  relief  against  Maine’s  COVID-19  quarantine 
requirement for out-of-state visitors because “[t]he type of injunctive relief Plaintiffs 
seek would upset the bedrock of the state’s public health response to COVID-19, an 

area this Court does not wade into lightly”), aff’d, 985 F.3d 153 (1st Cir. 2021). 
    Finally, the vaccine mandate is directly aimed at promoting the public interest.  
This factor weighs heavily against granting preliminary injunctive relief in this case.  
Many  courts  that  have  examined  requests  for  preliminary  injunctions  against 
COVID-19  restrictions  have  come  to  this  same  conclusion,  as  it  is  clear  that 
“[w]eakening  the  State’s  response  to  a  public-health  crisis  by  enjoining  it  from 

enforcing measures employed specifically to stop the spread of COVID-19 is not in 
the public interest.”  Bimber’s Delwood, Inc. v. James, 496 F. Supp. 3d 760, 789 
(W.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 2020); see also Harris, 2021 WL 3848012, at *8 (“[G]iven the public 
health efforts promoted by the [COVID-19] Vaccine Policy, enjoining the continuation 

of same is not in the public interest.”); Klaassen, 2021 WL 3073926, at *43 (noting 
that when individuals refuse vaccination, “the evidence reasonably shows that they 
aren’t the only ones harmed by refusing to get vaccinated: refusing while also not 
complying with heightened safety precautions could ‘sicken and even kill many others 
who did not consent to that trade-off,’” which “certainly impacts the public interest” 
(quoting  Cassell  v.  Snyders,  990 F.3d  539,  550  (7th  Cir.  2021)).    So  too,  here.  

Enjoining the Rule is not in the public interest.                         
    Thus, in addition to failing to show a likelihood of success on the merits, I find 
that the Plaintiffs have not demonstrated an entitlement to relief under any of the 
three other factors in the preliminary injunction inquiry.                
                         V. CONCLUSION                                   
    Both the serious risk of illness and death associated with the spread of the 
COVID-19 virus and the efforts by state and local governments to reduce that risk 

have burdened most aspects of modern life.  In this case, the Plaintiffs—healthcare 
workers and a healthcare provider—have shown that their refusal to be vaccinated 
based on their religious beliefs has resulted or will result in real hardships as it 
relates to their jobs.  They have not, however, been prevented from staying true to 
their professed religious beliefs which, they claim, compel them to refuse to be 
vaccinated against COVID-19.  Neither have they seriously challenged the compelling 
governmental interest in mandating vaccinations for Maine’s healthcare workers, nor 
have they demonstrated that, as they contend, the vaccine mandate was motivated 
by any improper animus toward religion.                                   
    Because the Plaintiffs have not established grounds that would warrant the 

entry of a preliminary injunction enjoining the enforcement of Maine’s Covid-19 
vaccine mandate for healthcare workers, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction (ECF 
No. 3) is DENIED.                                                         

    SO ORDERED.                                                          
    Dated this 13th day of October, 2021.

ORDER ON PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO PROCEED UNDER PSEUDONYMS                   
                AND FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER                                

   The Plaintiffs in this case are Maine healthcare workers and one individual 
healthcare provider, who challenge recent changes to Maine law which, they contend, 
have  the  effect  of  requiring  all  employees  of  Maine  healthcare  facilities  to  be 
vaccinated against the COVID-19 coronavirus by October 1, 2021.  On August 25, 
2021, the Plaintiffs filed a five-count Complaint against Janet T. Mills, the Governor 
of Maine; Dr. Nirav D. Shah, the Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control 
and  Prevention  (MCDC);  Jeanne  M.  Lambrew,  the  Commissioner  of  the  Maine 
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); and five incorporated entities 
that operate healthcare facilities in Maine1 (the “Hospital Defendants”) (ECF No. 1).  
The Plaintiffs contend that the Emergency Rule issued by the Department of Health 
and Human Services and Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 10-144 
C.M.R.  ch.  264,  §  2(A)  (effective  Aug.  12,  2021),  which  mandates  vaccines  for 

1 Specifically, the Hospital Defendants are Genesis Healthcare of Maine, LLC; Genesis Healthcare, 
healthcare workers, and the Hospital Defendants’ actions in enforcing it, violate 
federal law.                                                              
   The Plaintiffs seek permission to proceed using pseudonyms, as well as a 

protective order restricting the Defendants’ access to their identities (ECF No. 21).  
For the reasons that follow, I grant the Plaintiffs’ motion in part and deny the motion 
in part.                                                                  
                      I.  BACKGROUND                                    
   The  Complaint  names  and  describes  the  Plaintiffs  using  the  following 
pseudonyms:  Jane Does 1-5 and John Does 2-3 are healthcare workers employed by 

the Hospital Defendants; John Doe 1 is a licensed healthcare provider who operates 
his own practice; and Jane Doe 6 is a healthcare worker employed by John Doe 1.  
Additionally, the Complaint names two thousand nominal parties—Jack Does 1 
through 1000 and Joan Does 1 through 1000—who are allegedly healthcare workers 
employed by the Hospital Defendants, but who have not yet been identified.   
   The Plaintiffs assert that they have sincerely held religious objections to the 
COVID-19 vaccine, and that the lack of a religious exemption to Maine’s vaccination 

requirement violates their federal constitutional and statutory rights.  They contend 
that the highly sensitive nature of the case, which involves their personal medical 
decisions as well as their religious beliefs, as well as the threat of retribution and 
retaliation from the Defendants and from the public at large, justifies a court order 
restricting access to their identities.                                   
                       II.  DISCUSSION                                  
   In their motion, the Plaintiffs seek two forms of protection.  First, they request 
leave to proceed pseudonymously, i.e., to shield their identities from the public at 

large.  Second, they ask the Court to issue a protective order that would restrict 
disclosure of their identities even to the Defendants; specifically, they request an 
“attorney’s-eyes-only”  provision  in  which  the  Plaintiffs’  identities  would  only  be 
known by Defendants’ attorneys and no one else.                           
1.   Proceeding Under Pseudonym                                           
   “There is a strong common law presumption favoring public access to judicial 

proceedings and records,” and in general, a case must proceed in the real names of 
the parties.  Doe v. Reg’l Sch. Unit No. 21, No. 2:19-00341-NT, 2020 WL 2833248, at 
*1 (D. Me. May 29, 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted).  However, federal courts 
permit parties to proceed under pseudonym in some circumstances.  See id.  Although 
neither  the  Supreme  Court  nor  the  First  Circuit  has  specifically  explained  the 
circumstances under which a plaintiff may proceed pseudonymously, other circuit 
courts “have developed balancing tests specifically for assessing whether the use of a 

pseudonym should be permitted.”  Id. at *2.  Courts in the First Circuit have generally 
followed the Third Circuit’s test, which sets forth nine factors which ultimately focus 
on “whether a litigant has a reasonable fear of severe harm that outweighs the 
public’s interest in open litigation.”  Doe v. Megless, 654 F.3d 404, 409 (3d Cir. 2011); 
see Reg’l Sch. Unit No. 21, 2020 WL 2833248, at *2; Doe v. Trs. of Dartmouth Coll., 
No. 18-cv-040-LM, 2018 WL 2048385, at *4-5 (D. Mass. May 2, 2018).        
   After considering the Megless factors in conjunction with the limited record 
available at this point, as well as the Defendants’ failure to object to the Plaintiffs 
proceeding pseudonymously, I conclude that the Plaintiffs have a reasonable fear of 

harm that outweighs the public’s interest in open litigation at this preliminary stage.  
In  arriving  at  this  conclusion,  I  take  judicial  notice  of  the  substantial  public 
controversy currently surrounding public and private mandates requiring individuals 
to be vaccinated for the COVID-19 coronavirus or to provide proof of vaccination 
status.  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(1).  Thus, the Plaintiffs will be permitted to proceed 
under pseudonyms.  However, the Court reserves the authority to revisit this issue 

should the case proceed past the preliminary-injunction stage.            
2.   Scope of the Protective Order                                        
   A court may issue a protective order upon a showing of “good cause.”  Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 26(c)(1).  Within the context of a protective order, “an ‘attorneys’ eyes only’ 
designation is highly restrictive, and . . . the party requesting such an order [] has the 
initial burden to ‘describe the alleged harm it will suffer from any disclosure with a 
particular and specific demonstration of fact.’”  Perez v. Bodega Latina Corp., No. EP-

19-CV-00360, 2021 WL 3272211 (W.D. Tex. July 30, 2021).  Additionally, I must 
consider whether the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a strong interest in designating 
their identities as “attorneys eyes only” that outweighs a competing need of the 
defendants to know the plaintiffs’ identities to participate meaningfully in the case.  
Reese v. Liberty, No. 1:18-cv-00421, 2019 WL 5549219 at *1 (D. Me. Oct. 25, 2019).   
   The Plaintiffs contend that their identities must be protected from public 
disclosure and limited to attorneys’ eyes only2 to avoid retribution and retaliation 
from  their  employers  and  from  government  officials.    In  response,  the  State 

Defendants agree that a protective order limiting public disclosure of the Plaintiffs’ 
identities is reasonable, but argue that an “attorneys eyes only” provision will be 
“unworkable” because it would impede the State Defendants’ ability to prepare their 
defense.  ECF No. 25 at 6.                                                
   As described above, I find that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause to 
protect their identities from public disclosure at this preliminary stage.  However, I 

am not persuaded that the Plaintiffs’ concerns about retribution and retaliation apply 
if the identities are disclosed to the State Defendants.  The Plaintiffs do not contend 
that any one plaintiff is employed by the State Defendants.  To the extent that the 
Plaintiffs suggest that, as holders of state-issued healthcare licenses, they may be 
subjected to retribution and retaliation by the State Defendants, they have offered no 
credible support for that fear.  As public officials, the State Defendants are sworn to 
uphold the law and can be held to account if they fail to do so.  Moreover, the Plaintiffs’ 

state-issued licenses are property interests and thus protected by the rights of due 
process and equal protection guaranteed by the Federal and Maine Constitutions.   


2 In support of this request, Plaintiffs cite inapposite case law in which the anonymity of witnesses 
rather than parties was protected.  See MacNamara v. City of New York, 249 F.R.D. 70 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) 
(protecting the identity of undercover police officers); Were v. Bobby, No. 1:10-cv-698, 2019 WL 7046593 
(S.D. Ohio Dec. 23, 2019) (protecting the identity of cooperating witnesses).  Plaintiffs’ reliance on 
Aguilar v. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Division is similarly misplaced, No. 07 Civ. 8224, 2009 
WL 1789336 (E.D.N.Y. June 23, 2018), as that decision restricted the plaintiffs’ identities from the 
defendants because the defendants occupied the unique role of both assisting in the case’s defense and 
prosecuting parallel immigration cases.  Here, as the government points out, the State Defendants do 
   On the other side of the scale, the State Defendants point out that without 
knowing the Plaintiffs’ identities, they will be unable to assess the Complaint’s 
factual allegations and potentially challenge the Plaintiffs’ standing to sue and the 

Court’s exercise of jurisdiction.  See Hochendoner v. Genzyme Corp., 823 F.3d 724, 
730 (1st Cir. 2016).  Additionally, resolving the merits of the Plaintiffs’ motion for 
preliminary injunction will require the Court to consider the public interest and 
weigh the comparative burdens on the parties if a preliminary injunction is granted 
or denied.  See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Shielding the 
Plaintiffs’ identities from the State Defendants would impede the State Defendants’ 

ability to present arguments addressing the severity of the burden that a preliminary 
injunction might impose.                                                  
   In addition, although a preliminary injunction would be addressed to the three 
named state officials, it would potentially influence the behavior of a host of other 
state and local officials whom are charged with enforcing state law and protecting 
public health.  Thus, a careful assessment of the consequences of the grant or denial 
of a preliminary injunction is vital.  That assessment will be advanced by the ability 

of  all  of  the  parties  to  this  case  to  frame  their  arguments  in  relation  to  the 
circumstances associated with the actual persons who have invoked the Court’s 
jurisdiction and seek judicial redress.                                   
   Accordingly, a Protective Order will issue which limits the disclosure of the 
Plaintiffs’ identities to the State Defendants, but without the “attorneys’ eyes only” 
limitation that Plaintiffs seek.  A hearing will be convened to address the terms of 

the Protective Order.  Counsel for the parties are directed to consider and be prepared 
to address the elements of the protective order issued in Doe v. Provident Life & 
Accident Ins. Co., 176 F.R.D. 464, 470-71 (E.D. Pa. 1997).                
                      III.  CONCLUSION                                  

   For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Proceed Under Pseudonyms 
and for Protective Order (ECF No. 21) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  
The Court will convene a hearing today at 1:30 p.m. to address the issuance of a 
protective order.                                                         

   SO ORDERED.
