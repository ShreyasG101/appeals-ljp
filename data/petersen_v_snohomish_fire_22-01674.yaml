reason_for_appeal: '=== David Petersen, Jay Stickney, Beau Watson, Evan Merritt, Norm Alan Peterson II, Riley Korf, Ryan Stupey, and Kevin Gleason''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to SRFR on their Title VII claim because SRFR failed to reasonably accommodate their sincerely held religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination requirement and could have accommodated their exemption requests without incurring an undue hardship.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to SRFR on their Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD) claim because, under the applicable Washington standard (which they asserted mirrors the federal standard post-Groff), SRFR did not demonstrate that accommodating their religious objections would have imposed an undue hardship.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that SRFR overstated the health and safety risks of allowing unvaccinated firefighters to work and that their proposed accommodations—masking, testing, social distancing, and related mitigation measures—would have allowed them to safely perform their jobs without materially increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission to coworkers or the public.

  4. Plaintiffs contended that SRFR exaggerated the operational burden posed by their exemption requests, asserting that the actual number of firefighters who ultimately needed accommodation was smaller than the initial 46 requests and that SRFR could have continued operations effectively while accommodating them.

  5. Plaintiffs argued that SRFR’s asserted financial and contractual risks, including the potential loss of the Department of Corrections contract and possible uninsured liability for COVID-19 transmission, were speculative or hypothetical and therefore insufficient to establish undue hardship.

  6. Plaintiffs further contended that, viewed in light of how SRFR had previously managed the pandemic without a vaccine mandate and how other nearby fire departments allowed unvaccinated firefighters to continue working (including hiring one of the plaintiffs while he was on leave from SRFR), SRFR’s refusal to accommodate them was unreasonable and not justified by the circumstances at the time.'
