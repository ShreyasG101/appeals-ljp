outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Andy Luu Tran''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Tran argued that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that the only ''transfer'' under 11 U.S.C. § 544(a)(3) was the extinguishment of his equity of redemption at the foreclosure sale, rather than the transfer of legal title via the foreclosure deed.

  2. Tran contended that the foreclosure deed was improperly recorded because it lacked the required certificate of acknowledgment, and therefore did not provide constructive notice to a hypothetical bona fide purchaser under Massachusetts law.

  3. Tran argued that the properly recorded affidavit of sale was insufficient to provide constructive notice of the extinguishment of his equity of redemption or the transfer of his property interest.

  4. Tran claimed that he retained post-foreclosure rights, including an entitlement to surplus proceeds and a possessory interest in the property, which supported his avoidance action.

  5. Tran asserted that the affidavit of sale ''lives or dies'' with the deed, such that if the deed is void, so is the affidavit, and thus neither could provide constructive notice.'
