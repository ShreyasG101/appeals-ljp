outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Robert Arias''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Arias argued that the District Court erred in ruling that, because of the Inspector General Act''s (IGA) administrative remedy, his excessive force claims necessarily arise in a new context compared to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics.

  2. Arias contended that, aside from the IGA, his excessive force claims arise in the same context as Bivens and therefore the Bivens remedy should be available for his claims.

  3. Arias argued that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on his excessive force claims on the basis that the IGA''s alternative remedial scheme precluded a Bivens remedy.'
