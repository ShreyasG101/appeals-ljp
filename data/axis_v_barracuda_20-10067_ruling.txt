                             MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

     This case arises out of a 2018 data breach that compromised

the protected health information of more than 277,000 patients

of Zoll Services LLC, a subsidiary of Zoll Medical (together,

“Zoll”).   Pending before the Court is the motion of defendant

Barracuda Network, Inc. (“Barracuda”) for summary judgment on

three claims, which survived a motion to dismiss, brought by

plaintiff Axis Insurance Co. (“Axis”), as assignee of Zoll and

subrogee of Fusion LLC (“Fusion”).          For the reasons that follow,

the motion will be allowed.

I.   Background

     This Court has recited the lengthy and complex background

of this action in its prior memoranda and orders. See, e.g.,

                                    - 1 -

Axis Ins. Co. v. Barracuda Networks, Inc., No. CV 20-11997-NMG,

2024 WL 3458143, at *1 (D. Mass. July 17, 2024); Axis Ins. Co.

v. Barracuda Networks, Inc., No. CV 20-11997-NMG, 2023 WL

2838380, at *1-*2 (D. Mass. Apr. 7, 2023).       The following

addresses only the background relevant to the pending motion.

     A. Factual Background

     Fusion sells hosted business communications products. In

2012, a company that is now a subsidiary of Fusion entered into

an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) agreement with a

company that has since merged with Barracuda.        The OEM agreement

provided for customer communications and email management

software and related services.     At approximately the same time,

Fusion entered a Hosting Services Agreement (“HSA”) with Zoll

that would provide Zoll with cloud-based messaging software and

services for electronic messages and email communications.

     In 2018, a Barracuda employee allegedly left a data port in

its system open during a standard data migration in its network.

In the approximately seven weeks before the error was detected,

protected health information (“PHI”) from Zoll patients was

apparently accessed by unauthorized third parties.         In early

2019, Barracuda advised Fusion of the breach, although Fusion

claims Barracuda misrepresented its magnitude and the prior




                                 - 2 -
     Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 3 of 16



existence of “reasonable and readily available security

protocols and products.”

     B. Procedural Background

     In 2020, Zoll filed an action against Barracuda in this

Court, asserting claims for negligence, breach of implied

warranties, breach of contract, and equitable indemnification.

Fusion was allowed to intervene in this case under Fed. R. Civ.

P. 20 and proceeded to bring actions for breach of contract,

breach of the covenant of good faith, negligent

misrepresentation, tortious interference and equitable

indemnification.   In a previous order, the Court dismissed all

of those claims except Zoll’s claim of equitable indemnification

and Fusion’s claims of breach of contract and breach of the

covenant of good faith.

     Pursuant to a previous arbitration settlement, any claims

Zoll and Fusion had against Barracuda in connection with the

data breach were assigned to Axis.       Axis, the only remaining

party in interest, was substituted as plaintiff in 2022, at

which time Fusion and Zoll were dismissed as parties.

     Now, Barracuda moves for summary judgment against Axis

under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 on the three remaining claims.

III. Motion for Summary Judgment

     Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, summary judgment is warranted

where “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact” and

thus “the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of

law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,

Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249 (1986).      A fact is “material” if it “is

one that affects the outcome of the suit,” id. at 48; see Patco

Constr. Co. v. People’s United Bank, 683 F.3d 197, 207 (1st Cir.

2012), and a “genuine issue” exists as to that material fact if

“there is sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual

dispute,” Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.

1990).   For a claim to survive summary judgment, the plaintiff

must provide a sufficient evidentiary basis to establish each

essential element of the claims at issue. Katz v. Belveron Real

Est. Partners, LLC, 28 F.4th 300, 307 (1st Cir. 2022).

     A. Equitable Indemnification

     Barracuda first asserts that Zoll’s equitable

indemnification claim fails as a matter of law because Zoll

lacks a “special relationship” with Barracuda and,

alternatively, because Zoll is a party at fault and therefore

lacks “clean hands” to seek equitable indemnification.

     A valid claim of indemnification can arise under

Massachusetts law in one of three circumstances: 1) where there


                                 - 4 -
     Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 5 of 16



is an express contractual agreement to indemnify, 2) where an

agreement to indemnify can be “implied from the nature of the

relationship between the parties,” or 3) where there is “a tort

based right to indemnification” based on “a great disparity in

the fault of the parties.” Araujo v. Woods Hole, Martha’s

Vineyard, Nantucket S.S. Auth., 693 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1982).

The claim at issue concerns only the third circumstance, a tort-

based, or equitable, right of indemnification.

     Equitable indemnification allows a party “who is without

fault, compelled by operation of law to defend himself against

the wrongful act of another, to recover from the wrongdoer the

entire amount of the loss.” Santos v. Chrysler Corp., 715 N.E.2d

47, 62 (Mass. 1999).    An equitable indemnification claim does

not require proof of a contractual relationship between the

parties. Fireside Motors, Inc. v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A.,

479 N.E.2d 1386, 1388 (Mass. 1985).      Instead, it arises under

equitable principals and is available where there is a

“derivative or vicarious relationship” between the indemnitor

and indemnitee. Santos, 715 N.E.2d at 62; see Wade v. Touchdown

Realty Grp., LLC, 386 F. Supp. 3d 56, 67 (D. Mass. 2019) (“[T]he

right to indemnity is limited to those cases where the

person . . . is held derivatively or vicariously liable for the

wrongful act of another.” (emphasis omitted) (quoting Ferreira



                                 - 5 -
     Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 6 of 16



v. Chrysler Grp. LLC, 13 N.E.3d 561, 567 (Mass. 2014)).1

Derivative or vicarious liability can emerge only “because of

the relationship between the two parties.” Chapman v. Finnegan,

950 F. Supp. 2d 285, 292 n.4 (D. Mass. 2013).

     Here, nothing in the record suggests that Zoll and

Barracuda shared any relationship recognized under Massachusetts

law as giving rise to derivative or vicarious liability.          The

relationship at issue between Zoll and Barracuda can best be

described as one of an independent contractor.        As Barracuda

contends, the OEM agreement between the parties established that

Zoll operated as an independent contractor, not as an agent.

While not dispositive, the inclusion of a provision that a party

is an independent contractor is significant evidence that the

parties’ relationship is as such.        See Theos & Sons, Inc. v.

Mack Trucks, Inc., 729 N.E.2d 1113, 1120 (Mass. 2000).         Axis

makes no claim that Zoll was anything more than an independent

contractor to Barracuda.

     Barracuda’s status as an independent contractor with

respect to Zoll fails to create derivative or vicarious

liability to those with whom Barracuda contracts.        See Lyon v.


     1 Contrary to Barracuda’s assertion, an equitable
indemnification claim does not require a “special relationship”
between the parties to be actionable. Cf. Arujo, 693 F.2d at 3.
(requiring “special relationship between the parties” for
“implied contract” indemnification claim); Decker v. Black &
Decker Mfg. Co., 449 N.E.2d 641, 643 (Mass. 1983) (same).
                                 - 6 -
     Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 7 of 16



Morphew, 678 N.E.2d 1306, 1310 (Mass. 1997) (“In general, an

employer of an independent contractor is not liable for harm

caused to another by the independent contractor’s negligence.”);

see also Decker, 449 N.E.2d at 643 (holding that relationship

between manufacturer and supplier of equipment does not give

rise to vicarious or derivative liability necessary for

equitable indemnification claim).        Axis makes no claim that

derivative liability exists here even in spite of the

independent contract status. Cf. Lyon, 678 N.E.2d at 1310

(stating independent contractor status can give rise to

derivative liability where there is evidence of employer control

over independent contractor).

     Axis likewise does not contend that Barracuda shared with

Zoll any other form of recognized relationship that would create

the derivative or vicarious liability necessary for a viable

equitable indemnification claim. See Leonard v. Lumbermens Mut.

Cas. Co., 10 N.E.2d 469, 470 (Mass. 1937) (recognizing existence

of derivative liability based on agency relationship); see also

Hollywood Barbecue Co. v. Morse, 50 N.E.2d 55, 56 (Mass. 1943)

(recognizing derivative liability arising from master-servant

relationship); Tenedios v. Wm. Filene’s Sons Co., 20 Mass. App.

Ct. 252, 257, 479 N.E.2d 723, 727 (1985) (recognizing derivative

liability based on employer and employee relationship); accord

McGuire v. Reilly, 271 F. Supp. 2d 335, 342 (D. Mass. 2003),

                                 - 7 -
     Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 8 of 16



aff’d, 386 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2004) (stressing that summary

judgment is “appropriate” where “the nonmoving party fails to

show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact” in

record).

     Because the absence of a relationship that would legally

give rise to vicarious or derivative liability negates Axis’s

equitable indemnification claim, the Court need not address

Barracuda’s argument that Axis cannot recover because Zoll

lacked “clean hands.”2    While the Court previously determined

that Zoll had sufficiently pled that its fault was “vicarious in

nature” at the motion to dismiss stage, Zoll Med. Corp. v.

Barracuda Networks, Inc., 565 F. Supp. 3d 101, 110 (D. Mass.

2021), the absence of evidence of such a relationship that would

give rise to vicarious or derivative liability at the summary

judgment stage is dispositive.     See Chapman v. Bernard’s Inc.,

198 F.R.D. 575, 579 (D. Mass. 2001) (allowing summary judgment

on equitable indemnification claim because would-be indemnitor




     2 The Court recognizes that sources conflict as to whether
Massachusetts law requires a party be without fault before
claiming equitable indemnification or simply be less culpable
than the indemnitor. Compare Stewart v. Roy Bros. Inc., 265
N.E.2d 357, 365 (Mass. 1970) (holding that equitable
indemnification is available only where indemnitee “does not
join in the negligent act”), with Rathbun v. W. Mass. Elec. Co.,
395 Mass. 361, 364, 479 N.E.2d 1383, 1385 (1985) (finding no
“general rule” as to whether negligent indemnitee can recover
and noting that some prior cases have allowed negligent
indemnitee to prevail).

was “not an agent of [indemnitee], nor d[id] it have a

relationship . . . from which it could be held vicariously or

derivatively liable for the actions of [indemnitor]” and

therefore [indemnitee] was “not entitled to indemnification from

[indemnitor] under any circumstances.”); see also Walter &

Shuffain, P.C. v. CPA Mut. Ins. Co. of Am. Risk Retention Grp.,

660 F. Supp. 2d 116, 126 (D. Mass. 2009) (dismissing equitable

indemnification claim because nonmoving party “ha[d] not alleged

any facts establishing a relationship . . . that would give rise

to vicarious or derivative liability”).

     B. Breach of Contract

     Barracuda next contends that Fusion’s breach of contract

claim fails as a matter of law because Axis cannot prove that

Barracuda waived the conditions precedent in the OEM agreement,

which this Court previously determined Fusion failed to fulfill.

One such condition required Fusion to include limitation of

liability and indemnification provisions in its customer

contracts.

     Under Massachusetts law, a contractual condition precedent

is “an event [that] must occur before a contract becomes

effective or before an obligation to perform arises.” Sands v.

Ridefilm Corp., 212 F.3d 657, 661-62 (1st Cir. 2000).         If a

condition precedent is not satisfied, the contract and the


                                 - 9 -
    Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 10 of 16



obligations therein cannot be enforced. Mass. Mun. Wholesale

Elec. Co. v. Town of Danvers, 577 N.E.2d 283, 288 (Mass. 1991).

     It is well settled that conditions precedent can be waived.

See Millen Indus., Inc. v. Flexo-Accessories Co., 5 F. Supp. 2d

72, 74 (D. Mass. 1998) (“A condition precedent in favor of one

of the parties may be waived by that party.”).       Waiver occurs

when a party voluntarily relinquishes a known right.        Bos.

Helicopter Charter, Inc. v. Augusta Aviation Corp., 767 F. Supp.

363, 372 (D. Mass. 1991).    A waiver is voluntary if the party

either expressly or impliedly manifests intent to surrender a

right and no other reasonable explanation exists for that

surrender, which requires “clear, decisive and unequivocal

conduct.” Bachoroz v. Miller-Forslund, 703 F.3d 27, 32-33 (1st

Cir. 2012); Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec.

Co., 840 F.2d 985, 992 (1st Cir. 1988) (emphasis omitted).

Silence, generally, is insufficient to support waiver. Dunkin’

Donuts Inc. v. Panagakos, 5 F. Supp. 2d 57, 61 (D. Mass. 1998).

     Determining “[w]hether a condition precedent has been

waived” is usually “a question of fact.”      Millen Indus., Inc., 5

F. Supp. 2d at 74; see Wildlands Tr. of Se. Mass., Inc. v. Cedar

Hill Retreat Ctr., Inc., 160 N.E.3d 297, 305 n.12 (Mass. App.

Ct. 2020).   Here, the facts are clear that the subject OEM

agreement contains an anti-waiver provision stating that



                                - 10 -
    Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 11 of 16



     No failure or delay of [Barracuda] in exercising any right
     or remedy under this [OEM a]greement shall operate as a
     waiver of such right.

Although this provision may serve as evidence that inaction by

Barracuda does not constitute waiver, the existence of an anti-

waiver provision under Massachusetts law is “not dispositive,”

and it remains a question of fact whether waiver has in fact

occurred.   Wildlands, 160 N.E.3d at 305 n.12.3

     Barracuda contends that no evidence demonstrates a clear

and unequivocal intent to waive the OEM’s condition precedent to

overcome this operative provision.       Axis posits that Barracuda

has failed to act on its right to audit Fusion’s customer

contracts, a right it claims Barracuda held under the terms of

the OEM agreement.   Silence alone does not, however, preclude

Barracuda from summary judgment on this claim. See Dunkin’

Donuts Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d at 61 (“[I]t is doubtful that mere

silence could satisfy [the] burden of establishing clear,

decisive, and unequivocal conduct.” (internal quotations

omitted)); cf. KACT, Inc. v. Rubin, 819 N.E.2d 610, 616 (Mass.


     3 A previous session of this Court treated anti-waiver
clauses as determinative to preventing waiver, see Blue Hills
Office Park LLC v. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, 477 F. Supp. 2d 366,
374 (D. Mass. 2007), but this session disagrees with that
conclusion based upon controlling Massachusetts case law, see
M.J.G. Properties, Inc. v. Hurley, 537 N.E.2d 165, 167 (Mass.
App. Ct. 1989) (“[W]e think the proper approach, and one which
is in accord with our cases, is to look at the question of
waiver as a question of fact in light of all the circumstances,
including the existence of the anti[-]waiver clause.”).
                                - 11 -
    Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 12 of 16



App. Ct. 2004) (finding waiver where party “did more than remain

silent”).   Without more, evidence of Barracuda’s inaction and

lack of inquiry as to its rights under the condition is

insufficient to raise a dispute of fact as to whether

Barracuda’s conduct showed a clear, unequivocal intent to waive.

Cf. J.H. Lynch & Sons, Inc. v. Shaw’s Supermarkets, Inc., No. CV

05-12445-JGD, 2008 WL 11388729, at *8 (D. Mass. Feb. 15, 2008)

(finding allegations of waiver sufficient to survive summary

judgment where evidence showed party actively approved payment

agreements despite condition precedent to the contrary).

     Nevertheless, Axis claims Barracuda cannot rely on waiver

to defeat the breach of contract claim under the doctrine of

equitable estoppel, based on Barracuda’s failure to inquire

about whether Fusion was in compliance.      To invoke equitable

estoppel, Axis must establish that Barracuda made a

representation that was intended to induce a course of conduct

by Fusion and that Fusion did reasonably rely on that conduct to

its detriment.   Dunkin’ Donuts Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d at 62

(“Although estoppel can be based on mere silence, that is true

only where there is a duty to speak . . . .”).       Axis, however,

has not shown that Barracuda was duty-bound to inquire whether

Fusion was complying with the condition precedent rather than

remain silent.   Thus, the failure to inquire is not grounds for

equitable estoppel.

     C. Breach of Covenant

     Finally, Barracuda claims Axis is unable to prove its claim

of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because

it impermissibly seeks to expand Barracuda’s obligations under

the contract.

     Every contract governed under Massachusetts law contains an

implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Ayash v. Dana-

Farber Cancer Inst., 822 N.E.2d 667, 683 (Mass. 2005).         That

covenant reflects an implicit condition that neither party

“shall do anything that will have the effect of destroying or

injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of

the contract.” Galvin v. U.S. Bank Nat. Ass’n, No. CIV.A. 14-

14723, 2015 WL 1014549, at *4 (D. Mass. Mar. 9, 2015) (citing

Anthony’s Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., 583 N.E.2d 806 (Mass.

1991)), aff’d sub nom. Galvin v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 852 F.3d 146

(1st Cir. 2017)).   To show breach of covenant, a plaintiff must

demonstrate that “there existed an enforceable contract between

the two parties” and “the defendant did something that had the

effect of destroying . . . the right of [the plaintiff] to

receive the fruits of the contract.” Laser Labs, Inc. v. ETL

Testing Lab’ys, Inc., 29 F. Supp. 2d 21, 24 (D. Mass. 1998)

(internal quotations omitted).     Thus, the covenant cannot be

used to “create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in

the existing contractual relationship.” Ayash, 822 N.E.2d at 684

                                - 13 -
    Case 1:20-cv-11997-NMG Document 215 Filed 09/09/24 Page 14 of 16



(quotations omitted); see MacKenzie v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 738

F.3d 486, 493 (1st Cir. 2013) (“The concept of good faith is

shaped by the nature of the contractual relationship and the

scope of the covenant is only as broad as the contract . . . .”

(quotations omitted)).

     Allegations that a party breached the covenant of good

faith and fair dealing is “ordinarily a question of fact to be

determined by the jury.”    Wilder v. Toyota Fin. Servs. Americas

Corp., 764 F. Supp. 2d 249, 259 (D. Mass. 2011).        This case,

however, presents an exception.     Because the covenant of good

faith cannot be used to create rights that do not exist in the

contractual relationship, see Ayash, 822 N.E.2d at 684, Axis

must demonstrate some contractual right to which Fusion is

entitled in the event of a data breach.      No evidence of such was

produced during discovery.    As Barracuda articulates, its OEM

agreement with Fusion contains no provision regarding any

actions that must be taken in response to a data breach.4         As

such, Axis cannot rely on an implied duty of good faith to

create a new obligation where one does not exist under the terms

of their agreement.   See Lohnes v. Level 3 Commc’ns, Inc., 272

F.3d 49, 62 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that defendant did not

violate covenant of good faith by failing to provide notice of a


     4  By contrast, Fusion’s agreement with Zoll contains
detailed language concerning such events.

stock split because defendant was “not contractually bound to

provide the appellant with individualized notice of the stock

split”).

     That the breach of covenant claim rests mainly on

Barracuda’s alleged inaction further demonstrates why the claim

cannot survive a motion for summary judgment.       Inaction

constitutes “a lack of good faith . . . only when the

contracting party had a duty to act,” and no such duty exists

under this agreement.    Uno Rests., Inc. v. Bos. Kenmore Realty

Corp., 805 N.E.2d 957, 965 (D. Mass. 2004).       In response, Axis

makes no attempt to refute Barracuda’s argument, and Barracuda
