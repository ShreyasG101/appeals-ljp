outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Diana Avdeeva''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Avdeeva argued that the district court erred in finding that she may not be entitled to prevailing-party status under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA).

  2. Avdeeva contended that, even if she were a prevailing party, the district court erred in concluding that special circumstances would make an award of attorney''s fees unjust.'
