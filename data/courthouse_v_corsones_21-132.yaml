reason_for_appeal: '=== Defendants, administrators and clerks of the Vermont Superior Court''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Defendants argued that the district court erred in holding that Vermont’s pre-access review process for newly filed civil complaints violated Plaintiffs’ First Amendment right of access to judicial documents.

  2. Defendants contended that the district court’s permanent injunction was overbroad and not justified by the evidence or applicable law, as it barred any and all pre-access review before public release of complaints.

  3. Defendants argued that the district court should have abstained from adjudicating the case under principles of comity, equity, and federalism, specifically invoking O’Shea v. Littleton and Younger v. Harris abstention doctrines.

  4. Defendants asserted that the case was moot by the time the district court issued its judgment because Vermont had transitioned to a centralized review model that made 95% of complaints available within one business day, eliminating the alleged unconstitutional delays.

  5. Defendants argued that the district court should have applied intermediate scrutiny, as the pre-access review process constituted a permissible ''time, place, or manner'' restriction rather than being subject to strict scrutiny or the Press-Enterprise II standard.'
