      This appeal arises from a dispute over oil proceeds and a class action

bench trial in Oklahoma. It centered on class-wide violations of Oklahoma’s

Production Revenue Standards Act (PRSA), Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52,

§§ 70.1–570.15. The PRSA imposes strict timeframes on when a “first

purchaser or holder of proceeds” of crude oil from an Oklahoma well must

distribute proceeds to royalty interest or working interest owners entitled

to payments. Cline v. Sunoco, Inc. (R&M), 479 F. Supp. 3d 1148, 1157 (E.D.

Okla. 2020) (Cline II). If the proceeds payments arrive late, the PRSA

mandates that these payments must include statutory interest, at a default

rate of 12 percent. Id.

      The named plaintiff and class representative, Perry Cline, is an

Oklahoma farmer and landowner who owns royalty interests in three

Oklahoma oil wells. Id. at 1159. In 2017, Cline filed a class action lawsuit

against Sunoco, Inc. (R&M), and Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals,

L.P. (collectively, Sunoco). Id. at 1155. He sought to represent all owners

who received late payments from Sunoco without the PRSA-required

interest. Id. Under the PRSA, an “[o]wner” is “a person or governmental

entity with a legal interest in the mineral acreage under a well which

entitles that person or entity to oil or gas production or the proceeds or

revenues therefrom[.]” Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, § 570.2. The class definition

setting forth the members of the class included all “owners” of mineral

interests who received late payments from Sunoco. See Cline v. Sunoco, Inc.

(R&M), 333 F.R.D. 676, 681–82 (E.D. Okla. 2019) (Cline I) (defining the

certified class); see id. at 681 n.1 (discussing class definition).

      In 2019, the district court certified this class. Relevant to this appeal,

Cline’s lawsuit asserted two state law claims for relief: violation of the

PRSA and common law fraud. Id. at 681.

      In 2020, after a four-day bench trial, the district court ruled for the

Class on the PRSA claim and for Sunoco on the fraud claim. The Class of

over 53,000 owners was awarded damages for over $1.5 million late

proceeds payments that failed to include the 12 percent rate of interest.

                                        3
   Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 4



Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1164, 1176–77. The judgment totaled over $103

million in actual damages (which included additional prejudgment interest

that accrued post-trial) and $75 million in punitive damages.

      Before this appeal, Sunoco filed a string of appeals that we dismissed.

We accepted Sunoco’s last appeal preceding this one, however, because the

district court’s initial allocation of damages failed to provide adequate

instructions regarding two undivided accounts for owners whom Sunoco

could not locate. Cline v. Sunoco, Inc. (R&M), No. 22-7018, 2023 WL

4946312, at *6–8 (10th Cir. Aug. 3, 2023) (Cline III). On remand, the district

court corrected those issues in an amended plan of allocation order and an

updated damages order. Together, these orders instructed the settlement

administrator regarding the amount of damages to pay each class member,

including class members who could not be identified and whose payments

were sent to state unclaimed property funds.

     After finalizing the total damages awarded to the Class, the district

court entered final judgment. We therefore have jurisdiction under 28

U.S.C. § 1291. We affirm much of the district court’s findings and rulings,

however, we reverse on one issue, punitive damages.

                                       I

      We begin by discussing the PRSA, including its text, legislative

history, and application to Sunoco. We then discuss this case’s procedural

history as it informs the issues raised on appeal.

                                       A

      The Oklahoma Legislature enacted the PRSA in 1980 to “regulate[]

the marketing, sale, and production of hydrocarbons from Oklahoma wells.”

H.B. Krug v. Helmerich & Payne, Inc., 362 P.3d 205, 211 (Okla. 2015). The

PRSA “generally applies to all owners and all producing wells in Oklahoma

with certain exceptions[,]” defining the duties and requirements for

“proceed sharing” and “royalty disbursement” to those who own interests in

such wells. Id.

      The PRSA was passed to stop the industry practice of delaying

proceeds payments from the sale of oil and gas to royalty owners. See id. at

214. Originally, the PRSA’s 12 percent statutory interest rate for late

payments was punitive. But in 1985, the Oklahoma Legislature “removed

the phrase ‘as a penalty’ from the statute[.]” Purcell v. Santa Fe Mins., Inc.,

961 P.2d 188, 193 (Okla. 1998). That means the PRSA is no longer a

punitive statute, and the 12 percent interest rate is held to be

“incorporate[d] . . . into the contractual arrangements” among the parties.

Id. at 194. “The obvious overriding purpose of the [PRSA] is to ensure that

                                       5
   Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 6



royalty owners are timely paid their share of the proceeds.” H.B. Krug, 362

P.3d at 214. And when interpreting the PRSA, the Oklahoma “Legislature

has followed a path of strengthening mineral owners[’] rights since the Act’s

inception.” Id.

      The PRSA sets forth a specific timetable of when proceeds payments

to owners must occur: within six months from the date of the first sale and

within two months of any subsequent sales. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52,

§ 570.10(B)(1). Subject to a marketable title exception – an exception that

allows a delay or suspension in proceeds payments if there is a legitimate

question over an owner’s marketable title, see Base v. Devon Energy Prod.

Co., 563 P.3d 934, 954 (Okla. 2024) – statutory interest must be added to

any late proceeds payment. § 570.10(D)(1). Relevant here, the statutory

interest rate is 12 percent or, if marketable title is legitimately in question,

6 percent for payments before 2018 (and a lower rate after 2018).

§ 570.10(D)(2). This statutory interest “shall” be “compounded annually . . .

until the day paid.” § 570.10(D)(1). In other words, the PRSA sets a default

12 percent interest rate subject to the marketable title exception:

      D.1. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2[,] . . . that
      portion not timely paid shall earn interest at the rate of twelve
      percent (12%) per annum to be compounded annually, calculated
      from the end of the month in which such production is sold until
      the day paid.



                                       6
   Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 7



            2.a. Where such proceeds are not paid because the title
            thereto is not marketable, such proceeds shall earn
            interest at the rate of (i) six percent (6%) per annum[.]

§ 570.10(D)(1), (2)(a) (emphases added).

     Although the PRSA applies to both crude oil and natural gas wells in

Oklahoma, this case involves only the purchase of oil. Sunoco buys oil

extracted from Oklahoma wells, making it a “first purchaser” under the

PRSA, but “Sunoco is not itself an oil and gas producer and does not have

leases with individual landowners.” Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1157–58.

Instead, the “‘operators’ typically extract the oil from the ground and,

pursuant to contracts, convey it to Sunoco. Sunoco then pays owners their




                                       7
   Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 8



proceeds directly.” 1 Id. at 1158–59 (footnote omitted). In addition, Sunoco

signs contracts with thousands of oil producers in Oklahoma to purchase

their oil, and it “has paid over 100,000 well owners royalty proceeds for oil

and gas production from over 20,000 properties since 2006.” Cline I, 333

F.R.D. at 681.




     1  Numerous players are involved, including royalty owners (like
Cline), working interest owners, operators, and first purchasers (like
Sunoco), among others:
     Oil production has a cast of varied characters. When someone
     (such as Cline) owns land that may have oil on it, an exploration
     and production (“E&P”) company leases the land to drill for and
     extract the oil. The E&P company agrees to split the proceeds from
     the sale of that oil with the landowner if the company can extract
     it. Usually, the landowner gets at least a one-eighth royalty and
     bears no costs or risk associated with drilling the well or cleaning
     and closing a dry hole. The E&P company partners with other
     industry players, known as working interest owners, to drill the
     well, and they split the remaining interest. One of the working
     interest owners is deemed the “operator.” The operator “frequently
     ha[s] either a majority interest, or [it is] elected because [it is]
     knowledgeable and the other working interest owners respect [it].”
     The working interest owner with the largest share of the interest
     performs and coordinates the work, with the remaining companies
     sharing in the cost and risk. After the working interest owners
     extract the oil, companies such as Sunoco will enter into contracts
     with the operators to transport and market the oil. The
     landowner’s interest may fracture over time, such as when a
     landowner dies or sells the interest to another individual or entity.
     Thus, it is not unusual for Sunoco to pay anywhere from tens to
     thousands of interest owners for oil produced from a well.

                                       B

      Cline filed this lawsuit against Sunoco in Oklahoma state court in

2017. Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1155. Sunoco removed the lawsuit to the

United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. Id. “The

case moved along slowly” until June 2019, when Cline moved for class

certification. Id. Cline argued that because Sunoco uniformly failed to pay

the statutory interest it owed under the PRSA on late proceeds payments

for all wells in Oklahoma, the Class should be certified based on Sunoco’s

uniform duty and breach under the PRSA to all 53,000 class members. See

id. at 1155–56. The district court granted class certification in October

2019, citing four common questions in support:

      (1)   whether, under Oklahoma law, Sunoco owed interest to Plaintiff
            and the Class on any and all Untimely Payments;

      (2)   whether owners must make a demand prior to being entitled to
            receive statutory interest;

      (3)   whether Sunoco’s failure to pay interest to Plaintiff and the
            putative class on any Untimely Payments constitutes a violation
            of the PRSA; and

      (4)   whether Sunoco defrauded Plaintiff and the putative class by
            knowingly withholding statutory interest [as applied to Count
            II (fraud) of the original petition].

Cline I, 333 F.R.D. at 683 (alteration in original).

      On October 3, 2019, the district court certified both the PRSA claim

and the fraud claim. Id. at 681, 688. In the class certification decision, the

                                       9
  Appellate Case: 23-7090    Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 10



district court rigorously analyzed each of the factors in Federal Rule of Civil

Procedure 23. Id. at 682–88. The testimony and damages model of Cline’s

expert, Barbara Ley, “establish[ed] that Cline [could] identify the putative

class members and calculate damages class-wide with common proof.” Id.

at 681 n.3. Citing our decision in Naylor Farms, Inc. v. Chaparral Energy,

LLC, 923 F.3d 779, 798 (10th Cir. 2019), the district court advised that it

could “later divide the class into subclasses to determine damages, or amend

or alter its class certification order, if necessary.” Cline I, 333 F.R.D. at 686

n.9.

       Regarding class certification of the fraud claim, Sunoco argued that

individualized questions on each owner’s reliance on Sunoco’s statements

precluded class certification. Id. at 686. But as the district court explained,

“[c]ourts will certify fraud claims . . . when the law of one state applies to

the majority of the claims and the check stubs sent to royalty owners

‘presented . . . a standardized, written representation.’” Id. at 687 (quoting

Rhea v. Apache Corp., No. CIV-14-0433-JH, 2019 WL 1548909, at *9 (E.D.

Okla. Feb. 15, 2019)). And it held that Cline could “establish fraud through

the check stubs Sunoco issued uniformly to the putative class members.” Id.

       Sunoco also claimed that not all members of the Class could be

identified, and thus were not ascertainable. But the Class’s damages “model

provides   a   reliable     and   administratively   feasible   mechanism     for

                                        10
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1      Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 11



determining class membership.” Id. at 688. Ultimately, using the revised

class definition set forth in Cline’s reply brief, the district court granted

class certification, 2 defining the Class as:

      All non-excluded persons or entities who: (1) received Untimely
      Payments from Defendants (or Defendants’ designees) for oil
      proceeds from Oklahoma wells and (2) who have not already
      been paid statutory interest on the Untimely Payments. An
      “Untimely Payment” for purposes of this class definition means
      payment of proceeds from the sale of oil production from an oil
      and gas well after the statutory periods identified in O[kla].
      S[tat]. tit 52, § 570.10(B)(1) (i.e., commencing not later than six
      (6) months after the date of first sale, and thereafter not later
      than the last day of the second succeeding month after the end
      of the month within which such production is sold). Untimely
      Payments do not include: (a) payments of proceeds to an owner
      under O[kla]. S[tat]. tit 52, § 570.10(B)(3) (minimum pay); (b)
      prior period adjustments; or (c) pass-through payments.

Id. at 681–82 (alterations in original).

      Pointing to the two years the case had languished, the district court

set the discovery cutoff as October 18, 2019, and the trial date as December

16, 2019. Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1156.

      On December 10, 2019, the district court granted the Class’s partial

motion for summary judgment on class-wide liability for the PRSA claim. It

held that the PRSA requires Sunoco to include statutory interest



      2  Cline’s “revisions provide[d] a more narrow and manageable
definition[.]” Cline I, 333 F.R.D. at 681 n.4. Because of a statute of
limitations argument, the class definition was limited to a five-year period
of late payments. Id. at 687.

                                       11
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 12



automatically every time it makes a late proceeds payment. Sunoco had

admitted that it did not add interest to late payments unless specifically

requested, which seldom happened. Class-wide partial summary judgment

established Sunoco’s liability under the PRSA to every class member.

      On December 16, 2019, the Class proceeded to a class action bench

trial on both claims for relief. The trial established that Sunoco was already

making proceeds payments to the members of the Class. Sunoco’s corporate

representative, Eric Koelling, agreed that Sunoco had “already sent”

“principal proceeds owed to every class member directly, or to an unclaimed

property fund[,]” and that “there is no issue” that each class member had “a

right to be paid their principal proceeds[.]” Aple. App. IV at 18.

      The Class also offered a class-wide damages expert and damages

model to prove that the actual damages owed can be – and, in fact, already

have been – allocated to each class member:

      To prove the precise amount due, Cline relied on the expert
      testimony of Barbara Ley, a certified public accountant who has
      extensive experience with accounting in the oil and gas
      industry. Ley testified credibly, and described a thorough and
      defensible method of calculating the amount due from Sunoco.
      Ley received information from Sunoco to create a database of
      individual owner information and to determine whether each
      payment was late based on that data. Sunoco’s data identifies
      the date proceeds were sold, the date Sunoco paid proceeds to
      an owner, and the amount of the proceeds. To the extent she
      could, Ley checked the sale date against public records. She also
      reviewed depositions and other documents produced in the case,
      and was present in the courtroom during the majority of the

                                      12
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 13



      trial. Sunoco agrees that Ley’s data reliably reflects the sale
      date, payment date, and amount of proceeds.

Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1161 (citations omitted).

      In August 2020, the district court struck Sunoco’s damages expert,

Eric Krause. His report was untimely and, according to the district court,

not helpful because it rested upon faulty assumptions. Id. at 1165–68.

Sunoco does not appeal these rulings. During the bench trial, Sunoco relied

exclusively upon the testimony of Krause to challenge Ley and to attack the

Class’s damages. So, with Krause struck as an expert, Sunoco ultimately

defended the class action trial with liability already entered class-wide on

the PRSA claim, no damages expert, no damages model, no challenge to

Ley’s expert damages testimony, and no challenge to Ley’s damages model.

      On appeal, Sunoco criticizes at length the district court’s change of

the trial date and the discovery cutoff date. Sunoco, however, does not

actually appeal any of the discovery deadlines, the case scheduling order,

or the trial date. And the district court made unchallenged, specific factual

findings in its trial opinion when it struck Sunoco’s damages expert, id. at

1167–68, and dismantled Sunoco’s critique of the scheduling order, id. at

1164. Despite Sunoco blaming the outcome of this case on a “rogue” district

court, Sunoco did not file a motion to amend the scheduling order, discovery

cutoff date, or trial date. Op. Br. at 57.

  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 14



      Also left unchallenged are the district court’s findings that Sunoco

and its counsel engaged in litigation obstruction. The district court found

that “[w]hen it became clear that the case would move forward, Sunoco

adopted a number of tactics to derail the litigation.” Cline II, 479 F. Supp.

3d at 1156. Sunoco’s tactics included (1) “sending Cline an unrequested

check for the amount of interest it owed him, and then, nearly two years

later, claim[ing] that the tendered check deprived him of standing[,]” (2)

filing a baseless motion to clarify the class definition that “merely amounted

to an argument to cut down the size of the class[,]” and (3) “after the [c]ourt

certified the class (and long after the [c]ourt set a trial date and discovery

cutoff),” waiting “to look through thousands of files for evidence of what it

might owe.” Id. at 1156–57.

      According to the district court, Sunoco’s delays in producing relevant

documents resulted in an untimely and prejudicial “production of millions

of lines of data to the plaintiff – after the plaintiff’s expert report was due,

and after the discovery cutoff.” Id. at 1156. The district court found that

“Sunoco characterizes its search for data as heroic; in reality, Sunoco

ignored its files for years because it never intended to pay much interest,

together.” Id.

     Before this appeal, Sunoco filed a string of appeals that we dismissed

for lack of jurisdiction. In 2023, however, we agreed with Sunoco’s latest

appeal preceding this one and reversed the district court’s damages

allocation order. Cline III, 2023 WL 4946312, at *6-7. We held that

“although the allocation plan provides a formula that will produce

individual damage awards for most class members, it will not produce such

awards for the group of class members associated with the two undivided

accounts.” Id. at *6. These undivided accounts held the damages awards for

class members who could not be identified and located. On remand, the

district court issued an amended plan of allocation order that addressed our

concerns. Notably, in this appeal, Sunoco does not challenge the amended

allocation award.

     After resolving post-trial motions, in October 2023, the district court

entered an amended award of damages that updated the actual damages

awarded to $103,873,002.50. These increased actual damages included the

compounded, prejudgment interest that had continued to accrue post-trial.

     Final judgment was entered on October 19, 2023, and Sunoco timely

appealed.

state property funds because Sunoco’s records were insufficient to locate

them, (3) the prejudgment interest awarded as actual damages to the class,

and (4) the punitive damages awarded to the Class. We affirm the district

court on the first three issues, but we vacate the punitive damages award.

                                      A

      We start with Sunoco’s challenge to the class certification order. We

review de novo whether a district court applied the proper legal standard to

decide a motion for class certification. Black v. Occidental Petroleum Corp.,

69 F.4th 1161, 1173 (10th Cir. 2023). In this case, because the district court

rigorously applied each of the Rule 23(a) and (b)(3) factors, our review of

the decision granting class certification “is highly deferential.” Naylor

Farms, 923 F.3d at 790–91. We may reverse only for an abuse of discretion,

which means that we “must defer to the district court’s ruling unless” the

class certification “decision falls outside the bounds of rationally available

choices given the facts and law involved in the matter at hand.” Id. at 791

(internal quotation marks omitted).

      Class actions in federal court are controlled by Federal Rule of Civil

Procedure 23. There are four Rule 23(a) factors that all class actions must

satisfy, and, in a case seeking damages under Rule 23(b)(3), two additional

factors must be met: predominance and superiority. Amgen Inc. v.

Connecticut Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, 568 U.S. 455, 460 (2013).

                                      16
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 17



      The four Rule 23(a) factors are:

      1. [Numerosity:] the class is so numerous that joinder of all members
         is impracticable; 3

      2. [Commonality:] there are questions of law or fact common to the
         class; 4

      3. [Typicality:] the claims or defenses of the representative parties
         are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; 5 and

      4. [Adequacy:] the representative parties will fairly and adequately
         protect the interests of the class. 6


      3 No set threshold exists for the number of class members needed to

meet the numerosity factor. Usually, a total of 40 or more class members
“raises a presumption of impracticability of joinder based on numbers
alone.” 1 Newberg and Rubenstein on Class Actions § 3:12 (6th ed. 2025).

      4 “A finding of commonality requires only a single question of law or

fact common to the entire class.” Menocal v. GEO Grp., Inc., 882 F.3d 905,
914 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d
1188, 1195 (10th Cir. 2010)); see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564
U.S. 338, 359 (2011) (“We quite agree that for purposes of Rule 23(a)(2) even
a single common question will do.”) (brackets and internal quotation marks
omitted)).

      5 Typicality looks only to confirm that the legal claims for relief are

similar; factual variations among the class members do not defeat
typicality. Menocal, 882 F.3d at 914.

      6 Under Rule 23(a)(4), “[o]nly a conflict that goes to the very subject

matter of the litigation will defeat a party’s claim of representative status.”
Tennille v. W. Union Co., 785 F.3d 422, 430 (10th Cir. 2015) (internal
quotation marks omitted). Likewise, Sunoco alleges without support the
possibility of intra-class conflicts based on some class members having
indemnity agreements, but a “merely speculative or hypothetical” conflict
will not defeat the adequacy requirement. Ward v. Dixie Nat’l Life Ins. Co.,
595 F.3d 164, 180 (4th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).

      A class action seeking damages must also satisfy Rule 23(b)(3), 7 which

requires a plaintiff to show predominance and superiority. Rule 23(b)(3)

states that predominance is satisfied if “the court finds that the questions

of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions

affecting only individual members,” and superiority is met if a “class action

is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating

the controversy.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (emphases added). 8

      In   challenging      class   certification,   Sunoco     contends     that

(1) individualized issues on each owner’s marketable title overwhelm the

common issues so predominance is not met, (2) the class members are not

ascertainable because not all of them can be identified from Sunoco’s




      7 In contrast to a Rule 23(b)(3) class action for damages, a class action

for injunctive relief is pursued under Rule 23(b)(2), and it does not require
predominance or superiority. A plaintiff is allowed to pursue in the same
case both injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) and damages under Rule
23(b)(3). See, e.g., Chicago Tchrs Union, Loc. No. 1 v. Bd. of Educ. of City of
Chicago, 797 F.3d 426, 443 (7th Cir. 2015).

      8 The factors to assess superiority include, but are not limited to:
“(A) the class members’ interests in individually controlling the prosecution
or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation
concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;
(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the
claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a
class action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(A)–(D).

records, and (3) several unidentified class members lack standing so the

class should not have been certified. We address these challenges in turn.

                                      1

      Challenging whether the Class met predominance, Sunoco argues

that the class is not cohesive and there are too many individualized issues

to warrant class certification. See Op. Br. at 34 (“There is simply no way to

adjudicate on a classwide basis claims dependent on the individualized

land-ownership details of each plaintiff.”).

      “The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed

classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.”

Menocal v. GEO Grp., Inc., 882 F.3d 905, 914 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting

Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623 (1997)). To apply the

predominance factor at class certification, “the district court must

determine ‘whether the common, aggregation-enabling, issues in the case

are more prevalent or important than the non-common, aggregation-

defeating, individual issues.’” Sherman v. Trinity Teen Sols., Inc., 84 F.4th

1182, 1194 (10th Cir. 2023) (quoting Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, 577

U.S. 442, 453 (2016)). This means a district court first “should ‘characterize

the issues in the case as common or not, and then weigh which issues

predominate.’” Black, 69 F.4th at 1175 (quoting CGC Holding Co., LLC v.

Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076, 1087 (10th Cir. 2014)). As we have

emphasized, “[i]t is not necessary that all” the “elements of the claim entail

questions of fact and law that are common to the class.” Id. (quoting CGC

Holding Co., 773 F.3d at 1087).

      The predominance inquiry “begins ‘with the elements of the

underlying cause of action.’” Id. (quoting CGC Holding Co., 773 F.3d at

1088). In this case, the district court certified claims for violation of the

PRSA and common law fraud. The elements of a PRSA violation claim have

not been affirmatively stated in a published opinion by an Oklahoma

appellate court, but we must construe the PRSA claim here as a breach of

contract claim. See Purcell, 961 P.2d at 193. A breach of contract claim

under Oklahoma law requires “(1) formation of a contract; (2) breach of the

contract; and (3) damages as a result of that breach.” Morgan v. State Farm

Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 488 P.3d 743, 748 (Okla. 2021); accord Cline I, 333

F.R.D. at 684 (“To succeed on his PRSA claims, Cline must show that

Sunoco (1) owed Cline payments; (2) made the payments to Cline late; and

(3) did not pay the interest on the late payments.” (citing Chieftain Royalty

Co. v. Marathon Oil Co., No. CIV-17-334-SPS, 2018 WL 2745906, at *2 (E.D.

Okla. June 7, 2018))).

      Regarding the fraud claim, “fraud is a generic term embracing the

multifarious means which human ingenuity can devise so one can get

advantage over another by false suggestion or suppression of the truth.”

                                      20

Croslin v. Enerlex, Inc., 308 P.3d 1041, 1045 (Okla. 2013). The district court

did not identify which type or form of fraud it interpreted Cline’s fraud

claim to be alleging. Oklahoma recognizes two forms of fraud – actual and

constructive – along with similar claims for relief that could apply, such as

deceit by nondisclosure. “Actual fraud is the intentional misrepresentation

or concealment of a material fact, with an intent to deceive, which

substantially affects another person[.]” Id. (footnote omitted). And

“constructive fraud,” which “has the same legal consequence as actual

fraud[,]” “is a breach of a legal or equitable duty to the detriment of another,

which does not necessarily involve any moral guilt, intent to deceive, or

actual dishonesty of purpose.” Id. at 1045–46.

      In line with Oklahoma law on both the PRSA claim and the fraud

claim, the district court identified four common and predominant questions

that would determine class-wide liability against Sunoco as a matter of law.

Cline I, 333 F.R.D. at 683. As Cline argued in seeking class certification,

“Sunoco’s business records and employee testimony will confirm its ‘uniform

policy of not paying statutory interest unless requested by an owner.’” Id.

Cline pointed out “that the proposed class will use common evidence of

Sunoco’s unlawful actions, and that if the Court finds Sunoco had a duty to

pay that interest without a request and Sunoco breached that duty, every

class member will prevail.” Id.

                                      21
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 22



      Predominance hinges on the distinction between common issues and

individual issues. “Common issues are those for which ‘the same evidence

will suffice for each member to make a prima facie showing [or] the issue is

susceptible to generalized, class-wide proof.’” Black, 69 F.4th at 1175

(quoting Tyson Foods, Inc., 577 U.S. at 453) (alteration in original). In

contrast, “[i]ndividual issues are those for which ‘members of [the] proposed

class will need to present evidence that varies from member to member.’”

Id. (quoting Tyson Foods, Inc., 577 U.S. at 453).

      Because of the distinction between common and individualized

evidence, we agree that the Class met the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance

factor. To show predominance, “[i]t is not necessary that all of the elements

of the claim entail questions of fact and law that are common to the class,

nor that the answers to those common questions be dispositive.” CGC

Holding Co., 773 F.3d at 1087. What Rule 23(b)(3) “does require is that

common questions ‘predominate over any questions affecting only

individual [class] members.’” Amgen Inc., 568 U.S. at 469 (quoting Fed. R.

Civ. P. 23(b)(3)). And “Rule 23(b)(3) requires a showing that questions

common to the class predominate, not that those questions will be

answered, on the merits, in favor of the class.” Id. at 459.

      Thus, Rule 23(b)(3) requires predominance, not perfection, such that

“the common, aggregation-enabling, issues in the case are more prevalent

                                      22
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 23



or important than the non-common, aggregation-defeating, individual

issues.” Menocal, 882 F.3d at 914–15 (quoting CGC Holding Co., 773 F.3d

at 1087). “Critically, so long as at least one common issue predominates, a

plaintiff can satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) – even if there remain individual issues,

such as damages, that must be tried separately.” Naylor Farms, 923 F.3d

at 789; accord 7AA C. Wright, A. Miller, M. Kane & R. Klonoff, Federal

Practice & Procedure § 1778 (3d ed. 2025) (“The common questions need not

be dispositive of the entire action. In other words, ‘predominate’ should not

be automatically equated with ‘determinative.’” (footnote omitted)).

      Key aspects of this class action align with several controlling Tenth

Circuit class certification decisions: In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 768 F.3d

1245 (10th Cir. 2014); CGC Holding Co., 773 F.3d 1076; Menocal, 882 F.3d

905; and Naylor Farms, 923 F.3d 779. Across these decisions, we

emphasized three traits that the Class proved were present here: (1) the

defendant used a common or uniform scheme, policy, or practice to target

most of the class (or each sub-class); (2) the empirical proof of a class action

trial confirmed whether predominance actually existed or whether the class

imploded at trial under the force of too many individualized issues; and

(3) the predominating issue of a defendant’s breach outweighed any

individualized issues on damages or other matters.

  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 24



                                      a

     First, we start with the principle that predominance is often satisfied

when a defendant has implemented a class-wide scheme, policy, or

practice. 9 In most of our recent decisions concluding that the predominance

factor was satisfied, we have emphasized the legal significance of this

showing under Rule 23(b)(3):

     • In re Urethane, 768 F.3d at 1258–59 (affirming class-wide jury
       verdict in an antitrust conspiracy case because the defendants’
       price-fixing scheme created a singular, common issue that
       predominated over any individualized issues).

     • CGC Holding Co., 773 F.3d at 1082, 1091 (affirming class
       certification of a civil RICO claim based on the defendants’
       “common scheme to defraud” all investors in a real estate
       investment offering and a generalized inference of reliance).

     • Menocal, 882 F.3d at 920 (affirming class certification based on the
       defendant’s uniform policy to coerce all prisoners in its private
       prison to perform forced labor).

     • Naylor Farms, 923 F.3d at 782–83 (affirming class certification
       because the defendant’s uniform policy of deducting midstream
       services from royalty payments created a singular, class-wide
       issue).



     9 A “scheme” and a “policy” are the same thing; a “scheme” is a “policy”

that harms the plaintiffs, often by deception or foul play. A “practice” is
included to illustrate that even if a defendant denies having a business
policy or avoids reducing its business policy to writing, a “practice”
functions as a de facto “scheme” or “policy.” See, e.g., Aplt. App. II at 55
(negating Sunoco’s assertion that it did not have a “policy” and merely
engaged in a “practice” to not pay interest it owed without receiving a
demand). These three terms function the same way, and we use them
interchangeably.

      When a class action targets a defendant’s class-wide policy or practice,

the focus at trial necessarily is on the defendant and the common evidence

in its documents and business records – not on individual issues that

require the individualized testimony of each class member. And as this case

confirms, the “predominant question” of a defendant’s class-wide liability

will, in many cases, “definitively end the litigation.” CGC Holding Co., 773

F.3d at 1093 n.11.

      The Class successfully demonstrated that Sunoco “engaged in an

ongoing scheme to avoid making the required interest payments” by not

disclosing its duty to pay interest and only paying interest when specifically

requested. Cline I, 333 F.R.D. at 681. Sunoco’s class-wide scheme made

“class-wide proof possible.” Menocal, 882 F.3d at 920. Sunoco’s scheme

allowed the district court to grant partial summary judgment on liability to

the Class – a class-wide, dispositive ruling for all 53,000 class members that

Sunoco does not appeal. To be clear, Sunoco does not appeal the ruling of

class-wide liability, only the amount of interest (which, in this case,

constitutes the actual damages) it owes to each of the 53,000 members of

the Class. Thus, Sunoco’s class-wide scheme supplies “the ‘glue’ that holds

together” the Class’s claim that Sunoco violated the PRSA and owes

statutory interest to every class member. See Menocal, 882 F.3d at 920

(quoting Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 352 (2011)). We thus

                                      25
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 26



affirm the unchallenged factual findings that “[t]he trial testimony

established that Sunoco followed a practice of not paying interest until it

received a request from an owner[;]” that “Ley created a methodology

through which she could calculate class-wide damages based on that

conduct[;]” and that Ley’s “computer calculations identify the precise

damages for each late payment for each owner of each well.” Cline II, 479

F. Supp. 3d at 1164.

     Sunoco primarily relies on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes to argue

that class certification was improper. But Wal-Mart is less valuable in a

Rule 23(b)(3) damages case than Sunoco contends. See Menocal, 882 F.3d at

920 n.10 (explaining the limited utility of Wal-Mart in a damages class

action involving a corporate policy that unifies the class). The Wal-Mart

plaintiffs alleged “that the discretion exercised by their local supervisors

over pay and promotion matters” violated Title VII by discriminating

against women. Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 342. The Ninth Circuit in Wal-Mart

had approved class certification of “one of the most expansive class actions

ever[,]” with a decade-long class period and 1.5 million current and former




                                      26

female employees in all of Wal-Mart’s 3,400 stores across America. Id. 10 The

Supreme Court reversed the order granting class certification, ruling that

the plaintiffs had not established commonality because the employment

decisions complained of resulted from millions of individual decisions made

by low-level decision-makers who had total, subjective discretion over such

matters. Id. at 359–60. As a result of these outlier facts, the class members

“wish[ed] to sue about literally millions of employment decisions at once[,]”

but the class could not be certified “[w]ithout some glue holding the alleged

reasons for all those decisions together[.]” Id. at 352; see also id. at 359

(finding no commonality absent “convincing proof of a companywide

discriminatory pay and promotion policy”).

     But Wal-Mart involved outlier facts, and the class sought nationwide

injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2). Given the fact pattern, even the

dissenting Justices agreed that class certification for injunctive relief was

improper under Rule 23(b)(2). 11 The plaintiffs did not target a corporate


     10 These plaintiffs “held a multitude of jobs, at different levels of Wal–

Mart's hierarchy, for variable lengths of time, in 3,400 stores, sprinkled
across 50 states, with a kaleidoscope of supervisors (male and female),
subject to a variety of regional policies that all differed[.]” Wal-Mart, 564
U.S. at 359–60 (internal quotation marks omitted).

     11 See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 367 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting in part and

concurring in part) (“The class in this case, I agree with the Court, should
not have been certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).”).

                                      27

policy or a series of corporate policies, 12 but rather sought to challenge

“literally millions of employment decisions at once.” Id. at 352.

       Those concerns, however, are wholly absent here. Sunoco’s uniform,

objective policy not to pay interest was devised at the corporate level by its

executives and legal counsel as a corporate policy or practice (not by

thousands of low-level individual employees). Sunoco’s policy did not

involve thousands of decision-makers scattered across the 50 states.

Equally important, Cline and the Class did not seek injunctive relief under

Rule 23(b)(2). As the Wal-Mart majority clarified, “[t]he applicability” of the

language in Rule 23(b)(3) on predominance was “not before [the Court].” Id.

at 346 n.2.

       The class certification in this case involved a uniform corporate policy

and a damages class action pursued under Rule 23(b)(3). Both wide-scale

exercise of independent discretion and the Rule 23(b)(2) concerns in Wal-

Mart are absent. And Rule 23(b)(3) “allows class certification in a much

wider set of circumstances but with greater procedural protections.” Id. at

362.




       12See id. at 355 (“The only corporate policy that the plaintiffs’
evidence convincingly establishes is Wal–Mart’s ‘policy’ of allowing
discretion by local supervisors over employment matters.”).

      Next, we recognize the significance that this class action proceeded to

a bench trial and that the allocation of individual damages awards to each

of the 53,000 class members is unchallenged. That damages could be – in

fact, already were – individually allocated to each of the 53,000 class

members proves the Class satisfied the predominance factor. The amended

allocation order, which states precisely how much is awarded individually

to each class member, is not at issue on appeal.

      Typically, our review of class certification is at the Rule 23(f) stage,

before summary judgment and long before trial. But here, we do not have

to predict whether the common issues of Sunoco’s liability will predominate

– “we know from the actual trial” that they in fact did. In re Urethane, 768

F.3d at 1258–59 (affirming class action trial aggregate damages award

totaling nearly $1 billion for antitrust violations). Indeed, “the district court

had the benefit of seeing what ultimately took place at trial. The court had

no need to make a prediction based on the expert report. Instead, the

district court could see that common issues of liability had predominated

over individualized issues.” Id. at 1259.

      With the proof generated by the class action trial transcript, the

district court’s findings disproved Sunoco’s challenges to predominance:

“The trial testimony established that Sunoco followed a practice of not

                                       29

paying interest until it received a request from an owner. Ley created a

methodology through which she could calculate class-wide damages based

on that conduct.” Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1164 (citations omitted).

“Further, her computer calculations identify the precise damages for each

late payment for each owner of each well.” Id. We see no reason to disturb

the district court’s findings.

                                      c

      Additionally, we conclude that the predominating issue of Sunoco’s

liability outweighed any individualized issues on damages or other matters.

This case aligns with our decision in Naylor Farms, a royalty underpayment

class action pursued under Oklahoma law. As to our federal class action

standards, we explained that, “[c]ritically, so long as at least one common

issue predominates, a plaintiff can satisfy Rule 23(b)(3) – even if there

remain individual issues, such as damages, that must be tried separately.”

Naylor Farms, 923 F.3d at 789.

      Our review of class certification in Naylor Farms was at the Rule 23(f)

stage, so we had to predict what issues would predominate at trial. 13 That



      13 Naylor Farms, 923 F.3d at 798 (stating at the Rule 23(f) stage,
before trial, that “[w]e see no indication” that individualized issues
overwhelming the common issue “will occur here” later at trial). But in this
case, with the trial concluded and damages allocated to the Class members,
we know with certainty that no individualized issues predominated.

                                      30
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 31



case involved a class of royalty owners who alleged they were charged excess

deductions for midstream services applied to natural gas produced from

Oklahoma wells in which they had royalty interests. Id. The defendant

insisted that the variations among gas quality and different lease language

made it impossible to certify a cohesive class. Id. at 795–96. Similarly,

Sunoco here insists there are individualized variations regarding the timing

of the interest payments and each owner’s marketable title among the

Class.

     We rejected the defendant’s argument in Naylor Farms, explaining

that a single common issue (the defendant’s class-wide breach of lease to

each class member) predominated, and that all the defendant’s alleged

individualized issues were “relevant only to the post-breach question of

damages.” Id. at 790. We reject Sunoco’s argument on the same grounds.

And because the class plaintiffs in Naylor Farms “provided evidence that

[their] expert [could] determine damages on a class[-]wide basis through

use of a model,” we affirmed the district court’s ruling that “these

distinctions don’t defeat predominance.” Id. (internal quotation marks

omitted). We highlighted that the defendant failed to identify any “specific”

evidence that showed any actual lease language variations that would

create genuine individualized issues and make a class action trial

unworkable. Id. at 797. All this analysis applies with full force here, and

                                      31
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 32



even more so, given that Sunoco’s only identified expert on class

certification and damages – Krause – was struck (and independently

deemed unreliable as an expert).

      Sunoco relies on our decision reversing class certification in Wallace

B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust v. XTO Energy, Inc., 725 F.3d 1213 (10th

Cir. 2013). That case, like Naylor Farms, involved alleged royalty

underpayments that depended on the language in hundreds of individual

leases, but our ruling there was largely driven by the class plaintiffs’ basic

failure to even review all the leases. See id. at 1219 (“[T]here are roughly

430 leases which have yet to be examined[.]”). We did not suggest that the

class could never be certified as a matter of law; rather, we said that “[o]n

remand” the class plaintiffs “could, for example, create a chart classifying

lease types” so that the district court could determine whether the lease

language variations were too individualized. Id.; see also Naylor Farms, 923

F.3d at 795–96 (distinguishing Roderick because the royalty owner class

plaintiffs created a “generally accurate” lease chart, doing exactly as we

suggested in Roderick (internal quotation marks omitted)).

     As Sunoco argues, we also suggested in Roderick that on remand the

district court needed to assess “the extent to which material differences in

damages determinations will require individualized inquiries.” Roderick,



                                      32
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 33



725 F.3d at 1220. But we continued: “That said, there are ways to preserve

the class action model in the face of individualized damages.” Id.

      As a matter of law, individualized damages in class actions typically

do not defeat predominance under Rule 23(b)(3). “[T]he black letter rule is

that individual damage calculations generally do not defeat a finding that

common issues predominate, and courts in every circuit have uniformly held

that the 23(b)(3) predominance requirement is satisfied despite the need to

make individualized damage determinations.” Brayman v. KeyPoint Gov’t

Sols., Inc., 83 F.4th 823, 839 (10th Cir. 2023) (quoting 2 Newberg and

Rubenstein on Class Actions § 4:55); see also Menocal, 882 F.3d at 922

(same).

      Sunoco   primarily    challenges     predominance    by   claiming    that

individualized questions on marketable title (which went only to the

amount of damages owed) overwhelmed the common questions on liability.

But Sunoco fails to confront the district court’s analysis on marketable title

or show any legal error.

      Because this case is in federal court based on federal diversity

jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), 14 “we apply the



      14 Sunoco removed this case to federal court under the Class Action

Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), a sub-section of the diversity jurisdiction
statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1332. See § 1332(d)(2).

substantive law of the forum state – Oklahoma.” Shotts v. GEICO Gen. Ins.

Co., 943 F.3d 1304, 1308 n.4 (10th Cir. 2019). To do so, we “must ascertain

and apply Oklahoma law with the objective that the result obtained in the

federal court should be the result that would be reached in an Oklahoma

court.” Siloam Springs Hotel, L.L.C. v. Century Sur. Co., 906 F.3d 926, 930

(10th Cir. 2018) (quoting Wood v. Eli Lilly & Co., 38 F.3d 510, 512 (10th

Cir. 1994)). Thus, when considering the arguments on marketable title, we

look to Oklahoma law.

      We start by analyzing the factual underpinnings of Sunoco’s

arguments. Sunoco does not address the district court’s findings of fact

regarding Sunoco’s failure to substantiate its marketable title defense. The

district court found that:




                                       34
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 35



      • “Sunoco did not identify a single case in which an owner did not
        have marketable title.” Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1171.

      • “Sunoco has never even bothered to figure out how much interest
        it owes to owners. It keeps scant records of why it made late
        payments.” Id. at 1155.

      • It was only “after the [c]ourt certified the class (and long after the
        [c]ourt set a trial date and discovery cutoff)” that “Sunoco finally
        began to look through thousands of files for evidence of what it
        might owe.” Id. at 1156.

      • “For its millions of late payments, it says it cannot determine the
        amount of interest due. This inability, however, does not arise from
        a lack of information. Rather, it arises from Sunoco’s unwillingness
        to make the effort, at the time of the late payment, to determine
        the cause of the lateness and the amount of interest due.” Id. at
        1160.

      These factual findings undercut Sunoco’s marketable title challenge

on appeal. Under Oklahoma law, doubts regarding marketable title can be

used to suspend or deny proceeds payments to owners “only when a

legitimate question as to marketability of title exist[s.]” Hull v. Sun Refin.

& Mktg. Co., 789 P.2d 1272, 1277 (Okla. 1989). We explored this issue in

Quinlan v. Koch Oil Co., 25 F.3d 936 (10th Cir. 1994), applying Oklahoma

law and rejecting an oil producer’s defense that a royalty owner seeking

relief under the PRSA had to make “a showing of marketable title every

time a royalty payment was due.” Id. at 940. We declined “to read Hull as

broadly as [the defendant] would have us.” Id.




                                      35
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 36



      The parties in this case frame this inquiry as a question of who has

the burden of proof on marketable title. We assume, without deciding, that

generally each royalty owner has the initial burden to establish marketable

title to receive royalty payments under the PRSA, if there are “legitimate

questions” on marketable title. But in this case, Sunoco itself had already

determined that every member of the Class had marketable title, and it is

“implausible that Sunoco paid people money that it did not owe them,

especially considering the company’s policy of withholding interest

payments from their rightful owners in contravention of clear Oklahoma

law.” See Aplt. App. II at 204. Additionally, the definition of the class also

ensured that Sunoco would pay damages only to those owners it had already

determined were entitled to proceeds payments. See id. (“These limitations

– narrowing the class to those who have already received untimely

payments for oil proceeds but have not received the statutory interest

payments – ensure the legal entitlement of each member of the class to

interest payments under the PRSA.”).

      As a result, we “conclude that the marketability of [the Class

members’] title was not legitimately in question[,]” and thus we affirm the

holding that each member of the Class is not obligated “to make an

affirmative showing of marketable title” to prevail against Sunoco, Quinlan,

25 F.3d at 940; accord Base, 563 P.3d at 954 (advising that “it does not

                                      36
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 37



appear that the parties even dispute whether [plaintiffs] have marketable

title, as [the defendant] has been making royalty payments to [them]”).

      In the absence of legitimate questions on marketable title in the first

instance, marketable title became an affirmative defense, which Sunoco

bore the burden to establish. See, e.g., Pioneer Centres Holding Co. Emp.

Stock Ownership Plan & Tr. v. Alerus Fin., N.A., 858 F.3d 1324, 1335 (10th

Cir. 2017); FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 44–45 (1948) (“[T]he burden

of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the

prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits[.]”).

Sunoco pleaded a lack of marketable title as an affirmative defense, and

“the burden of proving all affirmative defenses rests on the defendant.”

Roberts v. Barreras, 484 F.3d 1236, 1241 (10th Cir. 2007). Placing the

impossible burden on each Class member to determine how Sunoco

conducted its internal corporate decision-making on the lack of marketable

title would be both unworkable and unreasonable.

      Sunoco failed to meet its burden to establish a lack of marketable title.

At trial, Sunoco presented Kraettli Epperson “as an expert on marketable

title.” Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1163. But Epperson “did not examine any

titles” and “could not testify that any of the owners did not have marketable

title.” Id. Beyond this, “Epperson did not conduct a title search on property

of any of the 53,000 owners to whom Sunoco made late payments. He offered

                                      37
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 38



no opinion on the state of any titles at issue in this case.” Id. Thus, Sunoco’s

expert was unable to locate a single instance out of over 1.5 million late

payments where legitimate questions on marketable title justified the late

proceeds payment to an owner.

      Finally, Sunoco argues that affirmative defenses are individualized

and defeat class certification. See Reply Br. at 19. But affirmative defenses

rarely defeat class certification, especially where, as here, they target only

the amount of damages owed by a defendant:

      In many circumstances, however, a class that otherwise
      satisfies predominance can be certified even if affirmative
      defenses raise individual questions of law or fact. Courts are
      generally reluctant to deny class action status under Rule
      23(b)(3) simply because affirmative defenses may be available
      against individual members, such that the presence of
      individual defenses does not by its terms preclude class
      certification. Courts in most circuits have adopted some version
      of this approach. This is particularly true given the range of
      procedural mechanisms available to courts to deal with
      potentially individualized affirmative defenses.

thereafter to decline to decertify the Class following the successful class

action trial.

                                      2

      We next address Sunoco’s argument that the members of the class

were not ascertainable. Sunoco says that the Class should not have been

certified because all members of the Class were not identified by name. Op.

Br. at 35–37.

      Rule 23 does not expressly include an ascertainability requirement.

But “most circuits have implemented some version of an ascertainability

test as an implied prerequisite to class certification.” Freund v. McDonough,

114 F.4th 1371, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2024); see also Sandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC

v. Medtox Sci., Inc., 821 F.3d 992, 995 (8th Cir. 2016) (same) (collecting

cases). At class certification, the movant must provide “a sufficiently

definite” class definition, and “[a]ll courts essentially focus on the question

                                      39
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 40



of whether the class can be ascertained by objective criteria.” 1 Newberg

and Rubenstein on Class Actions § 3:3 (6th ed. 2025). “[A]scertainability

requires only that the court be able to identify class members at some stage

of the proceeding.” Freund, 114 F.4th at 1378 (internal quotation marks

omitted).

      In challenging ascertainability, Sunoco argues that we should adopt

the minority view that “administrative feasibility” is a required element of

the test for ascertainability. In support, Sunoco cites Adashunas v. Negley,

626 F.2d 600, 604 (7th Cir. 1980), a Seventh Circuit decision from several

decades ago. 15 Reply Br. at 14. Sunoco contends that class certification

violates the “administrative feasibility” factor because locating class

members will be time-consuming and overly difficult. However, Sunoco

cannot defeat class certification either by failing to keep proper records or

failing to produce them. See Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1171 n.21 (declining

to “allow Sunoco to hide behind a mess of its own making” by failing to keep

proper records).




      15 Not only does this 1980 decision precede the amendments to modern

Rule 23, but it also advises that a court facing an overbroad class definition
should narrow it – not outright deny class certification, and thereby deny
relief to the entire class. See Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co., 571 F.3d 672,
678 (7th Cir. 2009) (citing Adashunas, 626 F.2d at 603-04).

      The record demonstrates that Sunoco failed to gather and produce the

owner information it was statutorily required to maintain under the PRSA.

And gaps in the records kept and produced by a defendant cannot be used

to hinder class certification. See Kelly v. RealPage Inc., 47 F.4th 202, 223

(3d Cir. 2022). It is settled that “where [a defendant’s] lack of records makes

it more difficult to ascertain members of an otherwise objectively verifiable

class, the [individuals] who make up that class should not bear the cost of

the [defendant’s] faulty record keeping.” Id. (alterations in original)

(quoting Hargrove v. Sleepy’s LLC, 974 F.3d 467, 470 (3d Cir. 2020)); 16 see

also Rikos v. Procter & Gamble Co., 799 F.3d 497, 525-26 (6th Cir. 2015)

(advising that ascertaining the class members requires only “reasonable

accuracy” and that class certification is proper even if that “process may

require additional, even substantial, review of files”) (quoting Young, 693

F.3d at 539).




      16 These bracketed alterations in Kelly v. RealPage Inc. expanded the

ruling in Hargrove v. Sleepy’s LLC, 974 F.3d 467 (3d Cir. 2020), which
involved an employer-employee dynamic. In RealPage, the Third Circuit
stated that it is appropriate to “rel[y] on Hargrove outside of the
employment context for the proposition that a defendant’s faulty
recordkeeping will not preclude certification of an otherwise ascertainable
class.” Lewis v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co., 98 F.4th 452, 462 n.13 (3d Cir. 2024)
(citing Kelly v. RealPage Inc., 47 F.4th 202, 223 (3d Cir. 2022)). Thus, these
ascertainability rulings apply to all class actions.

                                      41
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1    Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 42



      Nor can “defendants . . . defeat ascertainability with a strategic

decision to house records across multiple sources or databases.” Kelly, 47

F.4th at 223; Lewis v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co., 98 F.4th 452, 462 & n.13 (3d

Cir. 2024) (explaining that “a straightforward ‘yes-or-no’ review of existing

records to identify class members is administratively feasible even if it

requires review of individual records with cross-referencing of voluminous

data from multiple sources”) (quoting Kelly, 47 F.4th at 224); see also Kelly,

47 F.4th at 223 (A “matching of records is precisely the sort of exercise we

have found sufficiently administrable to satisfy ascertainability in other

cases.”).

      Likewise, a defendant cannot avoid class certification by objecting “to

the number of records that must be individually reviewed,” because that “is

essentially an objection to the size of the class, which . . . explicitly . . . is

not a reason to deny class certification.” Kelly, 47 F.4th at 224; see also

Young, 693 F.3d at 539-40 (same and collecting cases). “To hold otherwise

would be to categorically preclude class actions where defendants

purportedly harmed too many people, which would seriously undermine the

purpose of a class action to vindicate meritorious individual claims in an

efficient manner.” Id. at 225 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed,

“[i]t is often the case that class action litigation grows out of systemic

failures of administration, policy application, or records management that

                                       42
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 43



result in small monetary losses to large numbers of people.” Rikos, 799 F.3d

at 525 (quoting Young, 693 F.3d at 540). And, thus, “[t]o allow that same

systemic failure to defeat class certification would undermine the very

purpose of class action remedies.” Id. at 525–26 (quoting Young, 693 F.3d

at 540).

      At the same time, our circuit has not yet published a decision on

whether ascertainability is a separate class certification factor. 17 It appears

that there is now some uncertainty, which has left some district courts in

this circuit forced to guess about what ascertainability standard to apply.

At least two lower courts in our circuit have predicted that we would adopt




      17 We did state in the 1970s that “[i]n class action suits there must be

presented some evidence of established, ascertainable numbers constituting
the class” to satisfy the numerosity requirement in Rule 23(a)(1). Rex v.
Owens ex rel. State of Okla., 585 F.2d 432, 436 (10th Cir. 1978). But we did
not expand on what that meant, and in the nearly half century since then,
Rule 23 and the corresponding case law on class actions and ascertainability
have evolved significantly (along with the ability to gather and analyze
records electronically, allowing litigants to ascertain in seconds what might
have taken months or years in previous decades).

the Seventh Circuit’s test for ascertainability, which is the majority rule

among our sister circuits. 18

      We join the majority view by adopting the Seventh Circuit’s test for

ascertainability of a class action’s members. We also reject “administrative

feasibility” as an additional required factor. Freund, 114 F.4th at 1378

(quoting Hayes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 725 F.3d 349, 356 (3d Cir. 2013)).

Instead, we “agree with the majority of circuits that there is no basis for

finding a lack of ascertainability because it is difficult to identify the class

members.” Id.; see also id. at 1378 n.6 (collecting cases from the Second,

Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits). Rather, as our sister circuits have

explained, “administrative feasibility may bear on whether class resolution

is superior to individual resolution,” but it should not operate as a trump

card that outweighs all other factors under Rule 23. Id.; see also Davoll v.

Webb, 194 F.3d 1116, 1146 (10th Cir. 1999) (upholding district court’s




      18 In two multi-district litigations involving complex class actions in

exercise of discretion that determining class membership would be

administratively infeasible).

      For class members to be ascertainable, the class definition must (1) be

defined clearly and cannot be defined too vaguely, and (2) be defined

objectively and cannot be based on subjective criteria, such as by a person’s

state of mind. 19 Mullins v. Direct Digit., LLC, 795 F.3d 654, 659–60 (7th Cir.

2015). Again, we “see no reason” to make administrative feasibility a

required element of this test, “particularly given the strong criticism it has

attracted from other courts.” Rikos, 799 F.3d at 525; see also Mullins, 795

F.3d at 662 (same). In contrast, we require the movant seeking class

certification to show that class members can ultimately be identified (i.e.,

they are ascertain-able but not necessarily ascertained at the time of class

certification) using “reasonable – but not perfect – accuracy.” Rikos, 799

F.3d at 526.

      The Class satisfied this ascertainability standard. The district court

made specific fact-findings that the class was objectively defined with a




      19 We again decline to decide whether a “fail-safe” class definition is

an independent bar to class certification because this argument was not
adequately briefed. Sherman v. Trinity Teen Solutions, Inc., 84 F.4th 1181,
1191 n.6 (10th Cir. 2023). A “fail-safe” class is “one that is defined so that
whether a person qualifies as a member depends on whether the person has
a valid claim.” Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d 802,
825 (7th Cir. 2012).

reliable and administratively feasible mechanism for determining class

membership. Cline I, 333 F.R.D. at 688. Sunoco does not challenge these

findings of fact, again failing to point us to an error in the trial proceedings

or district court rulings. Having paid every class member principal proceeds

and deemed its own records sufficient to satisfy its obligations under the

PRSA, Sunoco is not permitted to cast doubt on its own record-keeping to

avoid liability. See Soutter v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, 307 F.R.D. 183,

197–98 (E.D. Va. 2015) (“In general, courts do not look favorably upon the

argument that records a defendant treats as accurate for business purposes

are not accurate enough to define a class.”).

      This is especially true in this case because, as a “first purchaser” of

oil, Sunoco is obligated under the PRSA to keep proper records on the

payments owed and made to owners. Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1172. And

Sunoco does not contest on appeal the district court’s factual findings on

ascertainability or its ability to locate members of the Class. The district

court found:

      Unsurprisingly, Sunoco conflates doing what is impossible with
      doing what is hard. No doubt, figuring out what Sunoco owes to
      interest owners is difficult when it has failed to comply with the
      PRSA for years. Had Sunoco done its homework in the years
      before this suit, it would have known how much interest it owes,
      and could have presented a compilation or summary. See Fed.
      R. Evid. 1006. Sunoco's own evidence shows that it has the
      ability to determine what Sunoco owes interest owners; it just


                                      46
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1      Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 47



      does not do so until asked. Thus, Sunoco's arguments fall far
      short.

Id. at 1164-65. For all these reasons, we affirm the district court’s ruling

that the Class satisfied ascertainability. 20

                                       B

      Sunoco next challenges standing. It contends that a portion of the

Class was not identified by name because Sunoco had only the account

information, not the names for each “flesh and blood” class member. 21 As a




      20 Beyond its challenges to class certification based on predominance

and ascertainability, Sunoco also lists several other class action factors, left
undeveloped as legal arguments, that we decline to review under “the
doctrine of appellate-briefing waiver.” In re Syngenta AG MIR 162 Corn
Litig., 111 F.4th 1095, 1112 (10th Cir. 2024). The mere “[r]ecitation of a tale
of apparent injustice . . . cannot substitute for legal argument.” Id. (internal
quotation marks omitted). Sunoco asserts, for instance, that the district
court violated the Rules Enabling Act and that some class members had
intra-class conflicts based on indemnity agreements. Sunoco also mentions
that determining the date of first-sale as a factual matter defeated the
typicality and adequacy requirements under Rule 23(a)(3) and (4). Before
the district court, it made a similar argument to challenge predominance.
See Aplt. App. I at 202. But even if this argument was not waived as under-
developed on appeal, the district court’s fact-finding, made in reliance upon
the Class’s expert, was not an abuse of discretion.

      21 Sunoco inserted a “flesh and blood” phrase or argument for the first

time in its reply brief, no less than six times. Reply Br. at 6, 7, 12, 16, 22,
23. But it does not adequately explain the meaning of that phrase nor
provide a citation for any authority that would give this phrase legal
significance to this case.

result, Sunoco argues that the entire class action failed for lack of standing.

We disagree.

      To establish standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate that they

(1) “ha[ve] suffered or likely will suffer an injury in fact,” (2) “the injury

likely was caused or will be caused by the defendant,” and (3) “the injury

likely would be redressed by the requested judicial relief.” Food & Drug

Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024). The Class met

all three factors. Sunoco underpaid every class member by failing to

automatically pay interest (monetary injury), and every time it did so, the

cause of this underpayment is directly traceable to (and, thus, directly

redressable by the damages paid by) Sunoco.

      Sunoco’s standing challenge focuses primarily on the Article III

standing of the Class members whose damages awards were allocated to

unclaimed state property funds. Sunoco argues that class members who

have not been located have not been injured, but it fails to offer any legal

support addressing its unclaimed property fund argument.

      The district court’s reasoning on standing is sound. “Each state has

created by statute a government agency that collects money held by

businesses for people who cannot be found. The agency holds the money on

behalf of the true owners.” Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1162. In turn, “[o]nce

the state receives the money on behalf of the individual, the owner can claim

                                      48
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 49



the money.” Id. at 1172 (citing Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 60, §§ 661, 663–64, 674–

75; Tex. Prop. Code Ann. §§ 74.304, 74.501 (state unclaimed property funds

for Oklahoma and Texas)). Therefore, “[p]aying the state amounts to paying

the owner or an agent or trustee on behalf of the owner. Thus, each class

member has suffered an injury because Sunoco has withheld interest it

owes to the owner.” Id.

      Sunoco has not presented persuasive arguments to the contrary.

Oklahoma has adopted the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, and “this

statutory scheme governs the distribution of unclaimed or abandoned

property in Oklahoma.” Unit Petroleum Co. v. Veitch, 79 F. Supp. 3d 1234,

1241 (N.D. Okla. 2015); see Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 60, § 651–88 (the Uniform

Unclaimed Property Act (UUPA)). Sunoco says the district court’s award to

the unclaimed property funds is an invalid order of “escheat,” which “is a

procedure with ancient origins whereby a sovereign may acquire title to

abandoned property if after a number of years no rightful owner appears.”

Dani v. Miller, 374 P.3d 779, 786 n.4 (Okla. 2016). But Sunoco’s effort to

defeat standing by its escheat argument is off the mark because the UUPA

is “not” an “escheat” statute. See TXO Prod. Corp. v. Oklahoma Corp.

Comm’n, 829 P.2d 964, 971–72 (Okla. 1992) (explaining that the UUPA is

not a true escheat statute but rather a custodial taking law). Oklahoma’s

unclaimed property fund “protects the owners of unclaimed property by

                                      49
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 50



providing an orderly system of recovery for presumably abandoned

property[.]” Dani, 374 P.3d at 788 (rejecting numerous constitutional

challenges to Oklahoma’s UUPA statute); see also Croslin v. Enerlex, Inc.,

308 P.3d 1041, 1049 (Okla. 2013) (advising that the UUPA properly ensures

“mineral proceeds of unknown and unlocated property owners will be

safeguarded[.]”). Which is to say, the payments to the unclaimed property

fund do not defeat the injury in fact requirement of standing.

     Both Oklahoma, where the oil wells at issue in this case are located,

and Texas, where Sunoco is headquartered and sends unclaimed funds for

which it has no owner information, Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1160, have

adopted the UUPA. Dani, 374 P.3d at 786; Clark v. Strayhorn, 184 S.W.3d

906, 910 (Tex. App. 2006). In contrast, Sunoco’s novel view on standing

would motivate oil and gas companies to make every effort to avoid locating

owners entitled to proceeds and interest under the PRSA. That would

undermine the statutory purpose of both the PRSA and the UUPA, which

is “designed so that unclaimed property is held by and for the benefit of the

state until the rightful owner can be found, and . . . is intended to prevent

a windfall to a private holder seeking to claim property for [itself].” Unit

Petroleum, 79 F. Supp. 3d at 1241 (citing Combs v. B.A.R.D. Indus. Inc., 299

S.W.3d 463, 471–72 (Tex. App. 2009)).



                                      50
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 51



      In addition, Sunoco’s standing argument fails because it admits, as it

must, that it owes a statutory duty to keep adequate records regarding its

royalty payments. See Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, § 570.12(A). And Sunoco’s

deficient recordkeeping is the reason these royalty owners are not identified

by name. In this case, “Cline offered evidence” showing that “Sunoco did not

make a bona fide effort to find people before sending their proceeds to

unclaimed property funds” and even “threatened to send one of Cline’s

interest checks to unclaimed property, even though it was in litigation with

Cline, knew his address, and had frequent contact with his lawyers[.]” Cline

II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1162 n.15.

      Thus, although “Sunoco has vigorously argued that its own records

are too unreliable to explain why it made a late payment,” we agree that

“interpret[ing] the PRSA to impose on the owners the burden to prove why

Sunoco withheld payment” in turn “would effectively allow Sunoco to hide

behind a mess of its own making, claiming innocence.” Id. at 1171 n.21; see

also Nieberding v. Barrette Outdoor Living, Inc., 302 F.R.D. 600, 607 (D.

Kan. 2014) (pointing out in a consumer class action the danger that a

defendant “could immunize itself from class certification by merely choosing

not to keep records[.]”).

      Simply put, every class member was underpaid by Sunoco and

therefore has standing based on a monetary injury that is traceable and

                                      51
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 52



redressable by Sunoco. See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425

(2021) (“If a defendant has caused . . . monetary injury to the plaintiff, the

plaintiff has suffered a concrete injury in fact under Article III.”). For all

these reasons, we reject Sunoco’s standing argument. 22

                                      C

      We next turn to the outcome of the bench trial – damages. This case

proceeded as a class action to trial, and then to post-trial proceedings to

allocate the damages to the Class. The district court issued its trial opinion

with its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as Federal Rule of Civil

Procedure 52(a) requires.

      On appeal, we review the district court’s legal rulings de novo and the

district court’s findings of fact “must not be set aside unless clearly

erroneous.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6). Thus, “deference to the trier of fact” is

“the rule, not the exception.” Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S.

564, 575 (1985). Our role is limited “[i]n reviewing the district court’s

findings after a bench trial for clear error,” and “we do not retry the facts.”




      22 In a footnote to its opening brief, Sunoco also argues that “any claim

to interest on proceeds sitting in unclaimed-property funds is not
prudentially ripe.” Because this argument is underdeveloped and
inadequately briefed, we deem it to be waived. Valdez v. Macdonald, 66
F.4th 796, 834 (10th Cir. 2023).
                                      52

MVT Servs., LLC v. Great W. Cas. Co., 118 F.4th 1274, 1281 (10th Cir.

2024).

      Sunoco challenges the award of prejudgment interest owed at a 12

percent rate, compounded annually, until the date the trial order was

published. 23 “When royalty proceeds are not paid within the time

constraints outlined in the [PRSA], interest begins to accrue and is

compounded annually.” Krug, 362 P.3d at 212. Sunoco primarily argues that

a significant amount of interest was added after the date of trial, which is

unfair and unlawful.

      Both parties frame this issue on appeal as a question of prejudgment

interest. This circuit has also described the damages owed for unpaid PRSA

statutory interest as “prejudgment interest,” Okland Oil Co. v. Conoco Inc.,

144 F.3d 1308, 1320 (10th Cir. 1998). Prejudgment interest in a diversity

action is “a substantive matter governed by state law.” Webco Indus., Inc.

v. Thermatool Corp., 278 F.3d 1120, 1134 (10th Cir. 2002).

      To the district court, Sunoco argued that “once it makes the late

payment to the interest owner, statutory interest stops accruing.” Cline II,


      23 As a cutoff date for when prejudgment interest stopped accruing,

the district court stated that it used the date that it issued its trial decision,
which was published on August 17, 2020. See Cline II, 479 F. Supp. at 1161
n.13 (explaining that “the interest owed in this case is $74,763,113.00 plus
any additional interest due from December 17, 2019, to the date of this
Opinion.”).

                                       53

479 F. Supp. 3d at 1175. In response, the Class argued that “Sunoco owes

compound interest until Sunoco pays the statutory interest.” Id. At trial and

on appeal, “Sunoco interprets ‘until the day paid’ to mean ‘until the day

Sunoco paid the proceeds.’ Thus, Sunoco argues that it does not owe

compound interest.” Id.; see Op. Br. at 51–52.

      The district court sided with the Class, determining that “compound

interest is a common feature in investments and means simply that interest

becomes part of the principal and therefore earns interest.” Cline II, 479 F.

Supp. 3d at 1175. It further cited and adopted the reasoning of Cockerell Oil

Props., Ltd v. Unit Petroleum Co., No. CIV-16-135-KEW, 2020 WL 2110904,

at *2 (E.D. Okla. May 4, 2020), which held that compound interest, as used

in the PRSA, is “unambiguous” and “provid[es] for the annual accrual of

interest on the accumulated interest on any unpaid proceeds not paid timely

under the provisions of that statute.”

      We start with the PRSA’s plain language. See Am. Airlines, Inc. v.

State, ex rel. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n, 341 P.3d 56, 64 (Okla. 2014) (“The

cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the

legislative intent and purpose as expressed by the statutory language.”).

The PRSA states, in relevant part:

      [T]hat portion [of the proceeds] not timely paid shall earn
      interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum to be


                                      54
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 55



      compounded annually, calculated from the end of the month in
      which such production is sold until the day paid.

Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, § 570.10(D)(1).

      As the Class argues, under Oklahoma law and universally across

jurisdictions, “amounts of unpaid interest become part of the principal; that

is the technical definition of ‘compound interest.’” Resp. Br. at 55.

Oklahoma’s statute defining compound interest says this expressly. See

Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 25, § 27 (“The words ‘compound interest’ mean interest

added to the principal as the former becomes due, and thereafter made to

bear interest.” (emphasis added)).

      As unpaid compound interest accrues, it is added to the principal,

effectively converting it from unpaid interest to become a portion of the

underlying unpaid principal proceeds that are owed to the plaintiff. See id.;

see also 47 C.J.S. Interest & Usury § 2 (“Compound interest is interest on

interest. It is paid both on the principal and the previously accumulated

interest. Accrued interest is added periodically to the principal, and interest

is computed upon the new principal thus formed. (footnotes omitted)”); 44B

Am. Jur. 2d Interest and Usury § 41 (same). Nor does Sunoco refute that,

generally, debt payments are applied to any unpaid interest before they

ever are applied to reduce the unpaid principal. See Resp. Br. at 56 (citing

Landess v. State ex rel. Comm’rs of Land Off., 335 P.2d 1077, 1079 (Okla.


                                      55

1958) (“[T]he rule is to apply the payments in the first place to the discharge

of the interest then due and the remainder on the principal.”) (internal

quotation marks omitted)).

      We agree with the dissent that the accrual date for payment stops the

day something is paid. Dissent at 3 (emphasis in original). However, the

dissent concludes the “something” is “that portion [of proceeds] not timely

paid.” Id. But this reading of the PRSA does not give adequate weight to the

language that commands those unpaid proceeds “shall earn interest . . . to

be compounded annually.” § 570.10(D)(1). Thus, under Oklahoma law, the

better reading of the PRSA is “take all of its provisions and read them as a

whole so that each provision will be in harmony with every other, . . . .”

Melton v. Quality Homes, Inc., 312 P.2d 476, 479 (Okla. 1957). The PRSA

mandates the payment of unpaid proceeds and compounded interest, so we

agree with the district court that the accrual date stops when “that portion

[of proceeds and compounded interest are] paid.” § 570.10(D)(1) (citation

modified).

      Even if the PRSA’s language on compound interest were ambiguous

(which it is not), we would affirm and reach the same result by applying

Oklahoma’s rules of statutory construction. See Am. Airlines, 341 P.3d at

64 (“If the legislative intent cannot be ascertained from the language of a

statute, as in the cases of ambiguity, we must apply rules of statutory

                                      56
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 57



construction.”). In interpreting the PRSA specifically, the Oklahoma

Supreme Court has directed that “[l]egislative intent controls statutory

interpretation.” Krug, 362 P.3d at 210. So we must “give effect to the

legislative intent and the public policy underlying the intent.” Am. Airlines,

341 P.3d at 65.

      Furthermore, the Oklahoma “Legislature has expressed its intent

that it shall be the public policy in Oklahoma for royalty owners to receive

prompt payment from the sale of oil and gas products.” Hull, 789 P.2d at

1279; see also In re Tulsa Energy, Inc., 111 F.3d 88, 90 (10th Cir. 1997)

(same). To this end, “[f]rom 1980 to 1989,” the PRSA “provided for interest

of twelve percent per annum, without compounding.” Hebble v. Shell W. E

& P, Inc., 238 P.3d 939, 945 (Okla. Civ. App. 2009). 24 Not only does the

statute now mandate that unpaid proceeds “shall earn interest at the rate

of twelve percent (12%) per annum to be compounded annually . . . until the

day paid,” but “[t]he prejudgment interest authorized by § 570.10

constitutes a part of the judgment and is considered a part of the total

liability recovered.” Id. (quoting § 570.10); see also id. at 946 (advising that

“prejudgment interest under the PRSA is part of [the] compensatory


      24 Hebble involved a challenge to the trial court’s instruction to the

jury about the awarding of prejudgment interest under the PRSA. 238 P.3d
at 946. It did not interpret the PRSA’s “until the day paid” language that is
at issue here.

damages” to be awarded). We decline to reach a conclusion that “conflicts

with the spirit and letter of [the PRSA] and [violates] the public policy

intended to be promoted through its enactment – prompt payment to royalty

owners of proceeds from the sale of oil or gas.” Hull, 789 P.2d at 1280.

      Under Oklahoma law, and the law of most states generally, 25

“[p]rejudgment interest serves to compensate for the loss of use of money

due as damages from the time the claim accrues until judgment is entered,

thereby achieving full compensation for the injury those damages are

intended to redress.” Krug, 362 P.3d at 214. Indeed, “[i]t is an element of

the total liability adjudicated.” Id.

      On top of this, we are bound to recognize that the Oklahoma

“Legislature has followed a path of strengthening mineral owners[’] rights

since the [PRSA’s] inception.” Id.; see also Hull, 789 P.2d at 1279 (same).

The Oklahoma legislature “removed” language in the PRSA that led courts




      25 “Prejudgment interest . . . is part of the actual damages sought to

be recovered.” Webco Indus., Inc. v. Thermatool Corp., 278 F.3d 1120, 1134
(10th Cir. 2002) (quoting Johnson v. Continental Airlines Corp., 964 F.2d
1059, 1062–63 (10th Cir. 1992)). Thus, “[p]rejudgment interest is an
element of complete compensation,” and without awarding prejudgment
interest, a plaintiff is not made whole because it loses out on the time value
of money. Morrison Knudsen Corp. v. Ground Improvement Techs., Inc., 532
F.3d 1063, 1073 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting West Virginia v. United States,
479 U.S. 305, 310 (1987)).

to interpret the statute as punitive. Krug, 362 P.3d at 213 n.24. When a

legislature amends a statute, we presume that “it intends its amendment

to have real and substantial effect.” Bufkin v. Collins, 145 S. Ct. 728, 741

(2025) (quoting Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 542 U.S. 241,

258–59 (2004)); see also Estrada v. Smart, 107 F.4th 1254, 1268 (10th Cir.

2024) (same). Taken together, we discern from the statutory text and a clear

legislative intent to make royalty owners whole by compensating them for

the lost time value of their money.

     Sunoco claims it is unfair to compound the prejudgment interest owed

because the delays caused by the district court’s initial order allocating

damages – which we reversed – caused an increase in the amount of

prejudgment interest. But “courts should not read into a statute exceptions

not made by the Legislature.” Antini v. Antini, 440 P.3d 57, 60 (Okla. 2019)

(quoting Seventeen Hundred Peoria, Inc. v. City of Tulsa, 422 P.2d 840, 843

(Okla. 1966)). Similarly, the PRSA states that prejudgment interest “shall”

accrue at 12 percent, and “the word ‘shall’ is a mandatory command” we are

obligated to follow. State ex rel. W. State Hosp. v. Stoner, 614 P.2d 59, 63

(Okla. 1980); see also Smith v. Spizzirri, 601 U.S. 472, 476 (2024) (same).

As a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction, we are “not free to

engraft” any “exceptions or modifications” to Oklahoma law. Day &

Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, 423 U.S. 3, 4 (1975). Our “proper function”

                                      59
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 60



in a diversity case “is to ascertain what the state law is, not what it ought

to be.” Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 497 (1941).

      Moreover, we have also already considered and rejected the notion of

an equitable exception argument to prejudgment interest. Applying

Colorado law, which is substantially similar to Oklahoma law on

prejudgment interest, we held that it was reversible error to insert an

equitable exception into a state statute awarding prejudgment interest. See

Echo Acceptance Corp. v. Household Retail Servs., Inc., 267 F.3d 1068, 1092

(10th Cir. 2001) (“Regardless of the factors that contributed to the length of

time during which prejudgment interest was accruing[,]” there is “no

discretion” to add an equitable exception.). A state prejudgment interest

statute – whether Colorado’s or Oklahoma’s – “merely recognizes the time

value of money” and restores the plaintiff to the position the plaintiff would

have been in but for the defendant’s harm. Id. (internal quotation marks

omitted).

      Finally, Sunoco argues that the Energy Litigation Reform Act

(ELRA), Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, §§ 901-03, expressly limits the scope of

damages and “confirms that extra-statutory prejudgment interest is off the

table.” Op. Br. at 54. Sunoco contends the ELRA, which was enacted in

2012, requires that “no interest beyond what the PRSA awards as

damages—which stops accruing once proceeds are paid—may be awarded.”

                                      60
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1    Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 61



Id. It is questionable whether this ELRA argument was properly raised

before the district court to not be forfeited on appeal, Richison v. Ernest

Group, Inc., 634 F.3d 1123, 1128 (10th Cir. 2011), however, the Class does

not raise forfeiture in its Response Brief because it does not mention

Sunoco’s   ELRA     argument      regarding   prejudgment     interest   at   all.

Nevertheless, Sunoco cites no authority to support its reading that the

ELRA mandates that interest stops accruing once proceeds are paid, and

we are aware of none. Based upon the thin argument presented and the

depth of authority that supports our holding, we are not persuaded that

Sunoco’s ELRA argument alters our reading of the PRSA’s compound

interest or merits Sunoco any relief.

      We affirm the district court’s final actual damages award, which

included the additional prejudgment interest added until the entry of the

district court’s trial opinion.

                                        D

      The last argument we reach is Sunoco’s challenge to the punitive

damages award. The district court awarded $75 million in punitive

damages, ruling that Sunoco willfully violated the PRSA by failing to pay

interest that it knew was owed to every class member without receiving an




                                        61

individual demand from each royalty owner. Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at

1178–81.

      On appeal, Sunoco argues that punitive damages are available only

for tort claims, not claims for breach of contract, and the PRSA claim must

be interpreted as a breach of contract claim under Oklahoma law. In

response, the Class argues that the PRSA creates a statutory tort, and that

the ELRA expressly allows punitive damages in a case also involving a

claim and liability under the PRSA. See Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, § 903

(allowing punitive damages under the ELRA if a factfinder determines

“upon clear and convincing evidence” that the defendant failed to pay

required proceeds “with the actual, knowing and willful intent: (a) to

deceive the person to whom the proceeds were due, or (b) to deprive proceeds

from the person the holder knows, or is aware, is legally entitled thereto”).

We agree with Sunoco and vacate the punitive damages award.

      The district court found that the Class had to clear two hurdles to be

awarded punitive damages, the ELRA and the Oklahoma punitive damages

statute, Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, § 9.1. By awarding punitive damages, the

district court found that the Class was successful in its clearance of both.

However, the punitive damages award runs afoul of Oklahoma law, which

precludes punitive damages for a breach of contract claim. See Okla. Stat.

Ann. tit. 23, § 9.1(A) (“In an action for the breach of an obligation not arising

                                       62
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 63



from contract, the jury, in addition to actual damages, may, . . . award

punitive damages . . .) (emphasis added).

      Taking a step back, we acknowledge again that the only claim before

us on appeal is the PRSA claim because the Class did not prevail on the

fraud claim at trial. Under Oklahoma law, a claim under the PRSA is

construed as a claim for breach of contract. Purcell, 961 P.2d at 193; see also

Krug, 362 P.3d at 213 (explaining that the 12 percent interest owed under

the PRSA “should not be characterized as a penalty but, rather, an integral

part of a contractual claim”). Which is to also say, under Oklahoma law, a

party cannot recover punitive damages unless it also prevails on an

independent tort claim for fraud, deceit by nondisclosure, or a similar tort

claim that permits punitive damages. We made this point in our decision in

Zenith Drilling Corp. v. Internorth, Inc., 869 F.2d 560 (10th Cir. 1989),

where we explained that punitive damages are available under Oklahoma

law in a case involving a breach of contract only when a plaintiff prevails

on an “independent, willful tort[.]” Id. at 565 (quoting Z.D. Howard Co. v.

Cartwright, 537 P.2d 345, 347 (Okla. 1975)).

      To sidestep the general rule that a party cannot receive punitive

damages based on a breach of contract claim, the Class argues that the

PRSA created a statutory tort. This argument has been rejected by

Oklahoma courts. See, e.g., Purcell, 961 P.2d at 191–94 (rejecting the

                                      63
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 64



argument that the PRSA creates “statutory liability” that arises

“separately” and instead stating that the “12 [percent] interest” awarded as

PRSA damages is “part of the contractual claim”); Krug, 362 P.3d at 213

(explaining that the 12 percent interest owed under the PRSA “should not

be characterized as a penalty but, rather, an integral part of a contractual

claim”); Hebble, 238 P.3d at 945 (“[t]he PRSA does not create a statutory

claim.”).

      In Purcell, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that a PRSA violation

“is based upon a breach of the obligation to pay the royalty arising ex

contractu in the manner prescribed by [the PRSA].” 961 P.2d at 193 (citation

omitted); see also Ex Contractu, Black’s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024)

(defining “ex contractu” as “[a]rising from a contract”); see also Uptegraft v.

Home Ins. Co., 662 P.2d 681, 684–85 (Okla. 1983) (holding that a claim for

relief that is ex contractu “is clearly a contract action”). Just last year, the

Oklahoma Supreme Court reaffirmed this language from Purcell, holding

that “claims under the PRSA are really an action ex contractu—i.e., they

arise out of a contract[.]” Base, 563 P.3d at 953 (emphases in original). The

continued expression of this legal principle by Oklahoma courts leaves no

reason for us to doubt that a PRSA claim is a breach of contract and thus

excluded from potential punitive damages awards by statute.

  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 65



     The Class also argues that the ELRA is another route to the punitive

damages award. The district court assumed the ELRA was applicable and

focused on whether “Sunoco’s conduct overcomes the ELRA’s bar to punitive

damages.” Cline II, 479 F. Supp. 3d at 1178.

     As the Class did here, a plaintiff can pursue a PRSA breach of contract

claim for underpayment of royalties alongside a claim for common law fraud

or deceit in the same case. See Okland Oil Co., 144 F.3d at 1314. The

Oklahoma Supreme Court has also held that “the claims of fraud, deceit,

constructive fraud, and punitive damages are appropriate for class

certification.” Weber v. Mobil Oil Corp., 243 P.3d 1, 7 (Okla. 2010). As a

result, there is no barrier to a single plaintiff or a class pursuing and

recovering damages for both a PRSA breach of contract and a fraud claim

in the same case.

     Oklahoma law, however, draws a distinction between the claims for

breach of contract and fraud. See Finnell v. Seismic, 67 P.3d 339, 345 (Okla.

2003) (explaining that the “words negligent and willful are legal terms of

art that refer to tortious conduct” rather than a “breach of contract”). A

PRSA claim, which is construed as a breach of contract, does not require

any showing of “actual, knowing and willful intent” to deceive or deprive




                                      65
  Appellate Case: 23-7090   Document: 99-1   Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 66



the victim of proceeds, which is required to obtain punitive damages under

the ELRA. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, § 903.

      In this context, owners suing for an intentional tort like fraud or

deceit are alleging fraud in the performance of existing contracts (or leases),

not that they detrimentally relied on the promises of the defendant to enter

a contract or a lease in the first place (i.e., fraudulent inducement). The

owners “already ha[ve] a protectable interest” to be paid royalties (and

interest for late payments under the PRSA) based on their existing

“contracts” or leases. In re U.S. Foodservice Inc. Pricing Litig., 729 F.3d 108,

123 (2d Cir. 2013). 26

      The dissent voices strong opposition to this reasoning and concludes

that our reading of “§ 9.1, a general statute governing punitive damages in

breach-of-contract cases, as somehow overriding § 903’s exclusive remedy.”

Dissent at 7. We agree with the dissent that, under Oklahoma law, “when

there is a conflict between two statutes, one specific . . . and one general,

the statute enacted for the purpose of dealing with the subject matter


      26 Both  fraudulent inducement and fraud in the performance of an
existing contract are cognizable forms of fraud. In re U.S. Foodservice Inc.
Pricing Litig., 729 F.3d 108, 123 (2d Cir. 2013). This court approvingly
discussed the Second Circuit’s decision in In re U.S. Foodservice and other
similar cases (including state common law fraud decisions) in CGC Holding
Co., LLC v. Broad & Cassel, 773 F.3d 1076, 1089–91 (10th Cir. 2014),
explaining that class certification of a fraud claim can be based on
“circumstantial proof of classwide reliance.”

controls over the general statute.” Stitt v. Treat, 546 P.3d 882, 893 (Okla.

2024). But we discern no conflict in the statutes here and instead determine

that Oklahoma’s punitive damages statute § 9.1 “must be read

harmoniously” with the ELRA § 903. Id. at 892. Which is to say, we agree

the ELRA allows for punitive damages to be awarded in a PRSA case so long

as the plaintiff alleges and proves an independent, intentional tort to the

statutory standard set out in the ELRA § 903.

     The trial found that Sunoco’s liability arose from a PRSA violation

(breach of contract), not an intentional tort (fraud). Because the Class did

not prevail on its independent, intentional tort claim, the ELRA does not

provide a backdoor to an award of punitive damages in this case. As a result,

with only a PRSA claim proved at trial, which we must interpret as a breach

of contract under Oklahoma law, the punitive damages award cannot stand.

For these reasons, we vacate the punitive damages award.

                                     III

     We AFFIRM the district court’s orders granting class certification

and denying post-trial class decertification, along with the orders

determining the actual damages awarded to the Class, including

prejudgment interest. We VACATE the punitive damages award and

REMAND for the district court to amend the judgment consistent with this

opinion.

23-7090, Cline v. Sunoco

MORITZ, Circuit Judge, concurring in part, dissenting in part.

      I join sections II.A and II.B of the majority opinion analyzing class

certification and standing. I write separately to address the interest and punitive

damages Cline can recover under Oklahoma law.

      As I see it, Oklahoma’s Production Revenue Standards Act (PRSA), Okla.

Stat. tit. 52, §§ 570.1–570.15, dictates that interest on unpaid oil proceeds stops

accruing once the proceeds are paid, even if some amount of statutory interest

remains outstanding. So unlike the majority, I would vacate the district court’s nearly

$104 million interest award (which reflects accrual through the date of judgment) and

remand for recalculation.

      As for punitive damages, I would give effect to the Energy Litigation Reform

Act (ELRA), Okla. Stat. tit. 52, §§ 901–903, which specifically authorizes punitive

awards against defendants that willfully withhold proceeds. Because the ELRA and

PRSA provide the exclusive remedies for these oil and gas claims, Oklahoma’s

general prohibition on punitive damages in contract cases—which the majority sees

as a barrier to Cline’s recovery—simply does not apply here. Punitive damages

would thus be available if the district court made an appropriate finding. But the

district court found that Sunoco intended to withhold the interest, not the proceeds.

So I join the majority in vacating the $75 million punitive award but would remand

for the district court to reconsider punitive damages under the correct ELRA

standard.

       Fundamentally, both issues turn on the special statutes applicable to the oil and

gas industry. I start by explaining the relevant statutes and then discuss their

application to the interest and punitive-damages questions raised here.

       Oklahoma has carved out a distinct set of rules for oil and gas disputes, of

which the PRSA and the ELRA are part. See generally Okla. Stat. tit. 52 (“Oil and

Gas”). Per the ELRA, the PRSA provides the “exclusive remedy” for late payment of

oil and gas proceeds (subject to certain listed exceptions not relevant here). Okla.

Stat. tit. 52, § 903. When a company like Sunoco fails to pay well owners on time,

well owners can recoup “actual damages,” which are “limited to the proceeds due and

the interest as provided in [the PRSA].” Id. Actual damages “are deemed to be

adequate remedies for failure to pay proceeds,” unless a court finds that the defendant

withheld proceeds with the requisite intent, in which case punitive damages are

available, too. Id.

       Because Oklahoma has specifically enumerated the sole remedies for late

payment of proceeds—and clarified that such remedies fully compensate plaintiffs—

we don’t need to look to the state’s general remedies statutes to determine what

remedies are available here. See Okla. Stat. tit. 23, §§ 6, 9.1 (part of Chapter 1,

“Damages in General,” of Title 23, “Damages”). Instead, we go straight to the oil and

gas statutes, which answer both damages questions on appeal.

       Let’s begin with the PRSA’s statutory interest provision. It says:

       [W]here proceeds from the sale of oil or gas production or some portion of
       such proceeds are not paid prior to the end of the applicable time periods
       provided in this section, that portion not timely paid shall earn interest at

                                             2
   Appellate Case: 23-7090       Document: 99-1       Date Filed: 11/17/2025       Page: 70



       the rate of . . . 12%[] per annum to be compounded annually, calculated
       from the end of the month in which such production is sold until the day
       paid.
Okla. Stat. tit. 52, § 570.10(D)(1). Like most statutes, it isn’t the easiest thing to read. But

it is clear about how long interest accrues: “until the day paid.” Id.

       Right off the bat, this means the district court erred in awarding interest up to

the date it entered judgment, and the majority errs in affirming this faulty analysis.

The district court’s award might have been appropriate if Oklahoma’s statute

assessed interest until “the date of payment or . . . the date judgment is entered,

whichever first occurs,” like a Colorado statute governing prejudgment interest in

contract suits. Echo Acceptance Corp. v. Household Retail Srvs., Inc., 267 F.3d 1068,

1092 (10th Cir. 2001) (quoting Colo. Rev. Stat. § 5-12-102(1)(b)). But the PRSA

doesn’t say that, so the date of judgment can’t be the correct stop date.

       What is the correct accrual stop date? Well, “the day [something is] paid.”

§ 570.10(D)(1). And that something, if one looks back at the statute, is “that portion

[of proceeds] not timely paid.” 1 Id. Putting this all together, PRSA interest accrues

“from the end of the month in which [the oil] is sold until the day [the proceeds from

the sale are belatedly] paid.” Id. This makes intuitive as well as textual sense: once

late proceeds are paid, interest stops accruing.




       1
         The relevant clause reads, “where proceeds from the sale of oil or gas
production . . . are not paid prior to the end of the applicable time periods provided in
this section, that portion not timely paid shall earn interest . . . , calculated from the
end of the month in which such production is sold until the day paid.” § 570.10(D)(1)
(emphasis added).
                                               3
   Appellate Case: 23-7090     Document: 99-1      Date Filed: 11/17/2025     Page: 71



      Yes, this means PRSA statutory interest functions differently than typical

prejudgment interest. But that’s the point of creating special rules, as Oklahoma’s

done for oil and gas disputes. Indeed, the state’s choice to jettison traditional

prejudgment-interest rules in favor of distinct rules designed for oil and gas royalties

is also apparent in the accrual start dates. Generally, Oklahoma law provides that

prejudgment interest begins accruing from a payment’s due date. See Okla. Stat. tit.

23, § 6 (providing for interest from the day on which “the right to recover [a debt] is

vested in . . . the creditor”). And under the PRSA, proceeds are due “not later than

the last day of the second succeeding month after the end of the month within which

such production is sold”—in other words, roughly two months after the oil sells.

§ 570.10(B)(1)(b). But PRSA statutory interest starts accruing before that, at “the end

of the month in which such production is sold.” § 570.10(D)(1). This gives well

owners two more months of interest than they would receive under traditional

prejudgment-interest principles, thereby increasing the penalty for payments that are

even slightly late. I see this as further proof that Oklahoma intended to displace

traditional prejudgment interest in favor of a distinct statutory remedy for late

payment of oil and gas proceeds.

      Yet the majority avoids this straightforward understanding by way of the

PRSA’s requirement that interest “be compounded annually.” Id. “‘[C]ompound

interest’ mean[s] interest added to the principal . . . and thereafter made to bear

interest.” Okla. Stat. tit. 25, § 27. From that uncontroversial premise, the majority

leaps to the conclusion that adding interest to the principal when calculating interest

                                            4
   Appellate Case: 23-7090      Document: 99-1      Date Filed: 11/17/2025      Page: 72



on proceeds “effectively convert[s] . . . unpaid interest to . . . unpaid . . . proceeds.”

Maj. Op. 55.

        But nowhere does Oklahoma law say that the process of compounding—a

simple mathematical step—somehow changes what the law considers “[p]roceeds

from the sale of oil or gas production from an oil or gas well.” § 570.10(B)(1). And

reading all the PRSA’s provisions “in harmony,” as the majority urges, doesn’t

change my assessment. Maj. Op. 57 (quoting Metlon v. Quality Homes, Inc., 312 P.2d

476, 479 (Okla. 1957)). To the contrary, the statute’s use of “proceeds” and “accrued

interest” confirms that the two are separate. § 570.10(D)(2)(b). Addressing the

treatment of “proceeds which have not been paid because of unmarketable title,” the

PRSA provides for interest to be “compounded annually” and authorizes parties “to

interplead the proceeds and all accrued [compound] interest into court.”

§ 570.10(D)(2)(a), (b) (emphasis added). If proceeds and accrued compound interest

were one and the same, as the majority asserts, the statute wouldn’t need to reference

both.

        Perhaps anticipating these textual weaknesses, the majority suggests that

Oklahoma legislative intent favors its interpretation. Yet the legislative goal it cites—

that “royalty owners . . . receive prompt payment from the sale of oil and gas

products”—is equally served by awarding interest until proceeds are paid. Maj. Op.

57 (quoting Hull v. Sun Refin. & Mktg. Co., 789 P.2d 1272, 1279 (Okla. 1989)). If

interest accrues until proceeds are paid, as it does under these unique statutes,

companies like Sunoco have an incentive to pay well owners on time. Awarding

                                             5
   Appellate Case: 23-7090       Document: 99-1        Date Filed: 11/17/2025   Page: 73



additional interest after that just incentivizes companies to pay the interest, not to pay

on time in the first place. So in my book, the legislative intent doesn’t tip the scales.

       Accordingly, I would hold that Oklahoma law does not authorize statutory

interest to accrue after late proceeds are paid, even if interest is outstanding. The

district court awarded Cline interest through entry of judgment, long after Sunoco

paid the overdue proceeds. The interest award has since ballooned to nearly $104

million, over twice the roughly $49 million Sunoco concedes it could be liable for. In

upholding that award, the majority significantly misinterprets Oklahoma’s statutory

scheme and turns legislative intent on its head. I would thus vacate and remand for

the district court to recalculate interest through the date of payment, consistent with

§ 570.10(D)(1).

       Now to punitive damages. As with the interest issue, I confine my analysis to

the relevant oil and gas statute, § 903. That provision generally forecloses punitive

damages for late payment of proceeds, except if:

       there [is] a determination by the finder of fact upon clear and convincing
       evidence that the holder who failed to pay such proceeds did so with the
       actual, knowing[,] and willful intent: (a) to deceive the person to whom the
       proceeds were due, or (b) to deprive proceeds from the person the holder
       knows, or is aware, is legally entitled thereto.
§ 903. The clear aim of the statute is to permit punitive damages in late-payment actions

if the district court makes a sufficient intent finding.

       Nevertheless, the majority concludes that the punitive damage award must be

vacated not because the district court’s findings were insufficient, but because the

award doesn’t pass muster under Okla. Stat. tit. 23, § 9.1. That provision, entitled

                                               6
   Appellate Case: 23-7090      Document: 99-1      Date Filed: 11/17/2025     Page: 74



“[p]unitive damages awards by jury,” sets out criteria for awarding punitive damages

in “action[s] for the breach of . . . obligation[s] not arising from contract.” § 9.1.

Because late-payment claims are based on an underlying contract, the majority

reasons that punitive damages are unavailable for such claims.

       Once again, the majority’s holding is seriously flawed in that it directly

contravenes the Oklahoma legislature’s express directive in the ELRA that the PRSA

provides the “exclusive remedy” for late payment of oil and gas proceeds. § 903

(emphasis added). In fact, it’s hard to imagine a more blatant deviation from this

directive than the path taken by the majority here. Instead of adhering to the

“exclusive remedy” for late payment of oil and gas proceeds, id., the majority elects

to interpret § 9.1, a general statute governing punitive damages in breach-of-contract

cases, as somehow overriding § 903’s exclusive remedy.

       Even more perplexingly, the majority does so based on language from Purcell

v. Santa Fe Minerals, Inc., 961 P.2d 188 (Okla. 1998)—a case that preceded the

enactment of the ELRA and its exclusive remedy provision. There, the Oklahoma

Supreme Court unsurprisingly observed that PRSA interest is “part of [a] contractual

claim.” Id. at 193. Extrapolating from this observation, the majority concludes that

plaintiffs can never recover punitive damages on PRSA statutory claims, like Cline’s,

because those claims are based on royalty agreements—that is, underlying

contracts—and § 9.1 prohibits such damages.

       In addition to ignoring that the general punitive-damages statute, § 9.1, is

irrelevant here, the majority ignores that Purcell didn’t consider whether a general

                                             7
  Appellate Case: 23-7090      Document: 99-1      Date Filed: 11/17/2025    Page: 75



statute governing punitive damages can somehow negate the ELRA’s exclusive-

remedy provision governing late-payment remedies, including punitive damages. See

Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat’l Pension Fund, 493 U.S. 365, 375 (1990) (“It is

an elementary tenet of statutory construction that ‘where there is no clear intention

otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one.’”

(cleaned up) (quoting Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550–51 (1974)). Nor could it

have, because Oklahoma didn’t enact the ELRA—the statute clarifying that the

PRSA and the ELRA’s punitive-damages provision provide the exclusive remedy for

withheld proceeds—until 2012, well after the Oklahoma Supreme Court decided

Purcell. Rather, Purcell addressed the applicable statute of limitations for a claim to

statutory damages under the PRSA. See 961 P.2d at 194. And although the Oklahoma

Supreme Court later relied on Purcell’s characterization of late-payment claims in

Base v. Devon Energy Production Co., it again said nothing about the available

damages. 563 P.3d 934, 953–54 (Okla. 2024).

      The majority’s underlying premise seems to be that we can’t give effect to an

Oklahoma statute expressly permitting punitive damages in one setting if a

preexisting statute more generally prohibits punitive damages. Of course, that is not

the case. See BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 614 (1996) (Ginsburg, J.,

dissenting) (“At least one state legislature has prohibited punitive damages

altogether, unless explicitly provided by statute.”). “A fundamental premise of

statutory construction is that a specific statute dealing with a subject controls over the

general statute on the subject, unless it appears the legislature intended the general

                                            8

act to control.” Wetherill v. Bank IV Kan., N.A., 145 F.3d 1187, 1193 (10th Cir.

1998). The majority suggests we needn’t apply this principal because it “discern[s]

no conflict in the statutes here.” Maj. Op. 67. But under “a common-sense reading of

the various provisions,” the typical PRSA action would, in the majority’s view, fail

§ 9.1 even if it satisfied § 903. Cherokee Nation v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 564 P.3d

58, 70 (Okla. 2025) (analyzing potential conflict). That’s an effective conflict

warranting application of § 903, “[a] statute . . . enacted for the primary purpose of

dealing with a particular subject, and which prescribes the terms and conditions of

that particular subject matter,” over § 9.1, “a general statute which does not refer to

the particular subject matter, but does contain language which might be broad enough

to cover the subject matter if the special statute was not in existence.” Multiple Inj.

Tr. Fund v. Coburn, 386 P.3d 628, 635–36 (Okla. 2016).

       All this to say, I depart from the majority and read Oklahoma’s dedicated

punitive-damages statute regarding late payment of oil and gas proceeds exactly as

the Oklahoma legislature intended it to be read. That is, § 903 authorizes punitive

damages if the district court finds that the defendant intended to deceive or deprive

the well owner of the withheld proceeds. Full stop.

       Nevertheless, I agree with the majority that the district court’s punitive

damages award cannot survive in its current state. To justify punitive damages, the

defendant must have “inten[ded] . . . to deceive . . . or . . . deprive [the well owner of]

proceeds”—not interest. § 903 (emphasis added). But the district court focused its

punitive-damages analysis on interest. It concluded that “Sunoco knew that it owed

                                            9
  Appellate Case: 23-7090     Document: 99-1      Date Filed: 11/17/2025    Page: 77



interest on late payments, but it made no effort to identify those payments to

determine the interest it owed—much less pay that interest.” App. vol. 2, 451. But

that rationale cannot sustain a punitive-damages award under § 903 because Sunoco’s

intent in withholding proceeds may have differed from its intent in withholding

interest. As such, I would vacate and remand the punitive damages award against

Sunoco so the district court could analyze the evidence of intent under this standard.

      Accordingly, I join the majority opinion except as to its discussions of interest

and punitive damages. Hewing closely to the text of Oklahoma’s oil and gas statutes,

I respectfully dissent from the majority’s affirmance of the interest award. I concur in

the vacatur of punitive damages, but I would remand for the district court to consider

awarding punitive damages under the appropriate standard.
