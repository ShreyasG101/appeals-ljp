* Chief Judge Christina Reiss, of the United States District Court for the District of

      FOR APPELLANT:                              C.K. Lee, Lee Litigation Group,
                                                  PLLC, New York, NY

      FOR APPELLEE:                               Raymond J. Aab, New York,
                                                  NY

      Appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern

District of New York (Allyne R. Ross, Judge).

      UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED,

AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is VACATED, and the

case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.

      In Duran v. La Boom Disco, Inc., 955 F.3d 279 (2d Cir. 2020), vacated, 141 S.

Ct. 2509 (2021), we held that to qualify as an “automatic telephone dialing

system” within the meaning of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA),

47 U.S.C. § 227, a device must have the capacity either to store telephone

numbers, regardless of how those numbers are stored, or to produce telephone

numbers using a random or sequential number generator.

      The Supreme Court vacated our judgment in Duran and remanded the

case to this Court for further consideration in light of Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 592

U.S. 395 (2021). In Facebook, the Supreme Court held that to qualify as an

automatic telephone dialing system under the TCPA, a device must have the

                                          2
capacity either to store a telephone number using a random or sequential

number generator or to produce a telephone number using a random or

sequential generator. Id. at 409.

      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is

VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with

Facebook.

                                     FOR THE COURT:
                                     Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court
