        2                      Opinion of the Court                 24-11396

               This appeal requires us to decide whether a convenience
        store’s general liability insurance policy covers injuries suffered by
        an employee who was shot while leaving work. Amanali Babwari
        worked as a clerk at a convenience store in Birmingham, Alabama.
        While Babwari was leaving work one night, an assailant robbed
        and shot him. After Babwari obtained a consent judgment against
        his employer, he brought this action to compel his employer’s in-
        surer, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, to pay the consent
        judgment. The district court entered summary judgment for
        Babwari. Because the policy’s employer liability exclusion bars cov-
        erage, we reverse and remand with instructions to enter summary
        judgment for State Farm.
                                I. BACKGROUND
               Amanali Babwari worked as a clerk at the Pit Stop Grocery,
        a convenience store in Birmingham, Alabama. On the night of Oc-
        tober 10, 2016, Babwari worked the closing shift by himself. He
        closed the store at around 11:00 pm and locked the front door. At
        that time, Babwari was off the clock.
               He then walked to his car, which was parked in an unlit cor-
        ner of the store’s parking lot next to a dumpster. Babwari’s em-
        ployer required him to park in that location. As Babwari entered
        his car, an unknown assailant approached from behind the dump-
        ster and shot him. The assailant demanded Barwari “give [him] all
        [he] got,” so Babwari gave the assailant a bag with approximately
        $100 in small bills. The assailant then shot Babwari several more
        times and fled. Babwari was hit by at least nine bullets. He

        managed to call 911 and was taken by ambulance to the hospital
        where he recovered over several weeks.
               On April 28, 2017, Babwari sued Pit Stop in an Alabama
        court for negligence and wantonness because it failed to take rea-
        sonable security measures. He also brought a claim in the alterna-
        tive under the Alabama Employer’s Liability Act. See ALA. CODE
        §§ 25–6–1 through 25–6–4. State Farm initially defended Pit Stop
        under a reservation of rights, but it later determined that the policy
        did not cover Babwari’s injuries and stopped defending against the
        suit. Pit Stop and Babwari then settled and moved for entry of a
        consent judgment against Pit Stop for $877,659.66. The state court
        entered the consent judgment, without stating which of Babwari’s
        three claims supplied the basis for liability.
                Babwari then brought an action in state court against State
        Farm under Alabama’s Direct-Action Statute, which permits pre-
        vailing plaintiffs like Babwari to “proceed against the defendant and
        [its] insurer to reach and apply [any available] insurance money to
        the satisfaction of [a] judgment.” ALA. CODE § 27–23–2. State
        Farm’s liability hinges on whether the store owners had coverage
        for Babwari’s injuries. See St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Nowlin,
        542 So. 2d 1190, 1194 (Ala. 1988). The State Farm policy covers
        “bodily injury” that is “caused by an ‘occurrence.’” It defines “oc-
        currence” as “an accident, including continuous or repeated expo-
        sure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.” The
        policy also contains several exclusions, including for “bodily in-
        jury” that “is expected or intended to cause harm as would be

        expected by a reasonable person”; “is the result of willful and mali-
        cious, or criminal acts of the insured”; “aris[es] out of and in the
        course of . . . [e]mployment by the insured; or [p]erforming duties
        related to the conduct of the insured’s business”; or “aris[es] out of
        any . . . [e]mployment-related practices, policies, acts or omis-
        sions.”
                State Farm removed the suit to the district court. The parties
        both moved for summary judgment. State Farm argued that
        Babwari’s injuries were not covered by the policy because they did
        not constitute an “occurrence.” It also argued that the four exclu-
        sions recited above precluded coverage. And it argued that Babwari
        could not establish coverage because the consent judgment did not
        specify which of Babwari’s three claims provided the basis for lia-
        bility, and at least Babwari’s wantonness and Employer’s Liability
        Act claims were excluded from coverage. Babwari argued that his
        injuries were covered by the policy and that no exclusion applied.
                The district court granted summary judgment for Babwari.
        It interpreted the policy to cover injuries from negligence but not
        wantonness. Although Babwari asserted a claim for wantonness in
        the underlying state action, the district court reviewed the record
        from that proceeding and ruled that “there [was] no evidence . . .
        that would support a finding” that the store acted wantonly. By
        process of elimination, the district court determined that the negli-
        gence claim must have provided the basis for liability in the consent
        judgment. The district court did not address whether Babwari’s
        claim under the Employer’s Liability Act could have provided a

        basis for liability. It ruled that Babwari’s injuries counted as an “oc-
        currence” covered under the policy and ruled that no exclusion
        barred coverage. It entered judgment for Babwari and ordered
        State Farm to pay the $877,659.66 consent judgment plus
        $262,035.51 in pre-judgment interest.
                           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
               We review a summary judgment de novo. Pa. Nat. Mut. Cas.
        Ins. Co. v. St. Catherine of Siena Parish, 790 F.3d 1173, 1177 (11th Cir.
        2015).
                                  III. DISCUSSION
               State Farm raises three arguments on appeal. First, it argues
        that the district court erred by holding that Babwari’s negligence
        claim provided the basis for liability in the consent judgment. Sec-
        ond, it argues that Babwari’s injuries are not covered by the policy
        because they were not an “occurrence.” Third, it argues that the
        employer’s liability exclusion bars coverage of Babwari’s injuries.
              We need not address the first two arguments. Even if
        Babwari prevailed on them, he could not establish liability if a pol-
        icy exclusion applies. We address only State Farm’s third argu-
        ment, which is dispositive.
               The employer’s liability exclusion bars coverage of injuries
        “arising out of and in the course of” the “[e]mployment by the in-
        sured” or the “[p]erform[ance] [of] duties related to the conduct of
        the insured’s business.” That language mirrors the Alabama work-
        ers’ compensation statute, which covers “injur[ies] . . . arising out
USCA11 Case: 24-11396       Document: 54-1       Date Filed: 11/26/2025     Page: 6 of 10

        of and in the course of . . . employment.” ALA. CODE § 25-5-31. This
        similarity is no coincidence.
               An employer’s general liability insurance policy is designed
        to “provid[e] coverage for the employer’s liability to the general
        public” but not “for an employer’s liability for injuries to its em-
        ployees.” JORDAN R. PLITT, ET. AL., 9A COUCH ON INSURANCE
        § 129.11 (3d ed. June 2025 update). The employer’s liability exclu-
        sion preserves this distinction and prevents a “duplication of the
        coverage provided under a Workers’ Compensation and Employ-
        ers Liability policy.” MARTHA S. KERSEY, 3 NEW APPLEMAN ON
        INSURANCE LAW LIBRARY EDITION § 18.03[5] (2025). When “a word
        is obviously transplanted from another legal source, whether the
        common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it.”
        ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN GARNER, READING LAW: THE
        INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS § 6, at 73 (2012) (quoting Felix
        Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 COLUM. L.
        REV. 527, 537 (1947)). So we look to workers’ compensation
        caselaw to determine whether Babwari’s injuries “ar[ose] out of
        and in the course of . . . employment.”
                The Supreme Court of Alabama employed this approach to
        construe a similar exclusion. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Byrd, 137 So.
        2d 743, 745 (Ala. 1962) (“The obvious intent of the exclusion con-
        tained in the policy is to limit the insurer’s risk to injuries which are
        not within the purview of the workmen’s compensation stat-
        utes.”). So have federal and state courts in other jurisdictions. See,
        e.g., Ottumwa Hous. Auth. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 495 N.W.2d
USCA11 Case: 24-11396       Document: 54-1      Date Filed: 11/26/2025      Page: 7 of 10




        24-11396                Opinion of the Court                          7

        723, 727 (Iowa 1993) (“We think th[e] same meaning [as in workers’
        compensation] was intended to apply to the language ‘arising out
        of and in the course of employment’ in the employee exclusion
        clause.”); Gear Auto. v. Acceptance Indem. Ins. Co., 709 F.3d 1259, 1264
        (8th Cir. 2013) (“Because this exclusionary language is borrowed
        from Missouri’s Workers’ Compensation Act, the exclusion is
        given the same interpretation.”); Devine v. Great Divide Ins. Co., 350
        P.3d 782, 788 (Alaska 2015) (looking to “workers’ compensation
        case law to interpret the meaning of the commercial general liabil-
        ity policy’s exclusion of coverage for bodily injury ‘arising out of
        and in the course of employment’” because “commercial general
        liability policies are designed to avoid the existence of an overlap
        or a gap between workers’ compensation/employers’ liability and
        commercial general liability policies”); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.
        v. Roe, 573 N.W. 2d 628, 632 (Mich. Ct. App. 1997) (“We agree with
        plaintiff that the exclusionary language ‘arising out of his or her
        employment’ should be construed in a manner consistent with the
        worker[s’] compensation act.”).
               Alabama courts interpret “arising out of and in the course of
        employment” as a conjunctive double condition: the injury must
        both (1) “aris[e] out of” and (2) be “in the course of” employment.
        Ex parte Shelby Cnty. Health Care Auth., 850 So. 2d 332, 335–36 (Ala.
        2002). “Arising out of” employment connotes “a causal relationship
        between the claimant’s performance of his or her duties as an em-
        ployee and the complained-of injury.” Id. at 336 (citation and inter-
        nal quotation marks omitted). “In the course of” employment
        means “within the period of his employment, at a place where he
USCA11 Case: 24-11396       Document: 54-1      Date Filed: 11/26/2025      Page: 8 of 10




        8                       Opinion of the Court                  24-11396

        may reasonably be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling the duties
        of his employment or engaged in doing something incident to it.”
        Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). “The course of”
        employment is not limited to “work-related tasks” or instances
        when an employee is on the clock, but also includes “a reasonable
        time, space, and opportunity before and after [work] while [an em-
        ployee] is at or near his place of employment.” Hughes v. Decatur
        Gen. Hosp., 514 So. 2d 935, 937 (Ala. 1987).
                Both conditions apply here. Babwari’s injuries “ar[ose] out
        of” his employment because there is a causal connection between
        his employment and his injuries. Babwari was in a dark corner of
        Pit Stop’s parking lot, late at night, next to a dumpster that pro-
        vided cover for the assailant, because his employer required him to
        park there and assigned him to work the closing shift. And
        Babwari’s injuries were “in the course of” his employment because
        they occurred on employer-maintained premises while he was
        leaving work. Although injuries sustained while commuting to and
        from work generally do not occur “in the course of” employment,
        Alabama law recognizes an exception for injuries sustained imme-
        diately before or after work at “parking lot[s] owned and main-
        tained by [the] employer.” Brunson v. Lucas, 5 So. 3d 1274, 1277 (Ala.
        Civ. App. 2008). That exception extends even to certain off-prem-
        ises locations adjacent to a workplace, such as a public street be-
        tween a hospital and the hospital’s parking lot, Hughes, 514 So. 2d
        at 937, or a sidewalk immediately outside a workplace, Barnett v.
        Britling Cafeteria Co., 225 Ala. 462, 464 (1932). Babwari’s injuries un-
        disputedly occurred immediately after work while he was still on
USCA11 Case: 24-11396      Document: 54-1      Date Filed: 11/26/2025      Page: 9 of 10




        24-11396               Opinion of the Court                          9

        his employer’s premises. So they occurred “in the course of” his
        employment.
                 Babwari offers three counterarguments, but none per-
        suades. First, he argues that we should not look to workers’ com-
        pensation law because Alabama courts broadly construe employ-
        ment for workers’ compensation purposes, see Ex parte Weaver, 871
        So. 2d 820, 824 (Ala. 2003), but narrowly construe insurance policy
        exclusions, Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Thomas, 103 So. 3d 795, 805
        (Ala. 2012). But those interpretive presumptions apply only in the
        face of ambiguity. See Wakefield v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 572
        So. 2d 1220, 1223 (Ala. 1990). Pit Stop’s insurance policy unambig-
        uously transplants the meaning of “arising of out and in the course
        of . . . employment” from the workers’ compensation statute. See
        Byrd, 137 So. 2d at 745. Because the policy is “clear and unambigu-
        ous,” it “must be enforced as written.” Wakefield, 572 So. 2d at 1223.
        Second, Babwari argues that his injuries would not be compensable
        under the Alabama workers’ compensation statute because they
        were “caused by the act of a third party who intends to injure the
        employee because of reasons personal to the employee and not di-
        rected against him or her as an employee.” Ex parte N.J.J., 9 So. 3d
        455, 457 (Ala. 2008). But that rule derives from the workers’ com-
        pensation statute’s definition of “injury.” Id. (citing ALA. CODE.
        § 25-5-1(9)). Whether Babwari’s injuries satisfy other provisions of
        the workers’ compensation statute is beside the point. For our pur-
        poses, it matters only whether Babwari’s injuries “ar[ose] out of
        and in the course of . . . employment.” Finally, Babwari argues that
        we should look to respondeat superior instead of workers’
USCA11 Case: 24-11396     Document: 54-1     Date Filed: 11/26/2025   Page: 10 of 10




        10                    Opinion of the Court                24-11396

        compensation. But he does not explain why respondeat superior pro-
        vides a better framework, particularly given that the workers’ com-
        pensation statute uses nearly identical language to the policy.
                               IV. CONCLUSION
               We REVERSE the summary judgment in favor of Babwari
        and REMAND with instructions to enter summary judgment in fa-
        vor of State Farm.
