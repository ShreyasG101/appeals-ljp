                          April 8, 2025
            AFRAME, Circuit Judge.          This is an appeal from the

district court's denial of Julio Rodríguez-Méndez's ("Rodríguez")

motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.           In his motion, Rodríguez sought

relief    from   (1) his    conviction    for   felon-in-possession        of   a

firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) on double jeopardy grounds and

(2) his    sentence   for    that   offense,    which   was   based   on    the

sentencing court's conclusion that he was an armed career criminal

under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).      We reject the double jeopardy claim but

agree that Rodríguez should not have been sentenced as an armed

career criminal.

                                BACKGROUND

            In November 2004, Rodríguez participated in a carjacking

in Puerto Rico while possessing a firearm.          That conduct resulted

in successive prosecutions in the Puerto Rico Commonwealth courts

and the United States District Court for the District of Puerto

Rico.     Rodríguez was first prosecuted in a Commonwealth court for

robbery of a motor vehicle in violation Article 173B of the Puerto

Rico Penal Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33 § 4279b (repealed 2004),

and for carrying a weapon without a license in violation of Article

5.04 of the Puerto Rico Weapons Law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 25, § 458c

(repealed 2013).      Rodríguez pleaded guilty and was sentenced to

twelve years in prison.

            Following the Commonwealth conviction, a federal grand

jury indicted Rodríguez on three counts arising from the same


                                    - 2 -
carjacking: aiding and abetting a carjacking, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and

2119; aiding and abetting the use of a firearm during and in

relation to a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 924(c); and

unlawful      possession        of      a     firearm      by    a         felon

("felon-in-possession"), 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).1

In addition, because he had at least three prior convictions for

robbery of a motor vehicle in violation of Article 173B, Rodríguez

was charged as an armed career criminal pursuant to the Armed

Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) [hereinafter ACCA or the

Act].2

            Rodríguez   pleaded      guilty   to   the   felon-in-possession

count and the government dismissed the other charges.                 He was

sentenced in November 2006.          Due in part to the ACCA's heightened

statutory    penalties,     Rodríguez         received     216   months      of

imprisonment.     Rodríguez filed a notice of appeal but voluntarily

dismissed   the   appeal   in     October     2008.      Rodríguez   did    not


     1    When Rodríguez was indicted, the penalty provision for
§ 922(g) was § 924(a)(2). "The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,
Pub. L. No. 117-159, § 12004, 136 Stat. 1313, 1329 (2022), has
since moved the penalty provision . . . to [§] 924(a)(8), which
provides   for  a   longer  maximum   period  of  imprisonment."
United States v. Minor, 63 F.4th 112, 118 n.4 (1st Cir. 2023).
All subsequent references to § 924(a)(2) are to the provision as
it existed at the time of the indictment.
     2    The presentence investigation report identified the ACCA
predicates as convictions for armed robbery under Article 173 of
the Puerto Rico Penal Code.        The parties agree that the
convictions, in fact, were for robbery of a motor vehicle in
violation of Article 173B.

collaterally attack his conviction within a year of it becoming

final.

            Two significant legal developments followed.                   In June

2015,    roughly    a    decade       after   Rodríguez's     felon-in-possession

conviction, the United States Supreme Court held that the residual

clause of the ACCA was unconstitutionally vague.                        Johnson v.

United States (Johnson II), 576 U.S. 591, 597 (2015).

            Then, a year later, in June 2016, the Supreme Court held

that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States are one

sovereign for double jeopardy purposes, thereby barring successive

prosecutions for the same offense in Commonwealth and federal

courts.    Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. 59, 78 (2016).

            About       three    months    after   the   Supreme   Court   decided

Sánchez Valle, Rodríguez filed a pro se motion for habeas relief

under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 seeking to vacate his felon-in-possession

conviction on double jeopardy grounds.                  After the appointment of

counsel,   Rodríguez       amended      his   motion     to   challenge   his   ACCA

enhancement, arguing that following Johnson II, his three prior

Article 173B convictions no longer qualified as predicate offenses

under the ACCA.

            The district court rejected both claims.                 It held that

double      jeopardy            did     not       bar     Rodríguez's      federal

felon-in-possession prosecution because Rodríguez "failed to meet

the stone set privity requirement necessary for his double jeopardy


                                          - 4 -
claim to thrive."      It also held that even after Johnson II, an

Article 173B conviction constitutes an ACCA predicate because the

offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened

use of physical force as defined by the ACCA.         The district court

concluded that was so because Article 173B requires a defendant to

commit motor vehicle robbery using "an object capable of causing

grave bodily injury."     The district court denied certificates of

appealability on both claims.       Rodríguez appealed, and this Court

granted him the required certificates.

                               DOUBLE JEOPARDY

            On appeal, the government does not argue privity but

instead proffers two alternative bases to affirm the district

court's double jeopardy ruling.        See Miller v. United States, 77

F.4th 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2023) (stating that this Court may affirm the

denial of § 2255 relief on "any ground made manifest in the

record").   First, the government contends that Rodríguez's § 2255

double jeopardy claim fails because Sánchez Valle does not apply

retroactively.    Second, it argues that, even if Sánchez Valle is

retroactive,   the    double    jeopardy   claim   fails   because    under

Blockburger      v.    United States,      284     U.S.    299       (1932),

felon-in-possession under federal law and carrying a gun without

a license under Puerto Rico law are different offenses for double

jeopardy purposes.




                                   - 5 -
            We agree with the government's Blockburger argument.                    We

therefore      assume      without     deciding        that      Sánchez Valle      is

retroactive.     See, e.g., Goodrich v. Hall, 448 F.3d 45, 49 (1st

Cir. 2006) ("[W]here a habeas petition can easily be denied on

other grounds, there is no need to do a Teague analysis first.").

            "The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment [to

the   United     States      Constitution]         prohibits      more     than   one

prosecution for the 'same offence'" where the prosecution is

brought by the same sovereign.          United States v. Reyes-Correa, 971

F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2020)              (alteration in original)              (quoting

Sánchez Valle,       579   U.S.   at   62).        A    state    and   the   federal

government,     as     separate   sovereigns,          may    successively    try   a

defendant for the same offense without violating double jeopardy.

Id.; see also Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, 681 (2019)

(describing the "dual-sovereignty" doctrine).                  This rule, however,

does not apply to successive prosecutions brought by the United

States and Puerto Rico because they are one sovereign for double

jeopardy purposes.         See Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. at 78.              Thus, the

United States and Puerto Rico "may not 'successively prosecute a

single defendant for the same'" offense.                 Reyes-Correa, 971 F.3d

at 9 (quoting Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. at 62).

            After       Sánchez Valle,        we       must     consider     whether

Rodríguez's      convictions -- the            federal         felon-in-possession

conviction     under    § 922(g)(1)     and    the      Puerto    Rico   unlicensed


                                       - 6 -
carrying of a firearm conviction under Article 5.04 -- represent

convictions for the same offense.        There is no dispute that both

convictions stem from Rodríguez's gun possession during the same

2004 carjacking.    But the double jeopardy clause does not bar

successive prosecutions for separate offenses merely because they

arise from the same conduct.     See United States v. Morris, 99 F.3d

476, 479 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting "the defendant may be prosecuted

consecutively . . . even if the crimes arise out of the same

conduct or nucleus of operative facts").           Under Blockburger,

successive prosecutions by the same sovereign for the same conduct

are permissible so long as the offenses require proving different

elements.3   See United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696 (1993)

("The    same-elements   test,    sometimes    referred   to   as   the

'Blockburger' test, inquires whether each offense contains an

element not contained in the other; if not, they are the 'same

offence' and double jeopardy bars . . . successive prosecution.").


     3    In asserting his double jeopardy claim, Rodríguez at
points emphasizes that his two convictions rely on the same
underlying evidence. To the extent Rodríguez is arguing that the
two counts are not separate offenses because they rely on the same
evidence, that is incorrect. "[T]he Blockburger rule depends on
statutory analysis, not on evidentiary comparisons."        United
States v. Morris, 99 F.3d 476, 479 (1st Cir. 1996); see also
United States v. Lanoue, 137 F.3d 656, 661 (1st Cir. 1998) ("The
Blockburger test looks to the elements of each offense rather than
to the evidence used to prove these elements."); United States v.
Sepulveda, 102 F.3d 1313, 1316 (1st Cir. 1996) ("[A] defendant can
be convicted of two differently defined offenses, based on the
same core of facts, so long as each offense requires an element
that the other does not.").


                                 - 7 -
          This Court has previously applied Blockburger to the two

relevant offenses here.     In United States v. Almonte-Núñez, we

held that for double jeopardy purposes, "the federal § 922(g)

offense and the Commonwealth Article 5.04 offense are separate

offenses because each offense requires an element of proof that

the other does not."      963 F.3d 58, 70 (1st Cir. 2020) (citing

Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304). We explained that "[s]ection 922(g)

does not require a showing that the defendant [was without] a

license, and Article 5.04 does not require proof that the defendant

was a prohibited person [because of a prior felony] or that the

firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce."   Id.   We follow

this precedent here.4   See United States v. Walker-Couvertier, 860

F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2017) (stating that "in a multi-panel circuit,

a new panel is 'bound by prior panel decisions that are closely on


     4    Rodríguez asks that we consider his double jeopardy
argument without relying on Almonte-Núñez because there, despite
performing a full Blockburger analysis, we considered the
defendant's double jeopardy claim only on plain error review. We
decline. Almonte-Núñez turned on the first prong of plain error
review, whether the district court erred. See 963 F.3d at 69-70;
see also United States v. Pérez Rodríguez, 13 F.4th 1, 16 (1st
Cir. 2021) (stating that the first prong of plain error review
requires the defendant to show that "an error occurred"). This
threshold inquiry -- was there legal error -- is identical to our
inquiry here. Cf. United States v. Duquette, 778 F.3d 314, 317
n.3 (1st Cir. 2015) (noting that where defendant "is unable to
demonstrate any error -- plain or otherwise -- . . . it makes no
difference . . . whether we apply de novo or plain error review").
The holding in Almonte-Núñez is therefore directly on point.
Moreover, were we to consider Rodríguez's double jeopardy claim
from scratch, we would reach the same conclusion for the reasons
described above.


                               - 8 -
point'" (quoting San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel. Co., 612 F.3d 25,

33 (1st Cir. 2010))).

          Indeed,      Rodríguez     does   not      seriously    contest

Almonte-Núñez's   elements   analysis.      Rather,   he   contends    that

Blockburger should not be applied to his case in the usual manner.

He first suggests that we should not apply Blockburger "in a rigid

fashion" because the successive prosecutions at issue here involve

criminal statutes passed by different legislative bodies -- the

Puerto Rico legislature and Congress.        He subsequently contends

that even if "the language" used in § 922(g)(1) and Article 5.04

"may be slightly different," the two statutes share the same "foci

and elements" insofar as both laws "prevent specific individuals

from obtaining or possessing weapons."

          We decline Rodríguez's invitation to modify Blockburger

for   purposes    of    evaluating    his   double     jeopardy    claim.

Post-Sánchez Valle, we have faithfully applied             Blockburger   to

address double jeopardy claims involving successive Commonwealth

and federal prosecutions.          See Reyes-Correa, 971 F.3d at 9;

Almonte-Núñez, 963 F.3d at 69.         We do so again here.           Under

Blockburger, to determine whether the sovereign intended to create

separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes, we do not compare

the "foci" or the general thrust of statutes. Instead, "we examine

whether each offense 'requires proof of an additional fact which

the other does not.'"     United States v. Gerhard, 615 F.3d 7, 18


                                   - 9 -
(1st Cir. 2010) (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304).                                As we

explained in Almonte-Núñez, Article 5.04 and § 922(g)(1) contain

distinct    elements      and    are    thus       separate       offenses    for      double

jeopardy purposes.        963 F.3d at 70.               The district court therefore

properly denied Rodríguez's § 2255 motion insofar as it alleges a

double jeopardy violation.

                            ARMED CAREER CRIMINAL

            Having concluded that Rodríguez was properly convicted

under § 922(g)(1), we turn to whether he was lawfully sentenced as

an armed career criminal.                   The ACCA increases the otherwise

applicable    statutory         penalties         for    unlawful       possession      of   a

firearm,     § 922(g),     to     a     range       of     fifteen       years    to    life

imprisonment.          Compare         18     U.S.C.           § 924(e)(1)       (requiring

fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence for a felon-in-possession

conviction    and    an   ACCA     finding),            with    18   U.S.C.   § 924(a)(2)

(requiring a ten-year statutory maximum for the same offense absent

an   ACCA   finding).           Someone      convicted          under    § 922(g)       faces

ACCA-enhanced       penalties      if       the    person        "has    three    previous

convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,

or both, committed on occasions different from one another."                              Id.

§ 924(e)(1); see also United States v. Whindleton, 797 F.3d 105,

108 (1st Cir. 2015) (same).

            Rodríguez received a substantially enhanced sentence of

216 months because the sentencing court determined that the ACCA


                                        - 10 -
applied.     To    make   this    determination,        the   sentencing   court

considered Rodríguez's prior convictions for motor vehicle robbery

under Article 173B of the Puerto Rico Penal Code.                     Following

Rodríguez's § 2255 motion contesting the ACCA enhancement, the

district court reviewed the Article 173B convictions and held that

the   sentencing     court     correctly      found   that    the   convictions

qualified as predicate offenses under the ACCA.                  Rodríguez now

challenges that determination, which we consider de novo.                     See

Whindleton, 797 F.3d at 108 ("Whether a prior conviction qualifies

as an ACCA predicate offense is a legal question we review de

novo.").

            We begin by describing the legal framework.               After the

Supreme    Court's    ruling     that   the    ACCA's    residual    clause   is

unconstitutional, Johnson II, 576 U.S. at 606, there remain two

ways for a crime to meet the ACCA's definition of a violent felony.

The first is the so-called force clause, which counts a past

conviction as a violent felony if the offense of conviction "has

as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical

force against the person of another." 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i).

The second is the so-called enumerated offense clause, which

qualifies an offense as a violent felony if, inter alia, the

offense     "is      burglary,      arson,       or     extortion."           Id.

§ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).




                                    - 11 -
            To decide whether a particular offense qualifies as an

ACCA violent felony under either the force clause or the enumerated

offense    clause,     we     employ    a      "categorical      approach."         See

United States v. Báez-Martínez, 950 F.3d 119, 124 (1st Cir. 2020)

(applying a categorical approach to determine whether a felony

qualifies under the force clause); Mathis v. United States, 579

U.S. 500, 504 (2016) (applying a categorical approach to determine

whether a felony qualifies under the enumerated offense clause).

The categorical approach requires courts to confine their analysis

to   the   legal    elements    of     the     prior    conviction    and    not    the

conviction's "specific facts."               United States v. Bain, 874 F.3d 1,

29 (1st Cir. 2017).

            In     applying    the     categorical       approach    to   the   force

clause,    a     sentencing     court       asks     "whether    a   state    offense

necessarily      involves     the    defendant's       'use,    attempted    use,    or

threatened use of physical force against the person of another.'"

Borden v. United States, 593 U.S. 420, 424 (2021) (emphasis added)

(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i)).                  "[P]hysical force" under

the ACCA refers to "violent force -- that is, force capable of

causing physical pain or injury to another person."                   United States

v. Hudson, 823 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir. 2016) (quoting Johnson v.

United States      (Johnson I),        559    U.S.     133,   140,   (2010)).       "If

any -- even the least culpable -- of the acts criminalized do not

entail [using physical force against another person] the statute


                                        - 12 -
of conviction does not categorically match the [ACCA] standard,

and so cannot serve as an ACCA predicate."     Borden, 593 U.S. at

424 (citing Johnson I, 559 U.S. at 137).

          When applying the categorical approach to the enumerated

offense clause, a sentencing court first discerns the generic

version of the charged offense.   Mathis, 579 U.S. at 503-04.     The

court next identifies the elements of the generic offense -- what

the "prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction."      Id. at 504

(quoting Black's Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014)).          After

identifying those elements, the court decides if the elements of

the crime of conviction "are the same as, or narrower than, those

of the generic offense."    Id.   If so, the crime of conviction

qualifies as an ACCA violent felony.        See id. (applying the

categorical approach to the enumerated offense of burglary).    "But

if the crime of conviction covers any more conduct than the generic

offense, then it is not an ACCA [enumerated offense] -- even if

the defendant's actual conduct (i.e., the facts of the crime) fits

within the generic offense's boundaries."   Id.

          As mentioned, Rodríguez's relevant prior convictions

were for robbery of a motor vehicle under Article 173B.     See tit.

33, § 4279b.   The statute provides:

          Any person who, using an object capable of
          causing grave bodily injury, unlawfully
          appropriates him or herself of a motor vehicle
          belonging to another, taking it away from the
          person, or from the person in whose possession


                              - 13 -
            it is at the time, in his/her immediate
            presence and against his/her will, through the
            use of violence or intimidation, shall be
            sanctioned with a fixed term of imprisonment
            of eighteen (18) years.
Id.
            Under this statute, a person violates Article 173B by

appropriating a motor vehicle "through the use of violence or

intimidation."    Id.     There is no dispute that the statutory phrase

"violence    or   intimidation"    represents    a   single,   indivisible

offense element.    See Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 258

(2013) (describing an indivisible statute as "one not containing

alternative elements" and thus not defining multiple crimes).

Otherwise stated, violence or intimidation are merely different

means, i.e., "factual ways" of committing the element.             Mathis,

579 U.S. at 506.     Hence, for Article 173B to qualify as an ACCA

predicate pursuant to the categorical approach, every way of

engaging in "violence or intimidation" must also satisfy the ACCA's

definition of violent felony.        Put differently, if there is some

way of committing "violence or intimidation" under Article 173B

that does not qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA, then any

prior   Article    173B    conviction   does   not   constitute   an   ACCA

predicate.    See Borden, 593 U.S. at 424.




                                   - 14 -
           We can resolve Rodríguez's ACCA argument by looking just

to the meaning of the term "intimidation" under Article 173B.5

Under the force clause, the court asks, "whether a state offense

necessarily   involves     the    defendant's     'use,   attempted      use,   or

threatened use of physical force against the person of another.'"

Borden,    593     U.S      at         424   (emphasis     added)     (quoting

§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i)).      Intimidation directed at a person can satisfy

the force clause because it may constitute "threatened use of

physical   force   against       the    person   of   another."     18    U.S.C.

§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i); see also United States v. Ellison, 866 F.3d 32,

35, 37 (1st Cir. 2017) (finding federal bank robbery qualifies

under the United States Sentencing Guidelines' definition of crime

of violence pursuant to § 4B1.2(a)(2) -- which tracks the ACCA's

definition of violent felony -- because it "has as an element 'the

. . . threatened use of physical force against the person of

another'" (quoting U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a) (Nov. 1, 2015))).

           Puerto Rico law, however, does not limit intimidation to

threatened use of force against the "person of another." 18 U.S.C.

§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i).       Rather, pursuant to Article 174, intimidation

also includes threats against property.               See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.

33, § 4280 (repealed 2004).        The definition of intimidation -- set



     5    For this reason, we need not consider the parties'
dispute as to whether Article 173B offenses involving violence
meet the ACCA's definition of a violent felony.


                                       - 15 -
forth in Article 174 and applicable to Article 173B -- is therefore

broader than the force clause's ambit.               Consequently, Article 173B

does not qualify as an ACCA predicate under that clause.                         See

United States v. Hatley, 61 F.4th 536, 538-39 (7th Cir. 2023)

(stating that "using force against property [] does not fit within

[the] ACCA's force clause" as that clause "only provides for

committing force against persons, not property").

           The government makes two arguments in response.                   First,

it contends that because Article 173B requires a perpetrator to

"us[e] an object capable of causing grave bodily injury," any

threat of physical force against property also constitutes a threat

of physical force against the person present for the robbery.                    The

government cites no authority for this proposition, and we are

unpersuaded.      To qualify as an ACCA predicate, an offense must

involve   a     threat      of   force    against     a    person.      18   U.S.C.

§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i).          The mere presence of a dangerous object does

not, without more, transform every threat against property into a

threat against a person.            Cf. United States v. Starks, 861 F.3d

306, 321-24 (1st Cir. 2017) (stating that Massachusetts armed

robbery   was    not   an    ACCA   violent       felony   in   part   because   the

Massachusetts statute did not require the perpetrator to use the

dangerous weapon to commit the offense); accord United States v.

Parnell, 818 F.3d 974, 980-81 (9th Cir. 2016) ("The mere possession




                                         - 16 -
of a weapon . . . does not bring Massachusetts' armed robbery

statute within [the] ACCA's force clause.").

            The government alternatively argues that a carjacking

arising from threats to property constitutes extortion and thus

qualifies as a generic crime under the enumerated offense clause.

The government properly defines extortion as an offense that forces

the victim to part with property by induced consent.              It posits

that these same elements are present in Article 173B because

Article 173B requires a perpetrator to take the victim's car

"against his/her will."       In both cases, the government argues, the

victim "acquiesces in the face of the intimidation."                 As such,

according    to    the   government,   "Article     173B   robbery     through

intimidation fits squarely into [the extortion] box."

            We disagree. The Supreme Court has described the generic

definition of extortion as "obtaining something of value from

another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force,

fear, or threats."        Scheidler v. Nat'l Org. for Women, Inc., 537

U.S. 393, 409 (2003) (quoting United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S.

286, 290 (1969)).        "The generic definition of extortion . . . and

the    [federal]    Hobbs   Act   definition   of   extortion    are   nearly

identical."       United States v. Kirsch, 903 F.3d 213, 225-26 (2d

Cir. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).               Resultingly, we

have   considered    decisions    "involving   Hobbs   Act    extortion    'as

persuasive analogous authority'" in evaluating whether a state


                                    - 17 -
statute    constitutes    generic       extortion.       United States     v.

Muñoz-Martínez,     79   F.4th    44,   53     (1st   Cir.   2023)   (quoting

United States v. Saccoccia, 354 F.3d 9, 12 n.2 (1st Cir. 2003)).

           In the analogous Hobbs Act context, we have observed

that "[c]onsent is 'the razor's edge that distinguishes extortion

from robbery.'"      Muñoz Martínez, 79 F.4th at 53 (alteration in

original) (quoting United States v. Burhoe, 871 F.3d 1, 28 (1st

Cir. 2017)).      As the Supreme Court explained, "the phrase 'with

his consent' is designed to distinguish extortion ('obtaining of

property   from     another,     with    his    consent,')    from    robbery

('obtaining of personal property from the person or in the presence

of another, against his will')."             Ocasio v. United States, 578

U.S. 282, 297 (2016) (internal citations omitted) (first quoting

18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2); and then quoting § 1951(b)(1)). It follows

that extortion's essential feature that differentiates it from

robbery "is [] that the victim retained some degree of choice in

whether to comply with the extortionate threat, [no matter how]

much of a Hobson's choice that may [have been]."             Muñoz-Martínez,

79 F.4th at 53 (quoting Burhoe, 871 F.3d at 28) (first alteration

in original).

           Applied here, it is unclear why Article 173B carjacking

achieved via intimidation toward property using a dangerous object

would invariably require a victim's "grudging consent" such that

it would constitute extortion.            See Ocasio, 578 U.S. at 297.


                                   - 18 -
Although    a    victim       could       be   forced      to    consent     through       such

intimidation,         that    is    not    always    so.         In   the    face    of    such

intimidation,         a    victim    could     choose      to    resist      and    thus     the

perpetrator      would       have    appropriated          the     vehicle    without      the

victim's consent.            Accordingly, not all ways of violating Article

173B constitute generic extortion.                      See id. (noting that as to

"the Hobbs Act, the phrase 'with his consent' is designed to

distinguish extortion") (quoting U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2)).

            In so holding, we diverge from other circuits that have

concluded that the line between induced consent and a taking

against someone's will is so fine as to be meaningless.                            See, e.g.,

Hatley,    61    F.4th        at    539    ("In     our    view,      generic       extortion

encompasses Hobbs Act robbery using force against property.");

United States v. Castillo, 811 F.3d 342, 348 (10th Cir. 2015) ("We

see no meaningful difference in this context between a taking of

property accomplished against the victim's will and one where the

victim's consent is obtained through force or threats.").

            As we describe above, the categorical approach demands

that we compare the elements of a generic offense against the

elements of the crime of conviction.                       Mathis, 579 U.S. at 504.

Here, generic extortion requires an element of induced consent.

See Scheidler, 537 U.S. at 409.                   But Article 173B does not.                   A

defendant       may       employ    intimidation          toward      property      during    a

carjacking, but a conviction under Article 173B does not require


                                           - 19 -
the victim's consent to the taking of the vehicle.          Thus, Article

173B "sweeps more broadly than [a] generic crime" of extortion.

Descamps, 570 U.S. at 261; see also Raines v. United States, 898

F.3d 680, 689-90 (6th Cir. 2018) (explaining that an offense that

"'involves the non-consensual taking of money or property from

another' cannot qualify as a generic extortion crime because it

does not involve a taking with the victim's induced consent"

(quoting United States v. Gardner, 823 F.3d 793, 802 n.5 (4th Cir.

2016))).    Article 173B therefore cannot be an ACCA predicate under

the enumerated offense clause.

            Taken together, the above discussion reveals a mismatch

between (1) the broad definition of "intimidation" under Article

173B and (2) the requirements for an offense to constitute an ACCA

predicate.    Under Article 173B, someone could rob a motor vehicle

through "intimidation" using an object capable of causing grave

bodily injury in ways that neither require threats of physical

force against a person nor represent a generic offense under

§ 924(e).      18   U.S.C.   § 924(e)(2)(B)(i-ii).          Applying    the

categorical   approach,   Article   173B   is   therefore   not   an   ACCA

predicate, and Rodríguez was thus unlawfully subjected to the ACCA

sentencing enhancements for his § 922(g)(1) conviction.6


     6    Rodríguez makes a separate argument that because Article
173B can be violated based on a mens rea of recklessness, there
are ways to violate Article 173B that are not violent felonies



                                - 20 -
                                CONCLUSION

            Blockburger and the ACCA's categorical approach each

share a focus on statutory elements rather than a defendant's

actual conduct.      This split decision demonstrates that at certain

times an elements-focus benefits the defendant and at other times

it benefits the government.      Here, Rodríguez's felon-in-possession

conviction    did     not    violate    double    jeopardy      because   the

Commonwealth's       firearm-license      offense      and     the     federal

felon-in-possession offense contain different elements.                At the

same time, Rodríguez was wrongly sentenced under the ACCA for his

felon-in-possession offense because the elements of Article 173B

do   not   satisfy   the    ACCA's   definition   of   a     violent   felony.

Accordingly, we reverse the denial of Rodríguez's § 2255 motion

insofar as it seeks vacatur of his felon-in-possession sentence.

We otherwise affirm.




pursuant to the ACCA. We do not reach this argument because we
have resolved the ACCA question favorably to Rodríguez on other
grounds.
