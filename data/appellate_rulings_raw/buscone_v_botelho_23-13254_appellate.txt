                    IN RE: MARY E. BUSCONE,

                              Debtor.


                          MARY E. BUSCONE,

                            Appellant,

          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

          [Hon. Julia E. Kobick, U.S. District Judge]


                              Before

                   Aframe, Lynch, and Howard,
                        Circuit Judges.


    David G. Baker on brief for appellant.

     Michael B. Feinman    and Feinman Law    Office on   brief for
appellee.


                           April 2, 2025
            PER CURIAM.    Chapter 13 debtor-appellant Mary E. Buscone

appeals from an order rejecting her objection to a proof of claim

for a Massachusetts state-court judgment that Buscone owes to

appellee Ann Tracy Botelho.           Through an adversary proceeding in

Buscone's    previous     Chapter     7        bankruptcy,    Botelho    sought    a

determination that her judgment against Buscone was excepted from

discharge under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(4).                     Because of

discovery abuse by Buscone and her counsel in that proceeding, the

bankruptcy court entered default judgment for Botelho.                   Now in her

second bankruptcy, this time under Chapter 13, Buscone objects to

Botelho's proof of claim for that debt on the same grounds raised

previously and, alternatively, asserts that the interest rate and

accrual date prescribed by Massachusetts state law should not apply

to the Massachusetts state-court judgment.                 We affirm.

                                          I.

            The   facts     of      Buscone's        and     Botelho's     business

relationship as well as their ensuing bankruptcies and litigation

are detailed in a prior opinion by this court on appeal of the

Chapter 7 judgment, see Botelho v. Buscone (In re Buscone), 61

F.4th 10, 16-20 (1st Cir. 2023), and by the district court in the

instant   case,   see     Buscone    v.    Botelho     (In    re   Buscone),      No.

23-cv-13254, 2024 WL 3744547, at *1-3 (D. Mass. Aug. 9, 2024).                    We

briefly recount the facts essential to this appeal.




                                      - 2 -
            Buscone    and    Botelho     were   partners      in   a    now-defunct

frozen yogurt business from May 2012 until January 2014.                      Botelho,

61 F.4th at 16-17.          Botelho later sued Buscone in Massachusetts

state court, alleging various causes of action pertaining to their

business relationship.         Id. at 17 & n.6.        When Buscone failed to

respond to the suit, Botelho obtained a default judgment against

her in the amount of $91,673.45 "plus all interest and costs due

thereunder."       Id. at 17, 32.

            Shortly       thereafter,     Buscone      filed    for      Chapter    7

bankruptcy relief.          Id. at 17.      Botelho initiated an adversary

proceeding against her, seeking a determination that the state-

court    judgment     was    nondischargeable       pursuant        to   11    U.S.C.

§ 523(a)(2)(A) and (a)(4). Id. Ultimately, because of significant

discovery misconduct by Buscone and her counsel, David G. Baker,

the bankruptcy court awarded default judgment to Botelho.                      Id. at

18-19.   We affirmed on appeal.           Id. at 36.

            After Buscone subsequently initiated the instant Chapter

13 bankruptcy proceeding, Botelho filed a proof of claim for the

state-court judgment debt excepted from the Chapter 7 proceeding,

which she tabulated at $145,140.42 -- the principal value of the

original judgment plus $53,466.97 in accumulated post-judgment

interest.    Buscone objected, raising a previous judicial-estoppel

argument    from    the     Chapter   7   proceeding     and,       alternatively,

asserting that Botelho's interest calculation was wrong.                        As to


                                      - 3 -
the latter, Buscone contended that interest should accrue on the

judgment debt at the federal rate for civil money judgments, see

28 U.S.C. § 1961, and only as of the issuance of the bankruptcy

court's default judgment in the Chapter 7 proceeding, which would

amount to $257.44 by Buscone's calculations.              The bankruptcy court

overruled Buscone's objection on both bases, and the district court

affirmed.     Buscone,    2024    WL    3744547,    at    *5-6.     This   appeal

followed.

clear error and its conclusions of law de novo."                       Zizza v.

Harrington (In re Zizza), 875 F.3d 728, 731 (1st Cir. 2017).

"Notwithstanding    the    fact        that    we   are   the     second-in-time

reviewers, we cede no special deference to the district court's

determinations."   Premier Cap., LLC v. Crawford (In re Crawford),

841 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2016) (quoting Gannett v. Carp (In re

Carp), 340 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2003)).

Santiago-Martínez v. Fundación Damas, Inc., 93 F.4th 47, 51 (1st

Cir. 2024).   Determinations of the rate and accrual date of post-

judgment interest are likewise reviewed without deference.                    See

Fratus v. Republic W. Ins. Co., 147 F.3d 25, 30 & n.5 (1st Cir.

1998).

                                 III.

            Buscone reiterates the same two arguments to us that she

unsuccessfully advanced before the district court: (1) that her

judicial-estoppel argument is not precluded by the bankruptcy

court's default judgment against her in the Chapter 7 proceeding;

and (2) that any post-judgment interest on the state-court judgment

debt should accrue at the federal (as opposed to state) rate from

the date on which the bankruptcy court's default judgment issued

(as opposed to the date on which the state court's default judgment

did).   See Buscone, 2024 WL 3744547, at *4-6.           We reject each

argument.

                                  A.

            Buscone   first   challenges    the     bankruptcy   court's

conclusion that she is precluded from raising the same affirmative

defense to Botelho's proof of claim that she asserted in her motion

to   dismiss   Botelho's   adversary   proceeding   in   the   Chapter    7

bankruptcy.    She notes that, in her first bankruptcy proceeding,

the court never reached the merits of her defense, and therefore,

she argues, it "has never been litigated."

            Four   elements    must    generally    be   satisfied       to

collaterally estop a party from relitigating a factual or legal

issue in federal court: "(1) the issue sought to be precluded must

be the same as that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue

must have been actually litigated; (3) the issue must have been


                                 - 5 -
determined by a valid and binding final judgment; and (4) the

determination   of    the   issue   must    have   been    essential    to   the

judgment."    Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30

(1st Cir. 1994).        The second, "actual-litigation" element is

usually unattainable when the prior action resulted in a default

judgment, as a default does not require actual litigation of any

of the issues raised.       See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27

cmt. e (1982) ("In the case of a judgment entered by . . . default,

none of the issues is actually litigated.                  Therefore, [issue

preclusion]   does    not   apply   with    respect   to    any   issue   in   a

subsequent action.").

          We join numerous other circuits in applying an exception

to this rule: where the default judgment was entered as a sanction

for the estopped litigant's misconduct, and that litigant had the

opportunity   to     participate    in   the   case   before      the   default

judgment's entry, the default judgment has preclusive effect.                See

Murphy v. Snyder, (In re Snyder), 939 F.3d 92, 100-01 (2d Cir.

2019); Wolstein v. Docteroff (In re Docteroff), 133 F.3d 210, 215

(3d Cir. 1997); Cornwell v. Loesch (In re Cornwell), 109 F. App'x

1324-25 (11th Cir. 1995); see also 18A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur

A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4442 (3d ed. 1998) ("A

'default' entered as a procedural sanction also may support issue

preclusion in closely related litigation in order to further the

purposes of the sanction. . . . To deny preclusion would be to

encourage . . . obstructive tactics.").       Indeed, this exception is

already widely applied by our bankruptcy courts under federal and

Massachusetts issue-preclusion law.      See, e.g., Gray v. Tacason

(In re Tacason), 537 B.R. 41, 51-54 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 2015); Acevedo

v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (In re Acevedo), No. 10-43723, 2015 WL

1876857, at *3-4 (Bankr. D. Mass. Apr. 21, 2015); D'Amour v.

Birchall (In re Birchall), 501 B.R. 142, 149 (Bankr. D. Mass.

2013); Backlund v. Stanley-Snow, 405 B.R. 11, 19-21 (B.A.P. 1st

Cir. 2009); Int'l Strategies Grp., Ltd. v. Pomeroy (In re Pomeroy),

353 B.R. 371, 377 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2006); see also McHeffey v.

Pereira (In re Pereira), 428 B.R. 276, 281-82 & n.30 (Bankr. D.

Mass. 2010) (citing standard approvingly without applying).

           Here, the default judgment that the bankruptcy court

entered against Buscone in the Chapter 7 proceeding is of precisely

the kind contemplated by this exception. As we noted, this default

judgment   was   the   bankruptcy   court's    last   resort,   rendered

necessary by Buscone and Baker's "failure to provide any creditable

argument for not complying with the court's first [discovery]


                                - 7 -
order,    repeated    failures    to    respond    to    discovery      requests,

attempts to obfuscate issues before the court, and continued

noncompliance despite the fact that the court had already imposed

the lesser sanction of shifting fees." Botelho, 61 F.4th at 30-31.

Such blatant recalcitrance throughout discovery easily satisfies

the first element of this exception, the litigant's misconduct.1

See   Snyder,   939   F.3d   at   98,     101   (applying    exception     where

defendants first failed to respond to discovery requests, then

served "inadequate responses" following the plaintiffs' motion to

compel).    As to the second element, the litigant's opportunity to

participate,    there   is   no   question      that    Buscone   had    such   an

opportunity in the Chapter 7 proceeding, as demonstrated by her

and Baker's filing of the motion to dismiss, challenging the


      1We note that courts have applied this exception where the
misconduct was less severe than the conduct at issue here. See
Herbstein, 266 B.R. at 679-81 (estopped party refused to comply
with a single discovery order "because of their inability to
assemble and prepare the [necessary]         information without
professional accounting assistance" and the state court provided
a single warning before entering a default judgment); Daily, 47
F.3d at 368 ("[T]he 'actual litigation' requirement may be
satisfied by substantial participation in an adversary contest in
which the party is afforded a reasonable opportunity to defend
himself on the merits but chooses not to do so."); Cornwell, 109
F. App'x at 684 (preceding judgment need only be "a post-answer
default entered as a sanction for discovery violations"); Murphy,
939 F.3d at 100 ("[W]here the default judgment is entered as a
sanction for bad conduct, and the party being estopped had the
opportunity to participate in the underlying litigation, the
default judgment has preclusive effect . . . .").       Given the
egregiousness of the misconduct in this case, we need not discern
a minimum standard of misconduct that would support application of
the exception.

bankruptcy      court's    first   round       of    sanctions,    and    providing

"arguably sarcastic and evasive responses to interrogatories."

Botelho,   61    F.4th    at   18-19,    29.        We   accordingly     agree   that

Buscone's conduct warrants application of this exception to the

actual-litigation requirement, and she is therefore estopped from

reasserting the affirmative defense she raised in the Chapter 7

proceeding again in the present case.

                                         B.

           In     the     alternative,        Buscone     argues   that     Botelho

miscalculated      the     post-judgment            interest   accrued      on    the

state-court judgment against her.              Rather than apply the rate set

by Massachusetts law as of the state-court judgment's entry as

dictated by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, §§ 6B, 6C, 6H and ch. 235,

§ 8, Buscone insists that the post-judgment interest on the debt

must be calculated according to the federal rate under 28 U.S.C.

§ 1961 and as of the bankruptcy court's entry of default judgment

in the Chapter 7 proceeding.            This attempt to reduce the value of

Botelho's claim is unavailing.

           As we acknowledged in her last appeal, see id. at 34-35,

we concur with the conclusion reached by other courts that interest

accrues on a valid pre-petition judgment obtained in state court

at the rate set by state law from the date of the judgment's entry.

See Hamilton v. Elite of L.A., Inc. (In re Hamilton), 584 B.R.

310, 322-25 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2018), aff'd, 785 F. App'x 438 (9th


                                        - 9 -
Cir. 2019) (unpublished); cf. Old Republic Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v.

Levasseur (In re Levasseur), 737 F.3d 814, 817 (1st Cir. 2013)

(finding "no error" in bankruptcy court's determination that pre-

petition judgment, subject to post-judgment interest accrual set

by Massachusetts state court, is excepted from discharge).                    In

this case, Botelho's claim plainly arises from the judgment that

she obtained against Buscone in Massachusetts state court.                   When

Botelho   subsequently      brought    the     adversary   proceeding   in   the

Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court "incorporated and gave

effect to the state court judgment and the language regarding [the]

interest rate," addressing only the preexisting judgment debt's

dischargeability.      In    so limiting its         ruling,   the   Chapter 7

bankruptcy court did not displace the state-court judgment with

one under federal law or otherwise impose a new money judgment on

Buscone from which Botelho's claim could be construed to arise.

Thus, the post-judgment interest rate under Massachusetts state

law continues to apply to the judgment debt, accruing as of the

entry of the state-court judgment.

                                       IV.

           Affirmed.
