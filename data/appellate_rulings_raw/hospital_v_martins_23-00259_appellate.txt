          APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE

           [Hon. Lance E. Walker, U.S. District Judge]


                              Before

                Montecalvo, Kayatta, and Aframe,
                         Circuit Judges.


     Mark A. Darling, with whom Litchfield Cavo, LLP was on brief,
for appellants.
     Brian P. Dunphy, with whom Nicole L. Masiello, Alexis P.
Gannaway, Alex E. Sirio, and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP were
on brief, for appellee.


                         August 19, 2025
            AFRAME,   Circuit   Judge.    These   consolidated   appeals

challenge the dismissals of two diversity actions brought by

hospitals incorporated and operating in Mexico (together, the

"Hospitals") against Martin's Point Health Care, Inc. ("Martin's

Point"), a Maine health insurance company.          The district court

dismissed both actions for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction,

concluding that the Hospitals' negligent-misrepresentation and

promissory-estoppel claims arose under the Medicare Act, such that

the Hospitals were required to exhaust administrative remedies

before suing Martin's Point in federal court.           See 42 U.S.C.

§§ 405(g)-(h), 1395w-22(g)(5), 1395ii.       On appeal, the Hospitals

contend that they were not required to exhaust administrative

remedies because their claims do not arise under the Medicare Act.

Alternatively, they argue that they should have been exempted from

the exhaustion requirement because, as foreign hospitals, they

cannot participate in Medicare's administrative-remedies process.

We affirm.

                                   I.

            The facts and procedural history of the two appeals are

similar.1    Each began with a Martin's Point enrollee seeking


     1    We draw the facts from the Hospitals' complaints and
extrinsic material considered by the district court. See Aversa
v. United States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1209-10 (1st Cir. 1996).     The
extrinsic material considered was certain correspondence from
Martin's Point, as well as benefits-verification forms completed



                                  - 3 -
medical care from one of the plaintiff hospitals while in Mexico.

Upon admission, the enrollees signed contracts obligating them to

pay for all services rendered by the admitting hospital.                    They

also   provided   information       about   their   Martin's    Point   medical

insurance.      The Hospitals then each contacted Martin's Point

through   the    same    third-party    administrator.         Martin's   Point

allegedly represented to the administrator that the enrollees had

"full medical insurance benefits for the . . . out of country

emergency services proposed to be provided."              The administrator

thereafter created verification-of-benefits forms stating that the

enrollees' benefits were "unlimited."

           Believing that the enrollees had "unlimited" benefits,

the Hospitals provided them with extensive medical treatment.

Partway through the enrollees' hospital stays, Martin's Point sent

letters authorizing the stays for several days.                   The letters

stated, however, that Martin's Point's authorization was "subject

to Medicare coding requirements for coverage" and that "payment

[wa]s based on the [enrollee's] eligibility and benefit coverage

at the time of service."             When the Hospitals discharged the

enrollees,      the     enrollees    had     incurred   medical     bills    of

$2,132,982.98 and $512,464.00, respectively.            The Hospitals sought



by a third-party administrator used by the Hospitals. No one
contends on appeal that the court's consideration of these
documents was improper.



                                     - 4 -
reimbursement from Martin's Point, but Martin's Point, asserting

that the two enrollees' Medicare Advantage plans capped benefits

for   out-of-country    medical     services     at   $25,000,    refused   to

reimburse the Hospitals above that limit.

            The Hospitals then commenced separate civil actions in

the District of Maine against Martin's Point based on diversity

jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332, asserting Maine common-law claims

for promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation (together,

the "common-law claims").       The Hospitals' common-law claims rested

on the same     premise:       By   misrepresenting to      the third-party

administrator that its enrollees' medical insurance would fully

cover the proposed course of treatment, Martin's Point had induced

the Hospitals to provide non-reimbursable care to the enrollees.

            Martin's   Point     moved    to   dismiss,   arguing    that   the

Hospitals' common-law claims sought, at bottom,                reimbursement

under the enrollees' Medicare Advantage plans.            And Martin's Point

submitted that, because the Hospitals had not administratively

exhausted    their   benefits    claims    under   the    Medicare   Act,   the

district    court    lacked     subject-matter     jurisdiction      over   the

actions.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).        Martin's Point also argued

that the Hospitals' common-law claims failed to state claims for

relief even if they were not construed as Medicare-benefits claims.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).        The Hospitals opposed the motions,

insisting that because they provided care outside the United States


                                    - 5 -
and sought recovery on common-law theories, they were not required

to exhaust their claims through Medicare's appeals process.                The

Hospitals also argued that their complaints plausibly alleged

common-law claims for relief.

            In   substantially      identical   memorandum    opinions,    the

district court granted Martin's Point's motions to dismiss for

lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.            See Hosp. Amerimed Cancun

S A de C V v. Martin's Point Health Care, Inc., No. 23-cv-00258,

2024 WL 1769171 (D. Me. Apr. 23, 2024) [hereinafter Amerimed I];

Hosp. Quirurgica Del Sur v. Martin's Point Health Care, Inc., No.

23-cv-00259, 2024 WL 1769183 (D. Me. Apr. 23, 2024) [hereinafter

Quirurgica I].      The     court     first     described      the   general

administrative-exhaustion requirements for claims arising under

Medicare.    Amerimed I, 2024 WL 1769171, at *3-4; Quirurgica I,

2024 WL 1769183, at *3-4.      Then, turning to the Hospitals' claims,

the court concluded that, despite being styled as common-law causes

of action, the claims sought to make Martin's Point "pay for

services    provided   to   . . .    Medicare   Part    C   enrollee[s]"   and

therefore arose under Medicare.         Amerimed I, 2024 WL 1769171, at

*5; Quirurgica I, 2024 WL 1769183, at *5.              Because the Hospitals

had not exhausted their administrative remedies under Medicare

Part C before filing suit in federal district court, the court

granted Martin's Point's motions and entered judgment dismissing




                                     - 6 -
each case.     See Amerimed I, 2024 WL 1769171, at *5; Quirurgica I,

2024 WL 1769183, at *5.

            The Hospitals subsequently moved to alter the judgments

of dismissal, arguing that, as foreign hospitals, they could not

participate in the Medicare Part C administrative-review process

and   therefore   were    exempt     from     the    administrative-exhaustion

requirement.      See    Fed.   R.   Civ.     P.    59(e).      In   substantially

identical    memorandum    opinions,     the       district    court    denied   the

motions.     See Hosp. Amerimed Cancun S A de C V v. Martin's Point

Health Care, Inc., No. 23-cv-00258, 2024 WL 3759728 (D. Me. Aug.

12, 2024) [hereinafter Amerimed II]; Hosp. Quirurgica Del Sur v.

Martin's Point Health Care, Inc., No. 23-cv-00259, 2024 WL 3759746

(D. Me. Aug. 12, 2024) [hereinafter Quirurgica II].                    It explained

that by refusing to reimburse the Hospitals for the full value of

the   services    rendered,      Martin's      Point     had     made    so-called

"[o]rganization determinations" under Medicare Part C, which were

subject to mandatory administrative appeal.                  Amerimed II, 2024 WL

3759728, at *2; Quirurgica II, 2024 WL 3759746, at *2. And, noting

that the Hospitals had failed to provide legal authority to support

their argument that, by virtue of their foreign status, they were

precluded from participating in the administrative-review process,

the court concluded that the Hospitals had not shown that the

dismissal of their complaints rested on a manifest error of law,

as required by Rule 59(e).           Amerimed II, 2024 WL 3759728, at *2;


                                      - 7 -
Quirurgica II, 2024 WL 3759746, at *2.       The Hospitals timely

appealed, and we have jurisdiction under title 28, section 1291.

                               II.

          As made applicable to Medicare Part C by title 42,

section 1395w-22(g)(5), title 42, section 405(g) provides for

judicial review of "final decision[s]" of the Secretary of Health

and Human Services regarding the availability of Medicare Part C

benefits and the amounts, if any, due in benefits reimbursement.

Judicial review under section 405(g) is "ma[de] exclusive" by

section 405(h), which strips federal jurisdiction over other civil

actions brought "against the United States, the [Secretary of

Health and Human Services], or any officer or employee thereof

. . . under section 1331 or 1346 of title 28 to recover on any

claim arising under" Medicare Part C.2   Shalala v. Ill. Council on




     2    Although subject-matter jurisdiction in these cases
rests on title 28, section 1332 -- not sections 1331 or 1346, see
42 U.S.C. § 405(h) -- the Hospitals have not argued that they are
exempt from section 405(h)'s bar for this reason.     Because the
Hospitals have waived any argument that section 405(h) does not
apply to civil actions brought under section 1332, we do not
consider the question here.     See Mass. Lobstermen's Ass'n v.
Menashes, 127 F.4th 398, 403 n.2 (1st Cir. 2025). The Hospitals
likewise have never argued that Martin's Point, as a Medicare
Advantage organization, is not a federal officer for the purposes
of 405(h). But see Glob. Rescue Jets, LLC v. Kaiser Found. Health
Plan, Inc., 30 F.4th 905, 915-17 (9th Cir. 2022) (holding that
Medicare Advantage organizations are "officers or employees" of
the federal government). That argument too is therefore waived.
See Mass. Lobstermen's Ass'n, 127 F.4th at 403 n.2.



                              - 8 -
Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 10 (2000) (emphasis omitted)

(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 405(h)); see 42 U.S.C. § 1395ii.

           It is undisputed that the Secretary has not issued "final

decision[s]" regarding the amounts reimbursable by Martin's Point

to the Hospitals for the services they rendered to its enrollees.

42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g), 1395w-22(g)(5).           The Hospitals' argument is,

in essence, that they may pursue their common-law claims in federal

district court notwithstanding section 405(h)'s jurisdictional bar

because their claims do not "aris[e] under" Medicare.              42 U.S.C.

§§ 405(h), 1395ii.    The Hospitals also argue that, if their claims

do arise under Medicare, their failure to pursue those claims

through administrative channels should be excused because, as

foreign hospitals, they are unable to participate in Medicare Part

C's administrative-review process.          See Ill. Council, 529 U.S. at

19 (holding that section 1395ii does not apply section 405(h) to

Medicare Part B where doing so "would not simply channel review

through the agency, but would mean no review at all").

           We address the Hospitals' arguments in turn.            To set the

stage for our analysis, we first provide some general background

about   Medicare   Part   C   and   describe    when   a   claim   "aris[es]"

thereunder.   42 U.S.C. §§ 405(h), 1395ii.

                                     A.

           Medicare is a federal health-insurance program that

primarily serves those sixty-five years of age and older.                 See


                                    - 9 -
First Med. Health Plan v. Vega-Ramos, 479 F.3d 46, 48 (1st Cir.

2007).        When enacted in 1965, Medicare covered inpatient care

(through Medicare Part A, presently codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395c

to 1395i-6) and outpatient care (through Medicare Part B, presently

codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395j to 1395w-6).             See First Med. Health

Plan, 479 F.3d at 48.         Under Parts A and B -- sometimes referred

to together as "original Medicare," see, e.g., 42 C.F.R. § 422.2

(2025) -- the federal government reimburses healthcare providers

on a fee-for-service basis at rates set by the Centers for Medicare

and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of

Health and Human Services.         See Glob. Rescue Jets, 30 F.4th at

909.       Original Medicare usually does not provide reimbursement for

services rendered outside of the United States.                See 42 C.F.R.

§§ 424.121-424.122 (2025).

               In 1997, Congress enacted Medicare Part C.         See Pub. L.

No. 105–33, § 4001, 111 Stat. 251, 275-327 (1997) (codified as

amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395w-21 to 1395w-29).3               Medicare Part C

permits       Medicare   beneficiaries    to   enroll    in   private   health

insurance plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans.             See 42 U.S.C.

§ 1395w-21.         Private   entities,   known    as    Medicare   Advantage

organizations, administer these plans.            See id. § 1395w-21(a)(2).


       3  Certain provisions of Medicare Part C, including section
1395w-21, refer to "Medicare+Choice," which was the name by which
the Medicare Advantage program was previously known. See Vega-
Ramos, 479 F.3d at 48 n.1.


                                   - 10 -
Medicare Advantage organizations receive a fixed monthly sum from

the federal government for each                 enrollee.    See id.     § 1395w-

23(a)(1)(A); 42 C.F.R. § 422.304(a) (2025).               In exchange for these

payments, Medicare Advantage organizations must provide enrollees

with the benefits available under original Medicare, subject to

several exceptions not relevant here.                   See 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-

22(a)(1); 42 C.F.R. §§ 422.100(a), (c)(1), 422.101 (2025).                  These

are known as "basic benefits."               42 U.S.C. § 1395w-22(a); 42 C.F.R.

§ 422.2 (2025).

                  In addition to basic benefits, Medicare Advantage plans

may offer, subject to approval by the Department of Health and

Human Services, "supplemental benefits" for services not covered

by original Medicare.           See 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-22(a)(3); 42 C.F.R.

§§ 422.100(c)(2), 422.102 (2025); see also Glob. Rescue Jets, 30

F.4th at 909.             Enrollees pay for these supplemental benefits

through additional premiums or increased cost-sharing.                    See 42

C.F.R. § 422.100(c)(2)(i) (2025).                Supplemental benefits, which

vary       from    plan   to   plan,   may    include   out-of-country   medical

services.4



       4  For instance, Martin's Point advertises its Medicare
Advantage plans as offering out-of-country emergency and urgent
care supplemental benefits:

                  All our [Medicare Advantage] plans -- whether
                  they   are   an   HMO,   HMO-POS,   or   LPPO
                  plan -- cover you for urgent and emergency

           To provide basic and supplemental benefits, Medicare

Advantage organizations may contract with healthcare providers.5

See   42   C.F.R.   §§ 422.200-422.224        (2025).      These       contracts

establish the terms of reimbursement for services provided to the

Medicare    Advantage     organization's      enrollees        under    specific

Medicare Advantage plans.          See RenCare, Ltd. v. Humana Health Plan

      5    Medicare     Part   C    regulations   define   a    "provider"   as
follows:

           (1) Any individual who is engaged in the
           delivery of health care services in a State
           and is licensed or certified by the State to
           engage in that activity in the State; and

           (2) Any entity that is engaged in the delivery
           of health care services in a State and is
           licensed or certified to deliver those
           services if such licensing or certification is
           required by State law or regulation.

of Tex., Inc., 395 F.3d 555, 558-59 (5th Cir. 2004); Glob. Rescue

Jets, 30 F.4th at 909-10.   Not all providers enter such contracts,

however.   See Tenet Healthsystem GB, Inc. v. Care Improvement Plus

S. Cent. Ins. Co., 875 F.3d 584, 587-88 (11th Cir. 2017); Caris

MPI, Inc. v. UnitedHealthcare, Inc., 108 F.4th 340, 344 (5th Cir.

2024).   If an enrollee receives covered services from a healthcare

provider that does not have a contract with the Medicare Advantage

organization -- referred    to   by   federal   regulations    as   a   non-

contract provider, see, e.g., 42 C.F.R. § 422.214 (2025) -- the

provider generally must accept reimbursement for the services at

original-Medicare rates.    See id.; 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-22(k)(1); see

also Glob. Rescue Jets, 30 F.4th at 910.

           Federal law and regulations charge Medicare Advantage

organizations with the initial responsibility for deciding whether

services are covered under their Medicare Advantage plans and, if

so, the reimbursement rates for those services.          See 42 U.S.C.

§ 1395w-22(g)(1); 42 C.F.R. § 422.566 (2025).        Coverage decisions

made by Medicare Advantage organizations are called "organization

determinations."   See 42 C.F.R. § 422.566 (2025).            Organization

determinations include the refusal "to provide or pay for services,

in whole or in part . . . , that the enrollee believes should be

furnished or arranged for" by the Medicare Advantage organization.

Id. § 422.566(b)(3).    An enrollee may request an organization

determination from their Medicare Advantage organization, as may


                                 - 13 -
the   representative   of    the   enrollee    and    "[a]ny    provider     that

furnishes, or intends to furnish, services to the enrollee."                  See

id. § 422.566(c)(1).

           Unsurprisingly,      sometimes     there       are   disputes     over

Medicare Part C contains a multi-step process through which a

dissatisfied party may administratively appeal an organization

determination.6 See 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-22(g); 42 C.F.R. §§ 422.560-

422.634 (2025).    The "final decision" of the agency is reviewable

in federal district court, subject to the satisfaction of an

           enrollee (that is, a physician or other
           provider who has furnished a service to the
           enrollee and formally agrees to waive any right
           to payment from the enrollee for that service);
           (c) The legal representative of a deceased
           enrollee's estate; or (d) any other provider or
           entity (other than the [Medicare Advantage]
           organization) determined to have an appealable
           interest in the proceeding.

do not contend that section 405(h), as incorporated into Medicare
Part C, applies in a manner materially different from section
405(h) as incorporated into original Medicare, we consider
decisions concerning section 405(h)'s application to claims
arising under original Medicare as instructive as to the scope of
the provision for the purposes of this appeal. See Glob. Rescue
Jets, 30 F.4th at 914 (concluding that "the constraints on judicial
review imposed by § 405(h) apply equally to claims for benefits
under Part C" and to claims for benefits under original Medicare).

consensus that a claim usually does not arise under Medicare where

a court does not need to interpret the Medicare Act to grant

relief, and the relief ultimately sought is not Medicare benefits

or their practical equivalent.        See, e.g., Nichole Med. Equip.,

                                     C.

          With this framework in mind, we return to the Hospitals'

arguments.   The Hospitals' principal argument is that they were

not required to exhaust administrative remedies for their common-

law claims because neither the treatment that they provided to the

Martin's Point enrollees nor the civil actions that they later


                                - 17 -
filed had anything to do with Medicare.                        The Hospitals contend

that, "as Medicare enrollees," the Martin's Point enrollees were

"not    entitled       to     any    out-of-country         health     benefits      from

Medicare."       The Hospitals' point seems to be that any "out-of-

country" benefits owed to the enrollees under their Medicare

Advantage      plans    could       not   be    Medicare       benefits,     and   claims

concerning      the    existence       or   non-existence         of   those      benefits

consequently         cannot    "aris[e]        under"      Medicare.         42    U.S.C.

§§ 405(h), 1395ii.

            The Hospitals' argument                  misapprehends     the nature of

supplemental benefits under Medicare Part C.                       Although coverage

under original Medicare may not extend to the sorts of services

that the Hospitals            rendered to the enrollees,               see     42 C.F.R.

§§ 411.9, 424.120-424.127 (2025), Medicare Advantage plans, such

as those that Martin's Point issued to the enrollees here, can

provide supplemental benefits for medical care rendered abroad,

see    supra    II.A.         Supplemental          benefits    constitute        Medicare

benefits       for     the    purposes         of    the   administrative-remedies

provisions of Medicare Part C and related regulations.                         See Glob.

Rescue Jets, 30 F.4th at 918; 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-22; 42 C.F.R.

§ 422.566(a) (2025).                And the Hospitals do not contend that

disputes concerning Medicare benefits are outside of Medicare

"Part C's administrative review scheme," Glob. Rescue Jets, 30

F.4th at 918; see 42 C.F.R. § 422.566(a)-(b) (2025); we therefore


                                          - 18 -
assume that they are subject to the scheme.                Thus, although the

fact that the services at issue were rendered abroad by foreign

hospitals may bear on the extent of Martin's Point's reimbursement

obligations under its plans, it does not remove the reimbursement

dispute entirely from the scope of Medicare Part C.

            With that misapprehension dispelled, it is apparent that

the Hospitals' common-law claims "aris[e] under" Medicare Part C.

42 U.S.C. §§ 405(h), 1395ii.                To recover on these claims, the

Hospitals must prove, inter alia, that, contrary to Martin's

Point's alleged representations, the Medicare Advantage plans at

issue did not, in fact, provide unlimited benefits for the disputed

medical services.          See Rand v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 832 A.2d

771, 774 (Me. 2003) (noting that information provided must be false

to maintain a negligent-misrepresentation claim); Harvey v. Dow,

962 A.2d 322, 325 (Me. 2008) (requiring promise to be "otherwise

unenforceable" to maintain a promissory-estoppel claim (quoting

Daigle Com. Grp., Inc. v. St. Laurent, 734 A.2d 667, 672 (Me.

1999))).    We see no way for the Hospitals to make that showing

that would not require the district court to redecide Martin's

Point's organization determination about the extent of benefits

due under its plans.           See Glob. Rescue Jets, 30 F.4th at 919

(concluding that tort claims arose under Medicare Part C when their

success    "rest[ed]       directly    on   the   interpretation   of   benefits

provided    under"     a    Medicare    plan).       The   Hospitals'   claims,


                                       - 19 -
consequently, are not "independent," Kaiser v. Blue Cross of Cal.,

347 F.3d 1107, 1115 (9th Cir. 2003), or "separate," Nichole Med.

Equip., 694 F.3d at 348, from the underlying Medicare supplemental-

benefits determinations, but rather are "inextricably intertwined"

with them, Heckler, 466 U.S. at 614.                As a result, the claims

"aris[e] under" Medicare Part C.9            42 U.S.C. §§ 405(h), 1395ii.

            The     Hospitals'    promissory-estoppel         claims   may   arise

under    Medicare    Part   C    for   a   second   reason.     The    Hospitals'

argument, as we have described it so far, is premised upon the

unavailability of Medicare benefits for services rendered abroad.

At times, however, the Hospitals appear to advance the separate

and seemingly contradictory argument that benefits covering these

services may be available under the Martin's Point plans, but as

a practical matter cannot be recovered by the Hospitals because

Martin's Point will not pay the benefits voluntarily and the

Hospitals are unable to participate in the administrative-review




     9    We need not address whether tort claims would arise under
Medicare where the allegedly tortious conduct was undertaken by
the defendant independent of its role as a Medicare Advantage
organization administering a benefits plan. Cf. Do Song Uhm, 620
F.3d at 1145 (holding that enrollees' false-advertising and
consumer-protection    claims   against   a    Medicare   Advantage
organization were "wholly collateral to a claim for benefits" where
plaintiffs could prove the elements of their claims "without regard
to any provisions of [Medicare Part D] relating to provision of
benefits." (quotation marks and citation omitted)).

process necessary to force Martin's Point to pay, see infra II.D.10

If the Hospitals intend to assert that they are entitled to

additional reimbursement under the enrollees' Medicare Advantage

plans, as it appears that they do, then their attempt to enforce

their entitlement to those benefits through a promissory-estoppel

claim would be virtually indistinguishable from a direct claim for

Medicare Part C benefits.   See Heckler, 466 U.S. at 614 (holding

that claims arose under the Medicare Act where, "at bottom," they

sought benefits).   And claims for benefits arise under Medicare,

no matter how "[c]leverly concealed" they may be.     Do Song Uhm,

620 F.3d at 1141 (alteration in original) (quoting Kaiser, 347

F.3d at 1112).

           The Hospitals' remaining arguments are without merit.

The Hospitals contend that their common-law claims do not arise

under Medicare because they sound in tort and seek to recover

damages.   But "[a] claim may arise under the Medicare Act even

though, as pleaded, it also arises under some other law," Midland

Psychiatric Assocs., 145 F.3d at 1004, and "the type of remedy

sought is not strongly probative of whether a claim" arises under

Medicare, Kaiser, 347 F.3d at 1112.



     10   The Hospitals declined to concede at oral argument that
they are not entitled to benefits under the Martin's Point Medicare
Advantage plans. And nowhere have they explained what, if not the
plans, would entitle them to the approximately $25,000 per insured
that Martin's Point has paid them so far.



                              - 21 -
            The Hospitals also rely on the Fifth Circuit's decisions

in Caris MPI, Inc. v. UnitedHealthcare, Inc., 108 F.4th 340 (5th

Cir. 2024) and RenCare, Ltd. v. Humana Health Plan of Texas, Inc.,

395 F.3d 555 (5th Cir. 2004).            Noting that they are asserting

claims in their own right (and not as assignees of the enrollees),

the Hospitals contend that, as in Caris and RenCare, the enrollees

have no interest in these actions.              See Caris, 108 F.4th at 350;

RenCare, 395 F.3d at 560.        Caris and RenCare, however, turned on

facts that are not present here. RenCare concerned a reimbursement

dispute between a Medicare Advantage organization and a provider,

but, unlike here, the reimbursement terms were set by a contract

between the parties, and the dispute could be resolved under that

contract without reference to underlying Medicare law.                 See 395

F.3d at 558-59. Moreover, the contract waived the provider's right

to recover from the enrollees, meaning that regardless of how the

contract dispute resolved, no enrollee would face liability.                  See

id.

            Caris, for its part, concerned a dispute between a

provider and a Medicare Advantage organization over the latter's

efforts to recoup alleged overpayments discovered during a post-

payment   audit.    See   108    F.4th     at    345.    The    provider   sued,

principally challenging the recoupments as having violated an

unwritten    contract    between   the     parties,      implied   from    their

longstanding    course    of    dealing.         See    Caris   MPI,   Inc.    v.

(N.D. Tex. July 26, 2023), aff'd in part, rev'd in part and

remanded, 108 F.4th 340.           The Fifth Circuit concluded that no

enrollee had an interest in the "only question" presented by the

case, i.e., "whether [the Medicare Advantage organization] can

recoup payments it made to [the provider] for services already

performed."       Caris, 108 F.4th at 350.                  The recoupment did not

amount to an organization determination; no enrollee had been

denied    benefits;    and   no    enrollee          stood    to   face   liability,

regardless of the outcome of the parties' dispute.                        See id. at

350-51.      Relying    on     RenCare,        the    Fifth    Circuit    held      that

administrative exhaustion was not required.                   See id.

            Here, by contrast, there is no allegation of a contract

between   Martin's     Point      and    the     Hospitals;        Martin's    Point's

conclusion    that     certain     benefits          were    not   covered    was    an

organization determination; and the Hospitals' complaints state

that the enrollees are personally responsible to the Hospitals for

the unreimbursed costs of their care.                 Caris and RenCare thus fail

to support the Hospitals' argument that their claims do not arise

under Medicare Part C.

                                          D.

            Our    conclusion     that    the        Hospitals'     claims    "aris[e]

under" Medicare does not fully resolve these appeals.                        42 U.S.C.

§§ 405(h), 1395ii.       Claims that "aris[e] under" Medicare Part C


                                        - 23 -
may be brought in federal court notwithstanding section 405(h)'s

jurisdiction-stripping provision if an administrative-exhaustion

requirement "would not lead to a channeling of review through the

agency" but instead "would mean no review at all."11              Ill. Council,

529 U.S. at 17.          Although the Hospitals do not cite Illinois

Council, they contend in substance that its exception should apply

here because, as foreign hospitals, they are, in their words,

"simply   . . .    not    eligible"    and    "do    not   have   standing"   to

participate in the administrative-appeals process.

           The    Hospitals    did    not    raise   their   Illinois     Council

argument or anything resembling it below until their Rule 59(e)

motions   seeking    relief    from    the     judgments     dismissing    their

respective cases.        "[A]rguments that could have been but were not

presented to the district court prior to judgment are not preserved

for appeal." Disaster Sols., LLC v. City of Santa Isabel, 21 F.4th

reconsideration, as the Hospitals have done here, "neither cures

the original omission nor preserves the argument as a matter of




     11   None of the parties contend that the Illinois Council
exception applies to Medicare Part C differently than it does to
Medicare Parts A and B. See Ill. Council, 529 U.S. at 17. For
the purposes of this appeal, we assume no difference in the
application of the exception to Medicare Part C.

right for appellate review."12    Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d

94, 104 (1st Cir. 2006).     Rule 59(e) motions are intended to

provide relief where the "judgment evidence[s] a manifest error of

law," Biltcliffe v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 772 F.3d 925, 930 (1st

Cir. 2014) (quoting Glob. Naps, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc.,

489 F.3d 13, 25 (1st Cir. 2007)), and it is rarely error -- let

alone manifest error -- for the district court to have entered

judgment without passing on an argument that was not raised, see

United States v. Rivera-Rodríguez, 75 F.4th 1, 26 (1st Cir. 2023).

          In any event, the Hospitals have failed to demonstrate

that the Illinois Council exception applies here.     The Hospitals'

argument is that they are ineligible to participate in Medicare

Part C, including its administrative-review process, because they

are not "providers" as defined by the pertinent regulations.    They

contend that because a "provider" is an "entity . . . engaged in

the delivery of health care services in a State," they are not

included, since they operate in Mexico.     42 C.F.R. § 422.2 (2025)



     12   The Hospitals contend that they were free to raise their
Illinois Council argument at any time because the argument goes to
subject-matter jurisdiction. Although the lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction may be raised at any time, a party may not freely
debut new arguments in support of subject-matter jurisdiction
after their case has been dismissed. See Seafreeze Shoreside v.
U.S. Dep't of Interior, 123 F.4th 1, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2024); Bronner
v. Duggan, 962 F.3d 596, 611 (D.C. Cir. 2020) ("[A]rguments in
favor of subject matter jurisdiction can be waived by inattention
or deliberate choice." (quoting NetworkIP, LLC v. FCC, 548 F.3d
116, 120 (D.C. Cir. 2008))).



                                 - 25 -
(emphasis   added).      The   Hospitals   then   submit   that,   as   non-

providers, they are barred from participating in the Medicare Part

C administrative-review process.

            But the Hospitals give essentially no explanation for

that final -- and critical -- portion of their argument, i.e.,

that, as non-providers, they are barred from the administrative-

review process.       Their appellate briefs, like their Rule 59(e)

motions, principally rely on an affidavit from the chief executive

of their third-party administrator.        The affidavit states that, in

the executive's experience, CMS rejects administrative appeals

from foreign hospitals "out of hand" because such hospitals, not

qualifying as providers, "have no status with CMS."13 The affidavit

does not elaborate on this point, and the Hospitals do not explain



     13   Whether CMS does in fact reject such appeals is not clear
from the record.    Two emails attached to the chief executive's
affidavit as proof of this practice are at best inconclusive.
Nevertheless, the Hospitals assert we must accept as a well-pleaded
fact that CMS "does not review or handle disputes between a foreign
provider and a Medicare Advantage Organization." But insofar as
the chief executive intended to say that CMS has no legal authority
to handle such disputes, the ostensible fact is simply a legal
conclusion. See Thompson v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 982 F.3d
809, 811 (1st Cir. 2020) (noting that, in assessing whether a
plaintiff's complaint has stated a claim, courts do not accept
"legal conclusions clothed as factual allegations"). And insofar
as the Hospitals intend instead to argue that CMS's "pattern of
conduct" in rejecting disputes involving foreign hospitals permits
us to conclude that there is a de facto exclusion of the Hospitals
from the administrative review process, we cannot do so based on
two facially inconclusive emails unaccompanied by "the legal
analysis necessary to develop such an argument."       Puerto Rican
Ass'n, 521 F.3d at 50.

why their not being providers leads them to have "no status" with

CMS, what having "no status" with CMS means as a legal matter, or

why having "no status" with CMS results in their preclusion from

participating in the administrative-review process.           Failing to

explain   how   or   why   they    are     supposedly   foreclosed   from

participating in the administrative-review process, the Hospitals

cannot establish that the Illinois Council exception applies here.

See W.R. Cobb Co. v. V.J. Designs, LLC, 130 F.4th 224, 239 (1st

Cir. 2025) ("[D]eveloping a sustained argument out of [the record]

and legal precedents is the job of the appellant, not the reviewing

court . . . ." (alterations in original) (quoting Town of Norwood

v. FERC, 202 F.3d 392, 405 (1st Cir. 2000))).              We therefore

conclude that the district court's denial of the Hospitals' Rule

59(e) motions was not an abuse of discretion.

                                   III.

          For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's

dismissals of the Hospitals' complaints for lack of subject-matter

jurisdiction and the denials of the Hospitals' Rule 59(e) motions.
