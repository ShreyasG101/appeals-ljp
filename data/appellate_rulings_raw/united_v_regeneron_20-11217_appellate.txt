                        February 18, 2025
          KAYATTA, Circuit Judge.           This appeal calls for us to

determine the meaning of the words "resulting from" as used in a

2010 amendment to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), 42

U.S.C. § 1320a-7b.      See Patient Protection and Affordable Care

Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119, 759 (2010) (codified at

42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(g)). That 2010 amendment states that "a claim

[for payment by a federal healthcare program] that includes items

or services resulting from a violation of [the AKS] constitutes a

false or fraudulent claim for purposes of" the False Claims Act

(FCA), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-33.        Id. (emphasis added).     The FCA, in

turn, imposes civil liability on anyone who "knowingly presents,

or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment

or approval" or "knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or

used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent

claim."      31   U.S.C.   § 3729(a)(1)(A), (a)(1)(B).         Whether     a

violation of the AKS is also a false claim under the FCA makes a

difference   because    the   FCA   allows    both   the   government    and

whistleblowers to bring civil actions for damages.

          The government alleges that, in violation of the AKS,

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals knowingly induced prescriptions of a

drug called Eylea by covering copayments for certain patients who

received the drug.     Further, contends the government, when doctors

filed Medicare claims for Eylea prescribed to patients receiving

copayment assistance, those claims "resulted from" a violation of


                                    - 3 -
the AKS whether or not those claims would have been made even had

Regeneron not covered the co-pay.         Accordingly, as the government

sees it, those Medicare claims were "false or fraudulent" for

purposes of the FCA.

           Regeneron begs to differ.        The company says that a claim

only "result[s] from" an AKS violation if it includes "items or

services" that would not have been paid for by the government

absent the AKS violation.          Put differently, Regeneron contends

that an AKS violation must be a but-for cause of the challenged

claim.   So, reasons Regeneron, if a doctor would have purchased

(and sought reimbursement for) Eylea anyway, then the subsequent

Medicare claim cannot have "result[ed] from" Regeneron's allegedly

illicit payments.     As we will explain, we agree with Regeneron.

                                     I.

                                     A.

           Regeneron manufactures Eylea.           Eylea is one of just a

few drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for

treating an ophthalmological condition called neovascular age-

related macular degeneration, also known as wet AMD.            Eylea is a

"buy and bill" drug under Medicare Part B.               This means that

physicians buy the drug, prescribe it, administer it in their

offices, and then submit a reimbursement claim to Medicare.              It

also   means   that   Eylea   is    subject   to    Part B's   cost-sharing




                                    - 4 -
requirement:   Medicare covers eighty percent of the cost while the

patient pays the remaining twenty percent.

          Eylea is expensive.     Since 2013, Medicare Part B has

spent over $11.5 billion on Eylea.         A single injection costs

$1,850.   Because a patient requires multiple injections per year,

annual per-patient co-pays routinely exceed $2,000.         For some

patients, that co-pay can deter the patients from using Eylea.

And while only a few drugs are FDA-approved to treat wet AMD, at

least one other drug that is much cheaper than Eylea is available

for off-label use.

          These economics create an incentive for Regeneron to

price Eylea in a way that frees the patient from the co-pay.       An

injection that sells for $1,850 with a $330 co-pay will likely

sell less well than an injection that costs $2,000 with no co-pay.

Of course, the insurer -- not the manufacturer -- sets the co-pay

(to ensure that the patient has economic skin in the game when

deciding whether to use the drug).      But if the patient knows that

the manufacturer will rebate that co-pay, that is more or less

equivalent to having no co-pay.

          Here enters the AKS, which prohibits kickbacks.1        All

parties assume for purposes of this appeal that a rebate by the


     1  The AKS imposes criminal liability on anyone who "knowingly
and willfully offers or pays any renumeration . . . to any person
to induce such person[] . . . to purchase, lease, order . . . or



                                - 5 -
manufacturer to the patient or doctor would be a kickback.             So

some creative manufacturers have tried a less direct work-around

by supporting charitable foundations that help patients with co-

pays.    The manufacturer gives the foundation a donation, and the

foundation gives patients (or doctors) the co-pay.

           Suffice it to say, such an arrangement can easily be

seen as a conduit for manufacturer rebates.           The Department of

Health and Human Services therefore issued guidance attempting to

differentiate truly independent co-pay assistance charities from

rebate    conduits.     See    Special   Advisory    Bulletin:   Patient

Assistance   Programs   for   Medicare   Part D     Enrollees,   70   Fed.

Reg. 70623, 70627 (Nov. 22, 2005).

           In this case brought under the FCA, the government

alleges that Regeneron crossed well into the conduit side of that

difference when it paid more than $60 million over the course of

four to five years to the Chronic Disease Fund (CDF), a foundation

that provides copayment assistance to patients suffering from wet

AMD.    For purposes of this appeal, we follow the parties' lead by

assuming, without deciding, that some or all of those donations

were unlawful kickbacks.      We focus our attention, instead, on the




recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility,
service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part
under a Federal health care program." 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)(2).


                                 - 6 -
proper standard of causation required to turn an AKS kickback into

a per se FCA violation.

                                      B.

           A 2010 amendment to the AKS provides that a "claim that

includes items or services resulting from a violation of [the AKS]

constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of [the FCA]."

42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(g).       In other words, an "AKS violation that

results in a federal [healthcare] payment is a per se false claim

under the FCA."     Guilfoile v. Shields, 913 F.3d 178, 190 (1st Cir.

2019) (quoting United States ex rel. Lutz v. United States, 853

F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 2017)).

           Training their attention on the issue of causation, the

parties   filed    competing   motions     under   Federal    Rule    of    Civil

Procedure 56.      Regeneron argued that, under the 2010 amendment,

the   government    "b[ore]    the   burden   of    proving    that    an    AKS

violation . . . actually caused [a] physician to provide different

medical treatment (and thus caused the false claims)."                     United

States v. Regeneron Pharms., Inc., No. 20-11217, 2023 WL 6296393,

at *10 (D. Mass. Sept. 27, 2023).             In other words, Regeneron

asserted that the phrase "resulting from" in the 2010 amendment

imposed a "'but-for' causation standard."             Id.     The government

disagreed, and it urged the district court to adopt the Third

Circuit's view that "all that is required to prove a causal link

[under the 2010 amendment] is that 'a particular patient is exposed


                                     - 7 -
to an illegal recommendation or referral and a provider submits a

claim for reimbursement pertaining to that patient.'" Id. (quoting

United States ex rel. Greenfield v. Medco Health Sols., Inc., 880

F.3d 89, 100 (3d Cir. 2018)).

          Citing cases from the Sixth and Eighth Circuits, the

district court agreed with Regeneron's interpretation.    See United

States ex rel. Martin v. Hathaway, 63 F.4th 1043, 1052–55 (6th

Cir. 2023) (interpreting the phrase "resulting from" in the 2010

amendment as imposing a but-for causation requirement); United

States ex rel. Cairns v. D.S. Med. LLC, 42 F.4th 828, 834–35 (8th

Cir. 2022) (same).   Nevertheless, noting the conflict in the case

law and explaining that the issue was pivotal to the outcome in

this and another case in the circuit, see United States v. Teva

Pharms. USA, Inc., 682 F. Supp. 3d 142, 148 (D. Mass. Jul. 14,

2023), the district court concluded that an immediate appeal would

materially advance the ending of the case.         Accordingly, the

district court sought and we granted interlocutory review pursuant

to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).   We now affirm the district court's ruling

that to treat an AKS violation as a false or fraudulent claim under

the FCA, the government must prove that the AKS violation was a

but-for cause of the false claim.     Our reasoning follows.

                                II.

          As a threshold matter, the government contends that

another panel of this court already did our work for us by stating,


                                - 8 -
with   reference     to   the   2010   amendment,   that    "if   there   is    a

sufficient causal connection between an AKS violation and a claim

submitted to the federal government, that claim is false within

the meaning of the FCA."            Guilfoile, 913 F.3d at 190.            That

statement     says   nothing      about    what   "causal    connection"       is

sufficient.     But, as the government stresses, the statement is

directly followed by a citation to the Third Circuit's opinion in

Greenfield, 880 F.3d at 96-98, and to a district court opinion,

United States ex rel. Bawduniak v. Biogen Idec, Inc., No. 12-cv-

10601, 2018 WL 1996829, at *5-6 (D. Mass. April 27, 2018).                     In

each case, the court indicated that it was sufficient that a

patient chose to use the defendant's services or product after

being "exposed" to an inducement, even if the patient would have

made the same decision in the absence of the inducement.                    See

Greenfield, 880 F.3d at 100; Biogen, 2018 WL 1996829, at *5-6.

So, reasons the government, we should read Guilfoile as having

adopted both what it said (that there must be a sufficient causal

connection) and what those cited cases said was sufficient.

            We disagree.        "The mere fact that a court cites a case

approvingly for one point does not imply the court's wholesale

acceptance of each and every proposition for which the cited case

stands."    Kholi v. Wall, 582 F.3d 147, 152 n.5 (1st Cir. 2009).

This rule applies with special force here.             The Guilfoile court

stressed that "the issue before us is not the standard for proving


                                       - 9 -
an FCA violation based on the AKS, but rather the requirements for

pleading an FCA retaliation claim."          913 F.3d at 190.       The

plaintiff in Guilfoile therefore did not need to prove an FCA

violation, by virtue of the AKS or otherwise.         He only needed to

prove that the conduct he reported "could reasonably lead to an

FCA action."    Guilfoile, 913 F.3d at 189.     Hence, the court said

that it was not "assess[ing] the full implications" of the 2010

amendment.   Id. at 190.

          Finding that Guilfoile therefore does not guide -- much

less control -- our analysis of the phrase "resulting from" in the

2010 amendment, we turn now to analyzing the phrase as a matter of

first impression in this circuit.

                                III.

          The   proper   interpretation    of   the   2010   amendment's

"resulting from" language is a question of law, so we review the

district court's interpretation de novo.        See Kenyon v. Cedeno-

Rivera, 47 F.4th 12, 20 (1st Cir. 2022).

                                 A.

          The Supreme Court has held that a phrase like "resulting

from" "imposes . . . a requirement of actual causality."         Burrage

v. United States, 571 U.S. 204, 211 (2014); see also Paroline v.

United States, 572 U.S. 434, 445 (2014) ("The words 'as a result

of' plainly suggest causation.").       "In the usual course," such a

requirement of actual causality as imposed by the words "resulting


                               - 10 -
from" demands proof "'that the harm would not have occurred' . . .

but for . . . the defendant's conduct."                Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med.

Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 346–47 (2013) (quoting Restatement

(First) of Torts § 431, cmt. a (Am. L. Inst. 1934)).               Accordingly,

"it is one of the traditional background principles 'against which

Congress legislate[s]' that a phrase such as 'result[ing] from'

imposes a requirement of but-for causation."              Burrage, 571 U.S. at

214 (first alteration in original) (quoting Nassar, 570 U.S. at

347).

            But the fact that "resulting from" is read as calling

for but-for causation in "the usual course," Nassar, 570 U.S. at

346, does not mean that such a reading applies in every situation.

Rather, that reading serves as                a   default assumption, not an

immutable rule.      See Paroline, 572 U.S. at 458.          A court may read

a phrase like "resulting from" to impose an alternative causation

standard    if    there   are    "textual      or   contextual   indication[s]"

supporting that approach.                Burrage, 571 U.S. at 212; see also

Paroline, 572 U.S. at 458 ("[T]he availability of alternative

causal standards where circumstances warrant is, no less than the

but-for test itself as the default, part of the background legal

tradition against which Congress has legislated.").

            The    concept      of   a    "textual"   indication   seems   clear

enough:    We look at the statutory language at issue to see what it

indicates.       See Paroline, 572 U.S. at 458.             The concept of a


                                         - 11 -
"contextual indication" is perhaps less clear, but at a minimum

includes (as evidenced by Paroline) a signal of legislative purpose

gleaned from related statutory text.         In other words, if the text

at issue, when read in the context of the statutory scheme as a

whole,   indicates     that   a   but-for    standard   would     "undermine

congressional intent," it may be inappropriate to read a phrase

like "resulting from" as imposing such a standard.          Id.

           The Court's analysis in Paroline elucidates this point.

That case involved a statute -- 18 U.S.C. § 2259 -- that required

restitution for victims of child pornography.            Id. at 439.       The

statute defined a victim as a person "harmed as a result of"

possession of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. § 2259(c)(4) (emphasis

added), and required that a court determine "the full amount of

the victim's losses . . . incurred by the victim as a result of

the trafficking in child pornography depicting the victim," id.

§ 2259(b)(2)(A)      (emphasis    added).     Ordinarily,   this    kind   of

language would impose a but-for causation standard.             See Burrage,

571 U.S. at 214; Paroline, 572 U.S. at 458.              But six Justices

nevertheless found such a standard inappropriate.

           A five-Justice majority concluded that the statute as a

whole left "no doubt [that] Congress wanted victims [of child

pornography] to receive restitution," because § 2259 expressly

made   restitution    "mandatory"    for    child   pornography    offenses.

Paroline, 572 U.S. at 457 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 2259(b)(4)).                 A


                                   - 12 -
but-for causation standard would render this "mandatory" language

"a dead letter," because it would be impossible to determine the

"discrete" injury caused by each individual possessor of child

pornography.       Id. at 456–57.     So, given the context provided by

the statute as a whole, the majority found that a but-for standard

would   not    serve   § 2259's    "twin    goals     of   helping    the   victim

achieve . . . restitution . . . and impressing upon offenders the

fact that child-pornography crimes . . . affect real victims."

Id. at 459.        Justice Sotomayor -- writing in dissent -- agreed

with the majority on this point.          She noted that there was a strong

"contextual"       argument     against    applying    a    but-for    causation

standard to § 2259: Such a standard would "swallow [the statute's]

'mandatory' restitution command, leaving victims with little hope

of recovery."      Id. at 477 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).

              In   sum,   the    phrase     "resulting      from"     imposes    a

requirement of actual causality, which in ordinary course takes

the form of but-for causation, but we may deviate from this

ordinary course if the statute in question provides "textual or

contextual indications" for doing so. A "textual" indication draws

on the plain text of the statute's causation language, while a

"contextual" indication arises from the substance or structure of

the statutory scheme as a whole.            With these principles in mind,

we turn to addressing the parties' respective interpretations of

the 2010 amendment.


                                     - 13 -
                                  B.

            The government cannot show that the text of the 2010

amendment itself contraindicates a but-for causation standard.

Simply put, there is no language in the 2010 amendment that by

itself runs counter to the presumption that "resulting from" calls

for proof of but-for causation.        So, the government finds itself

relying on three contextual arguments.

                                  1.

            First, throughout its brief, the government stresses

that the AKS    itself   -- including its imposition of criminal

liability -- requires no proof that the government would not have

paid a claim but for the inducement of the offered kickback.

Rather, contends the government, the "animating principle" of the

AKS is "that financial conflicts in themselves corrupt medical

decisionmaking."    So, contends the government, because the 2010

amendment was "built on" such a statutory scheme, it too should

require only that payments are meant to induce the provision of

items or services and that those items or services are subsequently

provided.    At least one other court in this circuit has accepted

this contention.    See United States ex rel. Witkin v. Medtronic,

Inc., No. 11-cv-10790, 2024 WL 1892405, at *18 (D. Mass. Mar. 31,

2024) ("It would be counterintuitive for the [AKS] to define

illegal remuneration under an indirect causation standard in the

criminal    context . . .   [while]    ascrib[ing]   a   more   stringent


                                - 14 -
causation standard in the civil context (e.g., an associated FCA

violation).").        But see Omni Healthcare, Inc. v. MD Spine Sols.

LLC, No. 18-cv-12558, 2025 WL 32676, at *8–9 (D. Mass. Jan. 6,

2025) (concluding that the phrase "resulting from" in the 2010

amendment requires a showing of but-for causation).

            We   do    not    follow   the   government's   logic.     As   the

government concedes, the words "resulting from" require proof of

some type of actual causality.               See Burrage, 571 U.S. at 211

("'Results       from'       imposes . . .      a   requirement   of   actual

causality.").      Hence, the question posed here is whether the type

of actual causality required is (as in ordinary course) but-for

causation. AKS liability, by contrast, does not require any causal

link between an inducement and any payment. See 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-

7b(b)(2).    So, the premise that the 2010 amendment's causation

requirement must track that of the AKS fails to get out of the

starting blocks.

            Nor is this surprising.             When Congress wants to make a

violation of one statute or statutory section generate liability

under another statute or section, it may or may not require proof

of added elements not required to prove the predicate violation.

Wire fraud, for example, is a federal offense that is necessary

but not sufficient for establishing additional liability under the

Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.                  18

U.S.C. §§ 1961-1962.            Similarly, certain firearm offenses can


                                       - 15 -
generate additional liability under the Armed Career Criminal Act,

but only if the defendant has three previous convictions for

violent felonies or serious drug offenses.             18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).

So, the mere fact that one liability is built on another says

nothing about whether any additional elements are required to

establish the subsequent liability.          Moreover, if Congress wants

to make a violation of one statute a per se violation of another,

it can easily say so.        See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 1692l(a) (stating

that violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act also

constitute violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act); 16

U.S.C. § 2465 (stating that violations of the Antarctic Mineral

Resources    Protection     Act   also   constitute      violations   of     the

Antarctic Marine Living Resources Convention Act).

            Nor does the addition of a causation element in the 2010

amendment leave the AKS any less able to pursue its "animating

principle."    Rather, by establishing a new pathway to liability

for AKS violations, the 2010 amendment clearly furthers the aims

of the AKS.     The only question is how much further and on what

terms that added support extends.

            So, our interpretative challenge is to select among

alternative    forms   of    causation,     one   of    which    (but-for)    is

presumptively correct, and all of which require some proof of

"actual causality."        See Burrage, 571 U.S. at 211, 217; see also

Paroline,     572   U.S.     at   458-59    (adopting       an   "alternative


                                   - 16 -
causa[tion]" standard where the defendant played an "indisputable

role . . . in the causal process"). As to that choice, the absence

of   any    causation     requirement      in   establishing        AKS   liability

provides little interpretative insight.

                So framed, our interpretative inquiry does not preclude

(at least in theory) a less ambitious version of the government's

argument:       Because no causation is required to establish criminal

AKS liability, then that suggests that "not much" causation -- that

is to say, causation short of but-for causation -- should be needed

for civil FCA liability. But even this more nuanced argument falls

short      of    supporting    the   government's        position    because     the

government's       proposed    standard     requires      no   proof      of   actual

causation at all.         Instead, the government posits that Medicare

claims for Eylea can "result from" a kickback even if that kickback

had no causal impact whatsoever on a patient’s decision to opt for

Eylea.     While Burrage and Paroline recognize that "resulting from"

may in some instances not require but-for causation, they provide

no   license      to   read   "resulting   from"    as    requiring       no   actual

causality whatsoever.

                Finally, as Regeneron points out, it is not unheard of

for the same statute to impose different evidentiary burdens for

related civil and criminal claims.              See, e.g., McCool v. Strata

Oil Co., 972 F.2d 1452, 1466 (7th Cir. 1992) (noting that civil

RICO claims require proof of injury to a plaintiff, while criminal


                                     - 17 -
RICO prosecutions do not require injury and instead punish the

defendant's "participation in the pattern as a whole").               Here, the

criminal provisions of the AKS serve a different purpose than the

provisions linking an AKS violation to FCA falsity.                      Criminal

liability under the AKS exists "to protect patients from doctors

whose medical judgments might be clouded by improper financial

considerations."     See United States v. Patel, 778 F.3d 607, 612

(7th Cir. 2015).     So, it makes sense for the AKS to criminalize

even those kickbacks that do not ultimately cause a referral or

purchase.     By contrast, "the chief purpose" of the FCA's civil

penalties is "to provide for restitution to the government of money

taken from it by fraud."          United States v. Bornstein, 423 U.S.

303, 314 (1976) (quoting United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317

U.S. 537, 551 (1943)).      Furthermore, the FCA creates a civil cause

of action for multiple damages that can be initiated and prosecuted

by private individuals without any affirmative approval by the

government.    So, it also makes sense for the 2010 amendment to

render a claim false (for FCA purposes) only when a kickback is

the cause of that claim's submission to the government.

                                        2.

            That   brings   us   to    the     government's   next   contextual

argument, rooted in statutory history.               Before addressing that

second contextual argument, we follow the lead of the parties and

first   discuss    what   the    government      describes    as   the   "false-


                                      - 18 -
certification" theory linking the FCA and AKS.2 Under this theory,

a defendant violates the FCA when presenting (or causing to be

presented)    a   claim         that     misrepresents       compliance      with   a

"statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement" that "the

defendant    knows     is       material    to    the   [g]overnment's       payment

decision."    Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. United States, 579

U.S. 176, 181 (2016).

                                           a.

            Before the 2010 amendment, many courts broadly agreed

that AKS compliance could be a material precondition of Medicare

reimbursement.       See United States ex rel. Westmoreland v. Amgen,

Inc., 812 F. Supp. 2d 39, 54–55 (D. Mass. 2011) (collecting cases).

So, a defendant who falsely represented AKS compliance when seeking

a payment from Medicare could be liable under the FCA.                 See, e.g.,

United States ex rel. Kosenske v. Carlisle HMA, Inc., 554 F.3d 88,

94 (3d Cir. 2009) ("Falsely certifying compliance with the [AKS]

in   connection   with      a    claim     submitted    to   a   federally    funded

insurance program is actionable under the FCA.").




      2 The parties use the phrase "false-certification" to
describe the body of case law linking the FCA and AKS without
reference to the 2010 amendment.       Purely for the sake of
simplicity, we follow their lead.    However, we have previously
noted that the term "certification" never appears in the text of
the FCA and is more likely to "obscure than clarify the issues
before us." United States ex rel. Hutcheson v. Blackstone Med.,
Inc., 647 F.3d 377, 385–86 (1st Cir. 2011).


                                         - 19 -
            In United States ex rel. Hutcheson v. Blackstone Med.,

Inc., 647 F.3d 377 (1st Cir. 2011), we considered an FCA claim

that the defendant offered renumeration to doctors to use the

defendant's medical devices, and doctors and hospitals then sought

reimbursement for those medical devices from federal healthcare

programs.    We held that the defendant could be liable under the

FCA for causing the doctors and hospitals to submit false claims

even if the defendant itself submitted no claims and even though

the hospitals knew of no AKS violation.          Id. at 389-91.      We also

held that where a provider agreement and a hospital cost report

made clear that the government healthcare program would not pay

claims if the underlying transaction that gave rise to the claim

violated the AKS, the claim could be false under the FCA.                Id. at

392-94.   In so holding, we eschewed reliance on terms like "false

certification" that are not mentioned in the statute, see id. at

389-90,   but   we   reached   a   result    identical   to   what   a   false

certification theory would have produced.

            In sum, there is certainly a pathway to FCA liability

for an AKS violation when someone falsely represents compliance

with a material requirement that there be no AKS violation in

connection with the claim.         Under that pathway, it is not the AKS

violation itself that renders the claim false.           Rather, it is the

false representation that there is no AKS violation.             And, as we

will explain, it is that pathway which the government claims is


                                    - 20 -
relevant to its position on this appeal.     See also William A.

Escobar & Philip D. Robben, The False Claims Act, in 15 Business

& Commercial Litigation in Federal Courts §§ 160:1, :17 (Robert L.

Haig ed., 5th ed. 2022) (outlining the elements of a false-

certification claim).

                                b.

          We now turn to the government's argument about the

context provided by statutory history. At the outset, we reiterate

that Paroline appeared to define a "contextual" indication as a

signal of legislative intent derived from the text of the statute

when read as a whole.   See 572 U.S. at 456-58.   Paroline does not

clearly permit us to cite statutory history as a "contextual"

reason for deviating from the default but-for causation standard.

On the other hand, the Supreme Court has often relied on the

evolution of a statute over time as informative.        See, e.g.,

Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100, 104-07 (1941);

Van Buren v. United States, 593 U.S. 374, 392-93 (2021).    In any

event, even accepting the history of the statute's evolution as

potentially informative, we find the government's spin on that

history unconvincing.

          The government begins by noting that Congress passed the

2010 amendment against a backdrop of false-certification cases.

As explained above, those cases did not require proof of causation

to demonstrate falsity under the FCA; a material misrepresentation


                              - 21 -
of compliance with the AKS was enough.                The government further

argues that, when Congress passed the 2010 amendment, it did not

clearly intend to alter false-certification caselaw by imposing a

but-for causation requirement.        Cf. Midlantic Nat'l Bank v. N.J.

Dep't of Env't Prot., 474 U.S. 494, 501 (1986) ("The normal rule

of   statutory   construction    is     that    if    Congress   intends      for

legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created

concept, it makes that intent specific.").

            On both points, we agree.          But there is nothing in the

2010 amendment that requires proof of but-for causation in a false-

certification FCA case.    Rather, as the government itself points

out, the 2010 amendment "offer[s] a pathway to establish falsity

in FCA actions based on AKS violations without reliance on [the

false certification] theory."         The circuit courts that read the

2010 amendment as imposing a but-for causation requirement also

agree that the 2010 amendment did not disturb alternative theories

of FCA liability (e.g., false certification). See Cairns, 42 F.4th

at 836 (rejecting the argument that the 2010 amendment "codified"

pre-2010 false-certification law, and then limiting the but-for

causation   requirement   to    cases    where       "a   plaintiff   seeks   to

establish falsity or fraud through the 2010 amendment" (emphasis

added)); United States ex rel. Martin v. Hathaway, 63 F.4th 1043,

1053 (6th Cir. 2023) (agreeing with the Cairns court's analysis).




                                 - 22 -
           Nor is the causation requirement the only difference

between   false-certification    cases    and   claims    under   the   2010

amendment.   For example, under the false-certification theory, FCA

liability lies when a defendant falsely represents AKS compliance

on a federal agency form.       Hutcheson, 647 F.3d at 392.        But the

2010 amendment does not require any representation -- implied or

express -- of AKS compliance.       Instead, any AKS violation that

"results in a federal health care payment" gives rise to a "per se

false claim under the FCA."      Guilfoile, 913 F.3d at 190 (emphasis

added) (quoting Lutz, 853 F.3d at 135).          Furthermore, under the

implied false-certification theory, the government must show that

the defendant's misrepresentation of AKS compliance was material

to the government's payment decision. See Universal Health Servs.,

579 U.S. at 181.    There is no such materiality requirement for

claims brought under the 2010 amendment.         Guilfoile, 913 F.3d at

190.

           Put simply, claims under the 2010 amendment run on a

separate track than do claims under a false-certification theory.

There is no reason to think that, because false-certification

claims require no proof of causation, Congress therefore eschewed

any actual causation requirement under the 2010 amendment.          By its

own terms, the 2010 amendment requires some proof of causation;

the only question is what type of causation.             On that question,

the statutory history provides no reason to deviate from the


                                 - 23 -
ordinary course, in which we treat "resulting from" as requiring

but-for causation.

                                      3.

            At its last source of context, the government points to

the legislative history of the 2010 amendment.          Once more, nothing

in Paroline instructs that we may consider such evidence when

interpreting the phrase "resulting from."           But even presuming that

such evidence is relevant, the legislative history simply offers

too little to justify the government's position.

            The government primarily relies on a floor statement by

Senator    Ted   Kaufman,   who   sponsored   the    bill   that    originally

included what became the 2010 amendment.             See United States ex

rel. Kester v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 41 F. Supp. 3d 323, 332–33

(detailing the legislative genesis of the 2010 amendment). Senator

Kaufman stated that the provision would "ensure that all claims

resulting from illegal kickbacks are 'false or fraudulent,' even

when the claims are not submitted directly by the wrongdoers

themselves."     155 Cong. Rec. S10852-01 (2009), 2009 WL 3460582, at

*S10853.    So, an ostensible purpose of the 2010 amendment was to

circumvent an arguable weakness in the false-certification theory.

            Senator Kaufman himself appeared to cite an example of

this arguable weakness:       United States ex rel. Thomas v. Bailey,

No. 06CV00465, 2008 WL 4853630 (E.D. Ark. Nov. 6, 2008).                See 155

Cong.     Rec. S10852-01    (2009),    2009   WL     3460582,      at   *S10853


                                   - 24 -
(describing the facts of the case).        That case involved a surgeon

who received kickbacks from a medical device company to use their

cervical plating devices.      Thomas, 2008 WL 4853630, at *1–3.         The

hospital then submitted claims for reimbursement for the surgeon's

services, including the typical costs of products and devices

purchased for that type of procedure.       Id. at *3.   The court found

that Medicare claims submitted by the hospital were not false under

the FCA.   Id. at *13–14.      Because the hospital knew nothing about

the surgeon's AKS violations (and because it had only certified

its own AKS compliance "to the best of [its] knowledge"), the court

held that the requests for Medicare reimbursement were not false.

Id. at *10–13.

           According to Senator Kaufman, the 2010 amendment would

prevent something like this from happening again.           Under the 2010

amendment, the claims for the medical devices would still be deemed

false or fraudulent under the AKS, because they "result[ed] from"

the   surgeon's   acceptance    of   illicit   kickbacks.       155   Cong.

Rec. S10852-01 (2009), 2009 WL 3460582, at *S10853.             It would,

therefore, be no defense that the surgeon had never personally

certified compliance with the AKS.

           Nothing   about   Senator   Kaufman's   floor     statement   is

inconsistent with an interpretation of the 2010 amendment that

imposes but-for causation.        Rather, the floor statement simply

reinforces the government's view that the 2010 amendment creates


                                  - 25 -
a different "pathway to establish falsity in FCA actions based on

AKS   violations   without    reliance    on    [the   false-certification]

theory."    If a medical provider accepts kickbacks, and then

personally represents compliance with the AKS, then FCA liability

can flow from that false representation.               But if the medical

provider does not represent compliance with the AKS (expressly or

otherwise), then a claim submitted on that provider's behalf can

still be "per se false" under the 2010 amendment.            Guilfoile, 913

F.3d at 190 (quoting Lutz, 853 F.3d at 135).               That is, if the

government can show that the illicit kickback was a but-for cause

of the submitted claim, then the claim is "per se false" even

absent a false certification of AKS compliance.

           We   therefore    disagree    with   the    government   that   the

legislative history of the 2010 amendment requires us to interpret

the phrase "resulting from" as imposing something other than a

but-for causation standard.

                                    4.

           We respond, finally, to the government's contention that

it can "sometimes be difficult" to prove why a doctor prescribed

a particular drug.    We do not doubt that such proof may be more

difficult to nail down in some cases.           But the same could be said

about the requirement to prove other elements of a successful

action under the FCA, such as scienter.          See, e.g., United States

ex rel. Hart v. McKesson Corp., 96 F.4th 145, 160-62 (2d Cir. 2024)


                                  - 26 -
(finding that the defendant lacked the requisite scienter to bring

a claim under the FCA), cert. denied, 145 S. Ct. 163 (2024); United

States ex rel. Gugenheim v. Meridian Senior Living, LLC, 36 F.4th

173, 181-82 (4th Cir. 2022) (same).

           Nor is it the case that giving "resulting from" its

ordinary meaning renders it so difficult to establish liability

that the 2010 amendment would have no practical effect.                As we

have explained in this opinion, the 2010 amendment made it easier

to bring an FCA action for damages by creating a pathway that does

not require proof of a false certification.               And not even the

government argues that it will rarely be able to prove but-for

causation.   Indeed, in this very case, the government's position

is that it has proffered enough evidence to get to a jury on the

issue of but-for causation.         See U.S.'s Surreply to Regeneron's

Motion for Summary Judgment at 10, United States v. Regeneron

Pharms., Inc., No. 20-11217, 2023 WL 7016900 (D. Mass. Oct. 25,

2023) ("Even if the government were required to prove but-for

causation, it at least has identified sufficient evidence to defeat

summary judgment.").      And the district court ultimately agreed,

finding   that   the   government    had     alleged   enough   evidence   "to

withstand summary judgment on the issue of [but-for] causation."

See Regeneron, 2023 WL 6296393, at *12-14.




                                    - 27 -
                               IV.

          In sum, we find no convincing "textual or contextual"

reason to deviate from the default presumption that the phrase

"resulting from" as used in the 2010 amendment imposes a but-for

causation standard. We therefore hold that, to demonstrate falsity

under the 2010 amendment, the government must show that an illicit

kickback was the but-for cause of a submitted claim.

                               V.

          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district

court is affirmed.
