      Appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District

of Connecticut (Michael P. Shea, Judge).

      UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED,

AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.

      Keisha Reynolds appeals from a March 16, 2023 judgment of the United

States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Shea, J.) granting summary

judgment in favor of CT Transit, her former employer. Reynolds filed claims

under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., and the

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., alleging that she

was discriminated against and wrongfully terminated on the basis of her religion

and perceived disability. We assume the parties’ familiarity with the underlying

facts and the record of prior proceedings, to which we refer only as necessary to

explain our decision to affirm.

      “We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo

. . . resolv[ing] all ambiguities and draw[ing] all inferences against the moving

                                           2
party.” Garcia v. Hartford Police Dep’t, 706 F.3d 120, 126–27 (2d Cir. 2013)

(quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is proper only when, construing

the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant, “there is no genuine

dispute as to any material fact.” Id. at 126 (quotation marks omitted). But

“conclusory statements or mere allegations [are] not sufficient to defeat a

summary judgment motion.” Penn v. N.Y. Methodist Hosp., 884 F.3d 416, 423 (2d

Cir. 2018) (quotation marks omitted).

      On appeal, Reynolds acknowledges that she did not meet her burden in

opposing summary judgment on any of her claims. See Appellant’s Br. 27–29, 33;

see also Reynolds v. HNS Mgmt. Co., No. 20-CV-471, 2023 WL 2526532, at *9–11 (D.

Conn. Mar. 15, 2023). Instead, she argues that the District Court erred in denying

her request for appointment of pro bono counsel for purposes of opposing CT

Transit’s summary judgment motion and that, as a result, its summary judgment

ruling was rendered on an incomplete record. We are not persuaded. “A district

court’s decision not to request an attorney to represent an indigent civil plaintiff

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1) is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.”

Leftridge v. Conn. State Trooper Officer No. 1283, 640 F.3d 62, 68 (2d Cir. 2011)

(quotation marks omitted). A district court has “[b]road discretion . . . in



                                           3
deciding whether to appoint counsel pursuant to this provision.” Hodge v. Police

Officers, 802 F.2d 58, 60 (2d Cir. 1986).

      Reynolds argues that because the District Court had previously granted

her appointed counsel on several occasions, principles of “stare decisis” left her

with a “vested right” in appointed counsel for the remainder of the litigation.

Appellant’s Br. 25. In support of her argument based on stare decisis, however,

Reynolds does not cite any prior precedent to which we are or might be bound.

And her argument fails even if we construe her reference to “stare decisis” as

instead invoking the law of the case doctrine, which requires “that when a court

has ruled on an issue, that decision should generally be adhered to by that court

in subsequent stages in the same case . . . unless cogent and compelling reasons

militate otherwise.” United States v. Quintieri, 306 F.3d 1217, 1225 (2d Cir. 2002)

(quotation marks omitted). Here, the District Court never ruled that Reynolds

should be appointed pro bono counsel indefinitely. To the contrary, each time

the District Court appointed counsel, it did so for a “limited purpose” such as

drafting an amended complaint or assisting Reynolds in mediation or settlement.

See App’x 7, 9–12. The District Court’s decision to appoint Reynolds pro bono

counsel for various limited purposes throughout the proceedings below did not



                                            4
mean that she was permanently entitled to appointed counsel for all purposes.

See Machadio v. Apfel, 276 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir. 2002).

      The District Court denied without prejudice Reynolds’s request for

appointed counsel to assist her in opposing CT Transit’s summary judgment

motion both because it “[could not] conclude . . . that [Reynolds was] likely to

succeed on the merits of her claims” and because she failed to “demonstrate that

she is unable to obtain counsel.” App’x 13. A district court “properly denies [a]

plaintiff’s motion for counsel if it concludes that [her] chances of success are

highly dubious.” Leftridge, 640 F.3d at 69. Because we agree with the District

Court, based on our independent review of the record, that Reynolds “ha[d] little

chance of success on the merits, . . . the District Court did not abuse its discretion

in denying [her] motion for the appointment of counsel.” Carpenter v. Republic of

Chile, 610 F.3d 776, 780 (2d Cir. 2010).

      As to the merits, Reynolds did not adduce any evidence that CT Transit’s

proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for referring her for a fitness

examination and, after she failed to attend, medically disqualifying her, were

discriminatory or based on animus about her religious beliefs or any disability,

or were otherwise a pretext for discrimination. Nor, on appeal, does she point to



                                           5
any such evidence that she would have submitted had she been counseled. We

therefore affirm the District Court’s ruling that — based on the record evidence

— “no reasonable juror could infer that CT Transit’s decision to medically

disqualify and terminate Reynolds was discriminatory.” Reynolds, 2023 WL

2526532, at *9.

      We have considered Reynolds’s remaining arguments and conclude that

they are without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District

Court is AFFIRMED.
