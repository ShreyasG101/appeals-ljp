        2                     Opinion of the Court                23-13443

               Cheriese Johnson was not feeling well. So she went to the
        doctor—many times—complaining of a wide variety of
        symptoms. At these appointments, doctors diagnosed her with
        nearly a dozen ailments: ﬁbromyalgia, borderline lupus
        erythematosus, and epistaxis, just to name a few. What they did
        not diagnose was the disease she actually had—scleroderma, a rare
        autoimmune condition that causes hardening and thickening of
        the skin and other tissues. No one had suspected this diagnosis
        before it happened. And no one argues that the failure of diagnosis
        resulted from malpractice, bad faith, or evasion.
               But when Johnson ﬁled a scleroderma-based disability claim
        once she could no longer work, her insurance company denied it.
        The problem, as the insurer saw it, was that many of Johnson’s
        medical appointments took place during the three-month window
        before her policy went into eﬀect. Under Johnson’s policy,
        disability beneﬁts are not owed if they stem from “preexisting
        conditions” treated during that three-month lookback period.
               This case hinges on the exact terms of that policy, which
        deﬁned a preexisting condition as “any Sickness or Injury for which
        the Insured received medical Treatment, consultation, care or
        services, including diagnostic procedures, or took prescribed drugs
        or medicines.” See Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company
        Policy No. LTD 106119 (emphasis added). The italicized phrase is
        key—“for which.” Johnson says she could not have received
        medical treatment for scleroderma during the lookback period
        because no one even suspected she had that condition until much
USCA11 Case: 23-13443     Document: 36-1     Date Filed: 11/21/2025   Page: 3 of 36




        23-13443              Opinion of the Court                      3

        later. The insurance company takes a far broader view of the
        policy, and says no beneﬁts are due if Johnson was treated for any
        symptoms during the lookback period that were not inconsistent
        with scleroderma—even if no one thought she had that condition
        or intended to treat it.
               We agree with Johnson—the insurance company’s
        interpretation is wrong. The closer question is whether its
        interpretation is also unreasonable, a heightened requirement of
        this Circuit’s ERISA precedents. To be sure, the policy is likely
        susceptible to a multitude of reasonable readings. But we cannot
        conclude that the insurance company’s, which would deny
        coverage for a brain tumor if the doctor encouraged a patient with
        headaches to drink more water, is one of them. We reverse and
        remand.
                                        I.
               Cheriese Johnson began experiencing coughing and pain in
        her hands and feet in December 2015. Seven months later, in July
        2016, she was hired to work in human resources at The William
        Carter Company, “the most trusted name in baby, kids, and toddler
        clothing.” When she started the job, she bought a long-term
        disability insurance policy from Reliance Standard. The policy
        took eﬀect on October 12, 2016.
              By January 26, 2017—about four months after the policy
        kicked in—Johnson could no longer work. In insurance-speak, she
        was “totally disabled.” But because that happened within one year
        of the date that she became insured, Johnson was subject to the
USCA11 Case: 23-13443      Document: 36-1     Date Filed: 11/21/2025   Page: 4 of 36




        4                      Opinion of the Court               23-13443

        policy’s “Pre-existing Conditions Limitation,” which allowed
        Reliance Standard to deny beneﬁts if her disability was “(1) caused
        by; (2) contributed to by; or (3) resulting from; a Pre-existing
        Condition.” The policy went on to deﬁne “Pre-Existing Condition”
        as “any Sickness or Injury for which the Insured received medical
        Treatment, consultation, care or services, including diagnostic
        procedures, or took prescribed drugs or medicines,” during the
        lookback period of the “three (3) months immediately prior to the
        Insured’s eﬀective date of insurance.” All agree that the relevant
        “Sickness” here is scleroderma, and that the lookback period ran
        from July 12, 2016, through October 12, 2016.
                Johnson did receive quite a bit of medical care during that
        time:
            • On August 15, she was “seen in follow-up with assessments
              of fatigue, muscle weakness, nausea, and vomiting.” The
              nurse practitioner continued her prescriptions for
              Cyclobenzaprine and Zofran.
            • On August 23, she underwent an “upper gastrointestinal
              endoscopy,” which revealed “gastritis and a hiatus hernia.”
            • On September 6, she was treated for “vomiting, nose bleeds,
              memory loss, body aches, and joint swelling.” She was
              diagnosed     with    Helicobacter       pylori,   epistaxis,
              gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, edema, and hypertension,
              and she was given several prescriptions, none of which were
              for scleroderma.

        23-13443              Opinion of the Court                     5

           • On September 13, she sought treatment for a “post-syncopal
             episode and low blood sugar.” She was diagnosed with
             bronchitis, fatigue, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, and
             sleep apnea.
           • On September 30, she was treated for “numbness, coldness,
             and pain involving all four extremities, nausea, vomiting,
             forgetfulness, cognitive impairment, fatigue, inability to
             control bowels, blurred vision, fever, dropping things
             frequently, headaches, decreased appetite, syncope,
             dizziness, generalized aching, swelling of feet and hands,
             and loss of motor skills.”
               All told, Johnson presented over a dozen symptoms when
        she visited her many doctors. Most were garden-variety ailments:
           •   nausea
           •   vomiting
           •   cough
           •   fatigue
           •   swelling of feet and hands
           •   muscle weakness
           •   cognitive impairment
           •   Raynaud-type symptoms
           •   chronic pain
           •   gastroesophageal reﬂux disease
           •   hypertension
           •   decreased appetite

        6                       Opinion of the Court               23-13443

            •   syncope
            •   dizziness
            •   generalized aching
            •   a loss of motor skills.
               These symptoms led to no fewer than ten diagnoses, none
        of which were scleroderma: (1) ﬁbromyalgia; (2) borderline lupus
        erythematosus; (3) probable somatoform disorder; (4) helicobacter
        pylori; (5) epistaxis; (6) gastroesophageal reﬂux disease; (7) edema;
        (8) hypertension; (9) sleep apnea; and (10) bronchitis.
               In February 2017—four months after the lookback period
        ended—Johnson underwent a lung biopsy to further investigate
        her symptoms. The biopsy led to a diagnosis of scleroderma, a
        “rare, chronic autoimmune disease in which normal tissue is
        replaced with dense, thick ﬁbrous tissue.” Symptoms typically
        include “joint pain and stiﬀness, persistent cough, shortness of
        breath, digestive and gastrointestinal problems, and fatigue.”
        Neither Johnson nor any of her many doctors—a neurologist,
        pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, and rheumatologist—ever
        suspected that she had scleroderma before the lung surgery.
               Eight months later, Johnson ﬁled a claim with Reliance
        Standard for long-term disability beneﬁts stemming from her
        scleroderma symptoms. Denied. Johnson appealed that decision,
        arguing that because no one suspected that she had the disease
        until after the lookback period ended, it could not qualify as a
        preexisting condition. Though scleroderma is usually treated by
        rheumatologists because it is fundamentally an inﬂammatory
USCA11 Case: 23-13443      Document: 36-1       Date Filed: 11/21/2025     Page: 7 of 36

        condition, Reliance Standard retained an endocrinologist—a
        doctor specializing in hormones—to review Johnson’s ﬁle. The
        endocrinologist concluded that the “symptoms/ﬁndings do
        support a reported diagnosis of scleroderma.” So Reliance
        Standard upheld the denial of Johnson’s claim “on the basis that the
        claimed disability [was] caused by, contributed to by, or the result
        of a pre-existing condition”—namely, scleroderma.
               Johnson sued Reliance Standard under the Employee
        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), arguing that her
        long-term disability plan entitled her to beneﬁts. She also ﬁled a
        motion with the district court requesting judgment on the
        administrative record, while Reliance Standard moved for
        summary judgment. The district court denied her motion and
        granted summary judgment to Reliance Standard. Johnson now
        appeals.
                                          II.
               We review a district court’s ruling aﬃrming or reversing a
        plan administrator’s ERISA beneﬁts decision de novo, “applying the
        same legal standards that governed the district court’s decision.”
        Goldfarb v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 106 F.4th 1100, 1105 (11th
        Cir. 2024) (quotation omitted).
                                         III.
               ERISA “permits a person denied benefits under an employee
        benefit plan to challenge that denial in federal court.” Metro. Life
        Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U.S. 105, 108 (2008). The statute was enacted
        to “promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in
USCA11 Case: 23-13443     Document: 36-1      Date Filed: 11/21/2025    Page: 8 of 36

        employee benefit plans, and to protect contractually defined
        benefits.” Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 113
        (1989) (quotations and citation omitted). To implement those
        goals, “federal courts have developed a body of federal common
        law to govern the review, interpretation, and enforcement of
        ERISA beneﬁts plans.” Goldfarb, 106 F.4th at 1105. That includes
        distinct burdens of proof. For example, when “the insurer claims
        that a speciﬁc policy exclusion applies to deny the insured
        beneﬁts”—the situation we have here—the burden falls on the
        insurer, who “generally must prove the exclusion prevents
        coverage.” Horton v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 141 F.3d 1038,
        1040 (11th Cir. 1998). And this Circuit adds a six-step sequence
        governing review of a plan administrator’s beneﬁts decision:
              (1) Apply the de novo standard to determine whether
              the claim administrator’s beneﬁts-denial decision is
              “wrong” (i.e., the court disagrees with the
              administrator’s decision); if it is not, then end the
              inquiry and aﬃrm the decision.
              (2) If the administrator’s decision in fact is “de novo
              wrong,” then determine whether he was vested with
              discretion in reviewing claims; if not, end judicial
              inquiry and reverse the decision.
              (3) If the administrator’s decision is “de novo wrong”
              and he was vested with discretion in reviewing claims,
              then determine whether “reasonable” grounds
USCA11 Case: 23-13443          Document: 36-1           Date Filed: 11/21/2025           Page: 9 of 36

                supported it (hence, review his decision under the
                more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard).
                (4) If no reasonable grounds exist, then end the
                inquiry and reverse the administrator’s decision; if
                reasonable grounds do exist, then determine if he
                operated under a conﬂict of interest.
                (5) If there is no conﬂict, then end the inquiry and
                aﬃrm the decision.
                (6) If there is a conﬂict, the conﬂict should merely be
                a factor for the court to take into account when
                determining whether an administrator’s decision was
                arbitrary and capricious.
        Blankenship v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 644 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir. 2011).
              We stand alone in applying this framework.1 See J.
        Christopher Collins et al., ERISA Survey of Federal Circuits 15–17;
        78–80; 153–57; 222–26; 295–301; 355–57; 412–16; 449–53; 505–09;
        594–602; 660–63; 738–45 (Brooks R. Magratten ed. 2024)


        1 More typical is the approach of six of our sister circuits, each of which simply

        applies the classic arbitrary-and-capricious test if the plan administrator is
        vested with discretion. See Colby v. Union Sec. Ins. Co. & Mgmt. Co. for
        Merrimack Anesthesia Assocs. Long Term Disability Plan, 705 F.3d 58, 61 (1st Cir.
        2013); Pagan v. NYNEX Pension Plan, 52 F.3d 438, 441 (2d Cir. 1995); Dowling v.
        Pension Plan for Salaried Emps. of Union Pac. Corp. & Affiliates, 871 F.3d 239, 245–
        46 (3d Cir. 2017); Elliott v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 473 F.3d 613, 617 (6th Cir. 2006);
        Holmstrom v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 615 F.3d 758, 766 (7th Cir. 2010); Chambers v.
        Fam. Health Plan Corp., 100 F.3d 818, 825 & n.1 (10th Cir. 1996).

        (describing each circuit’s approach). And candidly, while this six-
        step dance is likely unnecessarily complex (and may even obscure
        the lawful result in certain cases), we apply it all the same because
        it is our binding precedent. See In re Lambrix, 776 F.3d 789, 794 (11th
        Cir. 2015).
               Here, the answers at steps one and two are relatively
        straightforward: Reliance Standard’s decision is de novo wrong and
        the company plainly has interpretive authority. But our analysis
        ends after step three because Reliance Standard’s interpretation of
        the policy is not only de novo wrong, it is also unreasonable: it
        overlooks the distinction between receiving medical care for
        symptoms that are not inconsistent with a preexisting condition
        and receiving medical care for the preexisting condition itself. See
        Blankenship, 644 F.3d at 1355.
                                          A.
               At step one, we apply “ERISA’s common law” and consider
        whether Reliance Standard’s beneﬁts-denial decision was wrong.
        See Tippitt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 457 F.3d 1227, 1234–35
        (11th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted); Blankenship, 644 F.3d at 1355.
        The answer to that question depends on whether the company
        correctly interpreted the terms of Johnson’s disability policy. It did
        not.
               As always, we begin with “the plain and ordinary meaning
        of the policy terms to interpret the contract.” Alexandra H. v.
        Oxford Health Ins. Freedom Access Plan, 833 F.3d 1299, 1307 (11th Cir.
        2016). Johnson’s policy states that beneﬁts “will not be paid” for a
USCA11 Case: 23-13443     Document: 36-1     Date Filed: 11/21/2025    Page: 11 of 36




        23-13443              Opinion of the Court                       11

        disability that is “caused by,” “contributed to by,” or “resulting
        from” a preexisting condition. Here, a preexisting condition is any
        illness “for which the Insured received medical Treatment,
        consultation, care or services, including diagnostic procedures, or
        took prescribed drugs or medicines” during the lookback period.
        See Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company Policy No. LTD
        106119 (emphasis added). In plain speak: the preexisting condition
        exclusion is triggered when someone receives medical treatment
        “for” a “Sickness or Injury” during the lookback period.
                A lot hinges on for—a word that “connotes intent.” Lawson
        ex rel. Lawson v. Fortis Ins. Co., 301 F.3d 159, 165 (3d Cir. 2002)
        (Alito, J.). That word is used “to indicate the object, aim, or
        purpose of an action or activity.” See For, The American Heritage
        Dictionary of the English Language (5th ed. 2016); see also For,
        Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1986) (“for” is “used
        as a function word to indicate purpose”). As Black’s Law
        Dictionary puts it: the word for “connotes the end with reference
        to which anything is, acts, serves, or is done.” For, Black’s Law
        Dictionary (5th ed. 1979). Or: “In consideration of which, in view
        of which, or with reference to which, anything is done or takes
        place.” Id. Texts using the word for, then, have “an implicit intent
        requirement” baked into them. Lawson, 301 F.3d at 165.
               Applying that meaning to Johnson’s case, we have little
        diﬃculty concluding that Reliance Standard’s beneﬁt-denial
        decision was wrong. No one “intended or even thought” to treat
        Johnson “for” scleroderma during the lookback period. See id. And

        12                     Opinion of the Court                  23-13443

        as then-Judge Alito explained, “it is hard to see how a doctor can
        provide treatment ‘for’ a condition without knowing what that
        condition is or that it even exists.” Id. Because neither Johnson
        “nor her physicians either knew or suspected that the symptoms
        she was experiencing were in any way connected with”
        scleroderma, it would make little sense to say that she was treated
        for scleroderma. McLeod v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 372 F.3d
        618, 620 (3d Cir. 2004). Simply put: giving the language in
        Johnson’s policy its “ordinary and popular” meaning requires us to
        conclude that she is entitled to beneﬁts. See Pitcher v. Principal Mut.
        Life Ins. Co., 93 F.3d 407, 411 (7th Cir. 1996) (quotation omitted).
               We reach this conclusion without a thumb on the scale in
        Johnson’s favor. To be sure, part of the federal common law for
        ERISA is that “the rule of contra proferentem requires us to construe
        any ambiguities against the drafter.” Alexandra H., 833 F.3d at 1307.
        But we invoke this interpretive canon only when “a term is
        ambiguous” and both sides advance “reasonable interpretations
        that can be fairly made.” Id. Because Reliance Standard’s
        interpretation falls far short, we see no need to resort to contra
        proferentem to buttress our straightforward conclusion. See
        Pitcher, 93 F.3d at 412, 418 (contra proferentem unnecessary to
        conclude that plaintiﬀ was not treated “for” cancer when neither
        she “nor her physician, at this juncture, had reason to suspect that”
        she had it).

        23-13443               Opinion of the Court                        13

              In short: because scleroderma was not a condition for which
        Johnson received medical treatment during the lookback period,
        Reliance Standard was wrong to deny coverage.
                                         B.
                So we move on to step two, asking whether the policy vested
        Reliance Standard “with discretion in reviewing claims.” See
        Blankenship, 644 F.3d at 1355. The policy must “expressly” give
        Reliance Standard “discretionary authority to make eligibility
        determinations or to construe the plan’s terms.” Kirwan v. Marriott
        Corp., 10 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 1994) (emphasis omitted). That
        standard is high, but here the question is not close. Johnson’s policy
        states that Reliance Standard “has the discretionary authority to
        interpret the Plan and the insurance policy and to determine
        eligibility for beneﬁts.” We thus continue on our six-step journey.
                                         C.
               Step three, often the heart of the ERISA analysis in this
        Circuit, is decisive here too. Even though Reliance Standard’s
        decision was wrong, because the ﬁrm was vested with discretion in
        reviewing claims, we protect that discretion by evaluating whether
        “reasonable” grounds supported its decision. See Blankenship, 644
        F.3d at 1355. That means we review Reliance Standard’s decision
USCA11 Case: 23-13443       Document: 36-1         Date Filed: 11/21/2025       Page: 14 of 36




        14                        Opinion of the Court                     23-13443

        “under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.”2
        Id.
               Make no mistake: this standard really is deferential. So long
        as a reasonable basis for denying coverage exists, the
        administrator’s decision “must be upheld as not being arbitrary or
        capricious, even if there is evidence that would support a contrary
        decision.” Jett v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ala., Inc., 890 F.2d 1137,
        1140 (11th Cir. 1989). As a leading treatise explains, we cannot
        substitute our own judgment for that of the ﬁduciary. See 1A
        Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance § 7:60 (3d ed. 2023).
               Still, “deferential review is not no review,” and “deference
        need not be abject.” Hess v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 274 F.3d
        456, 461 (7th Cir. 2001) (alteration adopted and quotation omitted).
        There will be times when “the plain language or structure of the
        plan or simple common sense will require the court to pronounce
        an administrator’s determination arbitrary and capricious.” Id.
        This is one of those times.
                Reliance Standard’s interpretation of the preexisting
        condition language as applied to Johnson’s claim is unreasonable
        because it completely elides the distinction between receiving
        medical care for symptoms not inconsistent with a preexisting
        condition and receiving medical care for a preexisting condition
        itself. Reliance Standard agrees that its interpretation of the plan

        2 In this context, there is “no substantive distinction between the terms

        ‘arbitrary and capricious’ and ‘abuse of discretion.’” Shaw v. Conn. Gen. Life
        Ins. Co., 353 F.3d 1276, 1284–85 n.7 (11th Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).
USCA11 Case: 23-13443         Document: 36-1          Date Filed: 11/21/2025           Page: 15 of 36




        23-13443                    Opinion of the Court                                 15

        means that “any symptom experienced” before the ultimate
        diagnosis would allow the company to deny coverage “so long as
        the symptom was not later deemed inconsistent with that
        condition.” McLeod, 372 F.3d at 625 (rejecting this view). It is no
        exaggeration to say that under Reliance Standard’s view, a patient
        told to drink more water because her headache was likely caused
        by her dehydration has been treated for cancer if she turns out to
        have a brain tumor. And that is true even if dehydration really was
        the root cause of the headache. Headaches, after all, are a
        symptom of both brain tumors and dehydration. So, to Reliance
        Standard, treatment for a headache during the lookback period
        converts any disease or condition that causes headaches into a
        preexisting condition under the policy. We do not overstate the
        company’s view—Reliance Standard doubled down on it at oral
        argument.3
               This position is unreasonable—full stop. It “interprets the
        plan in a manner inconsistent with its plain words,” which speak in
        terms of an “illness or disease,” not a symptom theoretically
        consistent with having an illness or disease. See McCauley v. First


        3 This point alone refutes the suggestion that we are “attacking a strawman.”

        Dissenting Op. at 7. No. We are taking Reliance Standard at its word. In fact,
        the dissent outright embraces this interpretation, positing that a football player
        who undergoes concussion protocols has received medical care “for” cancer if
        a CT scan happens to reveal an unsuspected brain tumor. Id. at 5. Under the
        dissent’s logic, the football player is also out of luck if medical staff told him to
        drink more water to rehydrate after a long match. McLeod rejected this exact
        interpretation. See 372 F.3d at 625.

        16                      Opinion of the Court                  23-13443

        Unum Life Ins. Co., 551 F.3d 126, 133 (2d Cir. 2008) (quotation
        omitted). Even Bullwinkel v. New England Mutual Life Insurance—
        Reliance Standard’s best case—rejected this cramped
        interpretation. 18 F.3d 429 (7th Cir. 1994). As the Seventh Circuit
        explained, a person does not have a preexisting condition merely
        because he purchased generic cough medicine in one month and
        learned about his lung cancer in the next. Id. at 433.
               To be sure, Reliance Standard is right that Johnson presented
        many symptoms to her doctors during the lookback period, some
        of which were not inconsistent with scleroderma. 4 But recall that
        these symptoms—things like nausea, vomiting, cough, fatigue, and
        swelling—were vague and general, pointing to any variety of other
        ailments. And though Johnson received no fewer than ten
        diagnoses, scleroderma was conspicuously absent from the list.
        Indeed, “none of the tests” Johnson underwent during this process
        “ever linked the symptoms she was experiencing” to scleroderma,
        so doctors had no suspicion that she might have it. See McLeod, 372
        F.3d at 628. And that means there could be no “intention” on the
        part of Johnson’s doctors to treat her for scleroderma. Id. None.
        Put another way: because there is “no evidence that the possibility
        that” Johnson had scleroderma “ever entered the minds of ”
        Johnson’s doctors, “it would not make sense” to say that she



        4 Curiously, Reliance Standard’s denial letters never specified which of
        Johnson’s symptoms were theoretically consistent with scleroderma. But
        Johnson does not dispute that at least one of them was.
USCA11 Case: 23-13443          Document: 36-1          Date Filed: 11/21/2025           Page: 17 of 36

        received medical advice or treatment for scleroderma.5 Lawson, 301
        F.3d at 166.
               To illustrate, suppose an insured goes to his doctor during
        the lookback period complaining of coughing and fatigue. Seeing
        and suspecting nothing grievously wrong, the doctor diagnoses
        him with the ﬂu and prescribes Nyquil. But a month later—after
        the lookback period has ended—he starts coughing up blood and
        is soon diagnosed with tuberculosis. Did the doctor treat the
        patient for tuberculosis a month earlier? Of course not. And we
        cannot see how it would be reasonable to say yes. Yet under
        Reliance Standard’s reading of the policy, it could (would) deny
        beneﬁts because the coughing and fatigue were symptoms not
        inconsistent with the unsuspected tuberculosis—rendering the
        tuberculosis a preexisting condition and counting the Nyquil as a
        treatment for the unsuspected tuberculosis.6
               This sweeping interpretation of “for” is outside the bounds
        of reasonableness. The problem with Reliance Standard’s “ex post


        5 We also note that all evidence points to consistent good-faith efforts by

        Johnson to get a diagnosis.
        6 Recasting Reliance Standard’s argument, the dissent insists that “there is

        more than ‘consistency’ between what Johnson was treated for and
        scleroderma; they are the same thing.” Dissenting Op. at 8. If that’s the
        argument, we are not sure what to make of it. Even though Johnson received
        treatment for fatigue, nausea, and other symptoms that can be consistent with
        scleroderma, the symptoms are not the disease—an indication of something is
        not the thing itself. In fact, it is hard to find a condition for which fatigue is not
        a symptom. So it makes no sense to say that fatigue is “the same thing” as
USCA11 Case: 23-13443      Document: 36-1       Date Filed: 11/21/2025       Page: 18 of 36




        18                      Opinion of the Court                    23-13443

        facto analysis is that a whole host of symptoms occurring before a
        ‘correct’ diagnosis is rendered, or even suspected, can presumably
        be tied to the condition once it has been diagnosed.” McLeod, 372
        F.3d at 625. And, again, that’s true even if the earlier symptom is
        not ultimately connected to the eventual diagnosis. Indeed, under
        Reliance Standard’s view, “any time a policy holder seeks medical
        care of any kind during the look-back period, the ‘symptom’ that
        prompted him to seek the care could potentially be deemed a
        symptom of a pre-existing condition, as long as it was later deemed
        consistent with symptoms generally associated with the condition
        eventually diagnosed.” Id.
               That view is arbitrary and capricious. As then-Judge Alito
        explained, “considering treatment for symptoms of a not-yet-
        diagnosed condition as equivalent to treatment of the underlying
        condition ultimately diagnosed might open the door for insurance
        companies to deny coverage for any condition the symptoms of
        which were treated during the exclusionary period.” Lawson, 301
        F.3d at 166. Here, that “might” becomes a “would.” See id. And to
        bless “such backward-looking reinterpretation of symptoms to
        support claims denials would so greatly expand the deﬁnition of
        preexisting condition as to make that term meaningless: any prior
        symptom not inconsistent with the ultimate diagnosis would
        provide a basis for denial.” Id. (quotation omitted). Other courts
        agree. See, e.g., McLeod, 372 F.3d at 628; Est. of Ermenc ex rel. Ermenc


        scleroderma or coughing is “the same thing” as tuberculosis, any more than
        to say that a wet umbrella is “the same thing” as a hurricane.

        v. Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co., 585 N.W.2d 679, 682 (Wis. Ct. App. 1998);
        Karagon v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 228 N.W.2d 515, 516 (Mich. Ct. App.
        1975).
               In the end, Reliance Standard urges us to apply a diﬀerent
        policy than the one it wrote, reading it as if it barred coverage for
        claims arising from conditions that may have originated or existed
        during the lookback period, not conditions that were treated
        during that period. And its reading may be even broader than
        that—denying coverage based on symptoms that occurred during
        the lookback period, whether or not those symptoms were
        connected to the eventual disability claim. So despite our
        deferential posture, we decline the invitation to stretch the text of
        Johnson’s policy beyond what it can reasonably bear.
                Reliance Standard’s counterarguments do not persuade.
        The company chieﬂy relies on this Court’s unpublished decision in
        Ferrizzi v. Reliance Standard Life Insurance, 792 F. App’x 678 (11th Cir.
        2019) (unpublished). We start by pointing out that unpublished
        cases are not precedential and do not bind us. See Otto Candies, LLC
        v. Citigroup Inc., 137 F.4th 1158, 1195 (11th Cir. 2025). But even
        putting that aside, Ferrizzi does not move the needle.
              That panel dealt with a nearly identical disability policy to
        the one we have here. See Ferrizzi, 792 F. App’x at 684. The
        question was whether “substance abuse/drug dependency” was a
        condition “for which” the claimant received medical treatment
        during the lookback period. Id. The plaintiﬀ said no, asserting that
        he was neither diagnosed with nor treated for this illness during
USCA11 Case: 23-13443         Document: 36-1         Date Filed: 11/21/2025          Page: 20 of 36

        that time. See id. This Court rejected that argument with little
        analysis, concluding that the policy at issue did not “require a
        formal diagnosis during the lookback period.” Id. at 685. That’s it.
               We do not ﬁnd Ferrizzi instructive. For one, Johnson, unlike
        Ferrizzi, does not say that there must be a “formal diagnosis”
        during the lookback period. See id. at 684–85. Nor do we—
        suspecting and treating for a condition is enough. And the doctors
        in Ferrizzi did suspect that he had a substance-dependency illness
        during the lookback period. Id. at 685. Indeed, Ferrizzi “received
        ‘medical treatment’ for substance abuse/drug dependency on at
        least one occasion during the lookback period.” Id. Not so for
        Johnson. Ferrizzi is entirely consistent with our holding here, and
        we do not understand the dissent’s insistence that it is not.7 See
        Dissenting Op. at 6–7.


        7 Nor do the dissenting opinion’s comparator cases make the point the opinion

        suggests. Most obvious is Mogil v. California Physicians Corp., 267 Cal. Rptr.
        487, 492 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990). The policy at issue there defined “Pre-existing
        Condition” to exist where: (i) “any professional advice or treatment of a
        Physician, or any medical supply (including but not limited to prescription
        drugs or medicines) was obtained for that Disability” or (ii) “the Disability was
        manifest to the Covered Person.” Id. at 488 (emphasis added). The court’s
        decision turned on (ii), not (i): the insured’s treatment was not covered
        because her cancer “manifested” itself prior to the policy’s start date. See id. at
        491–94. The policy here has no such provision. Likewise, Lincoln Income Life
        Insurance v. Milton involved an exclusion that barred coverage where the
        insured’s disease “first commenced or became evident after the effective date
        of the contract.” 412 S.W.2d 291, 292 (Ark. 1967). And the policy in Kirchstein
        v. Kentucky Central Life Insurance defined “sickness” broadly—to include “all
        complications arising therefrom or reoccurrences thereof.” 556 So. 2d 1190,
USCA11 Case: 23-13443        Document: 36-1         Date Filed: 11/21/2025        Page: 21 of 36




        23-13443                  Opinion of the Court                               21

               Reliance Standard’s emphasis on the Seventh Circuit’s
        Bullwinkel decision is similarly misplaced. 18 F.3d 429. There, the
        plaintiﬀ went to her doctor during the lookback period because of
        a lump on her breast. Id. at 430. The doctor was “concerned about
        the possibility of cancer” and referred her to a surgeon. Id. After
        the lookback period ended, a surgeon completed a biopsy on the
        lump and conﬁrmed that it was cancerous. Id. The plaintiﬀ sought
        treatment, but the insurance company denied coverage, classifying
        the cancer as a preexisting condition. Id. The Seventh Circuit
        agreed: because the “lump was discovered in September to be
        cancerous,” it took “from this fact that the lump was also
        cancerous in July,” during the lookback period when her physician
        suspected that disease. Id. at 432. In so concluding, the panel
        emphasized that the plaintiﬀ’s symptoms “were not trivial and
        inconclusive—like a cough or a rash which might imply any of a
        variety of maladies.” Id. Her doctor was concerned about cancer,
        and that made the diﬀerence.8




        1192 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990). Johnson’s policy lacks the symptoms-focused
        exclusions discussed in Mogil, Milton, and Kirchstein. These cases interpreting
        different policy language do not control here, and we cannot rewrite her
        policy to say what it does not.
        8 The Seventh Circuit itself has been clear that Bullwinkel did not go nearly as

        far as Reliance Standard suggests: Bullwinkel depended on its facts, and “was
        obviously not intended as an authorization for summary judgment in favor of

                This case is worlds apart. It involves a patient who exhibited
        “only non-speciﬁc symptoms and neither the patient nor the
        physician” suspected that the later-diagnosed illness was in play.
        Lawson, 301 F.3d at 166. To be sure, when a patient “seeks advice
        for a sickness with a speciﬁc concern in mind”—like the breast
        lump in Bullwinkel—“an intent to seek or provide treatment or
        advice ‘for’ a particular disease has been manifested.” Id.; see also
        Marshall v. UNUM Life Ins. Co., 13 F.3d 282, 283 (8th Cir. 1994)
        (chronic fatigue syndrome was a preexisting condition when
        plaintiﬀ “sought treatment for chronic fatigue” during the
        lookback period). But where, as here, the doctor “had no reason
        to suspect, much less believe, that his patient was aﬄicted” with a
        later-diagnosed condition, the patient did not receive treatment
        “for” it.9 Pitcher, 93 F.3d at 415–16.
                That’s also why the dissent’s interpretation fails. To start, it
        is not the one pressed by Reliance Standard. Plus, the dissent puts
        too much weight on the words “diagnostic procedures,” which are
        completely consistent with our interpretation of the policy. See
        Dissenting Op. at 4–5. The policy makes clear that diagnostic

        9 The other cases in the dissent’s page-long string cite offer little in the way of

        support. See Dissenting Op. at 8–9. One involved a patient who exhibited
        “strong indications” of a particular illness. See LoCoco v. Med. Sav. Ins. Co., 530
        F.3d 442, 448 (6th Cir. 2008). Another involved a patient whose doctor had
        “reasonable cause to believe that [he] had multiple sclerosis.” Dowdall v. Com.
        Travelers Mut. Accident Ass’n of Am., 181 N.E.2d 594, 595 (Mass. 1962). In these
        cases, the insured’s sickness manifested in the form of “a distinct symptom or
        condition from which one learned in medicine can diagnose the disease.” Id.
        at 596. The same cannot be said for Johnson.

        procedures “for” a particular disease trigger the policy’s preexisting
        conditions exclusion. So if a doctor who suspects cancer performs
        a biopsy—a diagnostic procedure “for” cancer—that procedure
        counts under this contract. But a doctor who suspects nothing in
        particular cannot perform a procedure “for” a speciﬁc condition.
        The “interpretive problem” the dissent identiﬁes is thus one of its
        own making. See id. at 5.
               It would be “awkward at best” to say that Johnson “received
        treatment” for scleroderma because “there is no connection
        between the treatment or advice received and the sickness.”
        Lawson, 301 F.3d at 166. We reject this unnatural reading of her
        policy. So despite our deferential standard of review, we conclude
        that Reliance Standard’s denial of benefits was arbitrary and
        capricious because its interpretation was “contrary to the clear
        language of the plan.” See Lockhart v. United Mine Workers of Am.
        1974 Pension Tr., 5 F.3d 74, 78 (4th Cir. 1993) (alteration adopted
        and quotation omitted); McLeod, 372 F.3d at 628 (district court
        “erred as a matter of law” when it misread clear policy language).
                                    *    *       *
               We emphasize again that we are not charged with ﬁnding
        the best interpretation of Johnson’s policy. There are likely a range
        of reasonable interpretations; it’s just that Reliance Standard’s is
        not one of them. It warps the “plain and ordinary meaning” of the
        policy language, converting a preexisting-condition exclusion into
        a preexisting-symptom exclusion. Alexandra H., 833 F.3d at 1307.
        The company’s reading of the plan was arbitrary and capricious, so

        23-13443          WILLIAM PRYOR, C.J., Dissenting                    1

        WILLIAM PRYOR, Chief Judge, Dissenting:
               As far back as the record reflects, Cheriese Johnson has ex-
        perienced several ailments and symptoms. Since October 2015, she
        has suffered from joint pain and swelling, shortness of breath, fa-
        tigue, chronic vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, and coughing—
        to name a few. She regularly sought treatment for those symptoms
        with various health specialists and was prescribed several medica-
        tions for them. Later, in October 2016, Johnson became insured for
        disability under a policy administered by Reliance Standard Life In-
        surance Company. Unfortunately, Johnson’s symptoms did not
        disappear after she became insured—they only progressed. In Oc-
        tober 2017, Johnson filed a claim with Reliance for disability based
        on the symptoms she had experienced for two years. In the claim
        form, Johnson’s physician stated that those symptoms were the re-
        sult of scleroderma—a sickness that had gone undiagnosed until
        four months after the policy’s lookback period ended but that in-
        volves the very symptoms he had treated every few months since
        April 2016, well before the lookback period. Reliance denied John-
        son’s claim because, as her physician admitted, she had suffered
        from and was treated for the symptoms of scleroderma long before
        she became covered. Under the policy, Johnson could not receive
        benefits for a “Pre-existing Condition.” Yet, the majority holds that
        Reliance unreasonably found that Johnson’s scleroderma was a pre-
        existing condition. It does so by ignoring the whole text of John-
        son’s policy, the record facts, and the settled purpose of pre-existing
        condition exclusions, and it dismisses as unreasoned our earlier

        decision interpreting the same policy to require the opposite result.
        I respectfully dissent.
               As always, when reviewing an administrator’s interpretation
        of a policy, we begin with “the plain and ordinary meaning of the
        policy terms.” Alexandra H. v. Oxford Health Ins. Inc. Freedom Access
        Plan, 833 F.3d 1299, 1307 (11th Cir. 2016). The policy excludes cov-
        erage for benefits “caused by,” “contributed to by,” or “resulting
        from” a “Pre-Existing Condition.” And it defines “Pre-Existing
        Condition” as any sickness or injury “for which the Insured re-
        ceived medical Treatment, consultation, care or services, including
        diagnostic procedures, or took prescribed drugs or medicines” dur-
        ing the lookback period.
               The majority isolates a single word in the exclusion to deter-
        mine its entire scope: “for.” Majority Op. at 11–12. Even at a bird’s
        eye view, it is strange for the majority to base its entire textual anal-
        ysis on a single word that has, at least, eleven different definitions.
        See For, WEBSTER’S NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1959);
        For, OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (revised 2022). It is even
        stranger, as the majority does, to take one meaning of the word
        “for” as determinative and not even consider whether that mean-
        ing, or an alternative one, makes more sense in context. When con-
        sidering “possible meanings that a word . . . can bear,” a “judicial
        interpreter [should] consider the entire text, in view of its structure
        and of the physical and logical relation of its many parts.” ANTONIN
        SCALIA & BRYAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION
        OF LEGAL TEXTS § 24, at 167–68 (2012) (emphasis added). And

        “[p]articularly when interpreting” a text that “features as elastic a
        word” as for, we “construe [the text’s] language in its context and
        in light of the terms surrounding it.” Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9
        (2004).
               The majority attempts to make up for its interpretive myo-
        pia through name dropping by relying heavily on a sister circuit
        precedent involving a current Supreme Court Justice’s earlier in-
        terpretation of the word “for” in a materially different policy.
        Then-Judge Alito’s (whom the majority references three times by
        name) opinion in Lawson ex rel. Lawson v. Fortis Insurance Co. read
        “for” as a term that “connotes intent.” 301 F.3d 159, 165 (3d Cir.
        2002). The majority reasons that because none of Johnson’s doctors
        “intended or even thought” to treat scleroderma by name, they
        could not have treated Johnson “for” scleroderma during the look-
        back period. Majority Op. at 11.
               But this appeal is not so easy. The Reliance exclusion, read
        in context, cannot bear the intent-based meaning of “for” on which
        the majority rests its decision. Instead, “for” is read more naturally
        in the exclusion as meaning “because of.” See For, WEBSTER’S
        SECOND, supra (number seven); For, WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW
        INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (1993) (number eight); For, THE
        AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (5th
        ed. 2022) (number seven); For, OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY, supra
        (number seven). To be sure, “for” can be read as meaning “in-
        tended” in some parts of the exclusion. To take the majority’s ex-
        ample, it makes sense to say a sickness that doctors intended to

        treat during the lookback period is a pre-existing condition. See Ma-
        jority Op. at 12. Yet, in the context of other parts of the exclusion,
        it makes little sense to read “for” as having an “implicit intent re-
        quirement.” Lawson, 301 F.3d at 165.
                For example, under the majority’s view, a “diagnostic pro-
        cedure” must have been intended for a particular condition for the
        diagnostic procedure to trigger the exclusion. But a doctor does not
        perform a diagnostic procedure if he already knows what the diag-
        nosis is. And in some cases, contrary to the majority, a diagnostic
        procedure may point a doctor to a condition he never “suspected”
        or “even thought” of before the procedure. See Majority Op. at 22;
        see also id. at 11.
                By its plain meaning, a procedure is “diagnostic” when it
        “serv[es] to distinguish, identify, or determine,” Diagnostic,
        WEBSTER’S THIRD, or to “[i]ndicat[e] the nature of a disease,” Diag-
        nostic, WEBSTER’S SECOND. Nothing in that definition suggests that
        a diagnostic procedure ceases being “diagnostic” if it “identif[ies]”
        or “indicat[es]” an unsuspected condition. On the contrary, doctors
        learn to expect unsuspected findings. As one medical textbook ex-
        plains, “[i]n many cases, diagnostic testing can identify a condition
        before it is clinically apparent”—much less, one “clinically appar-
        ent” by its symptoms but unsuspected by name until the proce-
        dure. ERIN P. BALOGH ET AL., IMPROVING DIAGNOSIS IN HEALTH
        CARE 39 (2015). We recognized this common-sense medical reality
        in an unpublished decision when we said “[a]lthough doctors as-
        sign a ‘diagnostic conclusion’ to a known condition, they order

        ‘diagnostic procedure’ for unknown ones.” Jones v. Golden Rule Ins.
        Co., 748 Fed. App’x 861, 867 (11th Cir. Aug. 23, 2018).
               For example, imagine a doctor performs a CT scan thinking
        that his patient’s severe headaches are symptoms of a concussion
        sustained during a football game. See Concussion, MAYO CLINIC,
        https://perma.cc/8LTG-2P5H (noting that a “[CT] scan of the
        head is the standard test in adults to assess the brain right after in-
        jury”). During the CT scan, the doctor detects a cancerous tumor
        he determines to be the cause of the headaches. See Brain tumor,
        MAYO CLINIC, https://perma.cc/W7EB-VJW2 (noting that a “CT
        scan [may] show[] a brain tumor”). Although the doctor did not
        intend to diagnose or suspect brain cancer, he performed the brain
        scan “because of” it. After all, the tumor was the cause of the head-
        aches.
                That Lawson’s definition of “for” cannot be superimposed on
        Johnson’s policy should be no surprise. The policy in Lawson did
        not reference “diagnostic procedures,” see 301 F.3d at 161, and if it
        had, the Third Circuit might have adopted a different interpreta-
        tion, cf. LoCoco v. Med. Savs. Ins. Co., 530 F.3d 442, 446–47 (6th Cir.
        2008) (holding that Lawson’s intent-based definition of “for” did not
        “extend to the particular contractual language at issue,” because
        the language in the provision excluded sicknesses “for which . . .
        diagnosis . . . was recommended”).
              Reading “for” as “because of” avoids this interpretive prob-
        lem. A doctor can perform diagnostic procedures “because of” the
        underlying symptoms of scleroderma, even if he does not know or
USCA11 Case: 23-13443     Document: 36-1      Date Filed: 11/21/2025     Page: 30 of 36

        even suspect that the patient’s symptoms are attributable to sclero-
        derma. Indeed, it happened here. Johnson underwent a “diagnostic
        procedure”—an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy—because of gas-
        trointestinal symptoms that are also symptoms of scleroderma.
        This reading comports with the rest of the pre-existing condition
        exclusion. Under this definition, the policy excludes coverage for
        any sickness or injury “[because of] which [Johnson] received med-
        ical Treatment, consultation, care or services, including diagnostic
        procedures, or took prescribed drugs or medicines” during the
        lookback period.
                Inconveniently for the majority, our Court interpreted the
        same provision of the same policy in Ferrizzi v. Reliance Standard
        Life Insurance Company—yes, that Reliance Standard Life Insurance
        Company—and came to the opposite conclusion as the majority in
        a routine unpublished opinion several years ago. 792 F. App’x 678,
        680 (11th Cir. Nov. 7, 2019). As the majority admits, Ferrizzi held
        that the “Reliance policy exclusion does not require a formal diag-
        nosis during the lookback period” for the exclusion to apply. Id. at
        685. Contrary to the majority’s gloss, see Majority Op. at 20, neither
        did Ferrizzi require that the excludable sickness be “suspected” by
        healthcare professionals during the lookback period. After all, the
        text of the exclusion never requires that doctors “suspect” a partic-
        ular sickness for it to be excludable. The Ferrizzi court instead af-
        firmed Reliance’s denial of benefits by determining that the in-
        sured’s condition pre-existed the policy as a matter of fact and that
        he “received medical treatment” for a symptom of that condition.
        Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet, our interpretation of
USCA11 Case: 23-13443      Document: 36-1      Date Filed: 11/21/2025     Page: 31 of 36

        the same exclusion was, under the majority’s position, “arbitrary
        and capricious” and “unreasonable—full stop.” Majority Op. at 15,
        18. But as the district court reasoned, “[a]t a minimum,” Reliance’s
        adoption of the interpretation in Ferrizzi “demonstrate[s] that [Re-
        liance’s determination] was not unreasonable.”
                Instead of engaging seriously with the whole text of the ex-
        clusion, the majority ascribes to Reliance a position that it never
        takes—attacking a strawman. According to the majority, Reliance
        argues that “no beneﬁts are due if Johnson was treated for any
        symptoms during the lookback period that were not inconsistent
        with scleroderma.” Majority Op. at 3. This assertion does not ap-
        pear in Reliance’s brief nor was it uttered by Reliance’s counsel at
        oral argument (even if he inartfully answered a broad hypothet-
        ical). The majority took this argument from a quotation in the
        Third Circuit’s decision in McLeod v. Hartford Life and Accident Insur-
        ance Co., imputed it to Reliance, and rejected it as the Third Circuit
        did. See id. at 15 (quoting 372 F.3d 618, 625 (3d Cir. 2004)).
               But Reliance’s argument is not so broad. In its brief, Reliance
        instead argues that healthcare professionals treated Johnson’s scle-
        roderma during the lookback period because the “record[] indis-
        putably establish[es] that she received treatment, consultation[,]
        and medication during the look back period for the very conditions
        and symptoms” that prove that she suﬀers from scleroderma. To
        establish that, it points out that doctors treated and prescribed med-
        ication for the “various symptoms and conditions of scleroderma”
        she experienced during the lookback period. In other words,
USCA11 Case: 23-13443      Document: 36-1      Date Filed: 11/21/2025      Page: 32 of 36

        Reliance asserts there is more than “consistency” between what
        Johnson was treated for and scleroderma; they are the same thing.
        To borrow the majority’s metaphor, see Majority Opinion at 17 n.6,
        it is like using an umbrella to stay dry without knowing whether
        the current rainstorm is a hurricane or quick summer shower. In
        either case, the umbrella fends oﬀ the rains. So too doctors treated
        Johnson’s symptoms of scleroderma without knowing sclero-
        derma was their cause.
               It is hardly novel that the terms of a pre-existing condition
        exclusion may bar coverage for a sickness that went undiagnosed
        or unsuspected by name during the lookback period. See, e.g.,
        Hughes v. Bos. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 26 F.3d 264, 266, 269 (1st Cir. 1994)
        (concluding that a similar provision could be “reasonabl[y] inter-
        pret[ed]” to mean that a “treatment ‘for’ a condition refers to treat-
        ment of any symptom which in hindsight appears to be a manifes-
        tation of the condition”); LoCoco, 530 F.3d at 447 (“[I]f receipt of a
        recommendation to undergo a diagnostic process is suﬃcient to
        render a condition ‘pre-existing,’ as the language of the contract in
        this case states, it cannot be that an actual diagnostic conclusion is
        required.” (footnote omitted)); Bullwinkel v. New England Mut. Life
        Ins. Co., 18 F.3d 429, 430–32 (7th Cir. 1994) (excluding cancer as a
        pre-existing condition because “even though [the insured] did not
        know [her symptom] was cancerous . . . , her visit with the doctor”
        during the lookback period “concerning [the symptom] actually
        concerned cancer”); Marshall v. UNUM Life Ins. Co., 13 F.3d 282, 285

        [the insured] did not know the medical explanation for her condi-

        267 Cal. Rptr. 487, 492 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990) (concluding that pre-
        existing conditions were excludable if they were “manifest” during
        a lookback period and deﬁning manifest as “that point in time
        when the sickness or disease becomes symptomatic and not neces-
        sarily when the exact nature of sickness or disease is diagnosed by
        a physician” (alterations adopted) (citation and internal quotation

        1192 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990) (“That the doctor may have incor-
        rectly diagnosed the ‘sickness’ does not change the fact that the
        condition for which she received treatment was a preexisting con-

        ers Mut. Acc. Ass’n of Am., 181 N.E.2d 594, 596 (Mass. 1962) (holding
        that for the exclusion to apply, “[k]nowledge of the existence of the
        disease on the part of the plaintiﬀ was not required; it was suﬃcient
        if the disease had in fact originated prior to the eﬀective date of the
        policy”). Although these decisions do not bear on our interpreta-
        tion of the policy in this appeal, they conﬁrm that pre-existing con-
        ditions exclusions do not ordinarily turn on whether the condition
        was diagnosed or suspected during the lookback period.
              Because the majority’s reading of the policy is so narrow, it
        never engages with the record evidence Reliance reviewed in

        denying Johnson’s claim. But that evidence establishes that Reli-
        ance had reasonable grounds to conclude scleroderma was a pre-
        existing condition. In his statement to Reliance, Johnson’s own
        rheumatologist, Dr. Querubin, confirmed that Johnson first expe-
        rienced symptoms of scleroderma in October 2015 and that he
        treated her for those symptoms “every 1–3” months during the
        lookback period. In the light of our deferential review, that admis-
        sion alone is sufficient to establish that scleroderma was a “Sickness
        . . . for which [Johnson] received medical Treatment” during the
        lookback period. And there is nothing in the text of the policy that
        barred Reliance from so concluding because Dr. Querubin did not
        diagnose or suspect scleroderma during the lookback period.
               Other healthcare professionals also consulted with Johnson
        about symptoms she acknowledges are symptoms of scleroderma.
        Nurse Practitioner Ashleigh Clark treated Johnson for fatigue and
        joint swelling. Johnson consulted Dr. Alan Maloon at Premier Neu-
        rosurgical Institute for fatigue, nausea, and swelling of the feet and
        hands. As already explained, Johnson even underwent a “diagnos-
        tic procedure,” an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, for gastroin-
        testinal complaints. “Taken as a whole,” those medical records
        “provide sufficient evidence to conclude that” Johnson suffered
        from scleroderma, which “equated to a ‘Sickness or Injury’ under
        the Reliance policy during the lookback period.” Ferrizzi, 792 F.
        App’x at 686.
              An exclusion for a pre-existing condition “serves the . . . pur-
        pose of protecting insurers from fraudulent applicants seeking

        coverage for known diseases.” Mogil, 267 Cal. Rptr. at 491 (citation
        and internal quotation marks omitted). When insurance compa-
        nies began using these exclusions, “they failed to expressly define
        the term” pre-existing condition in their policies. Id. So, courts in-
        terpreting the exclusions “adopt[ed] [a] general rule” to define
        them. Id. The majority of courts settled on the rule that a pre-exist-
        ing condition exists when it becomes “manifest or active or when
        there is a distinct symptom or condition from which one learned in
        medicine can with reasonable accuracy diagnose the illness.” Id.
        (emphasis added) (collecting cases); see also Preferred Risk Life Ins.
        Co. v. Sande, 421 So. 2d 566, 568 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982) (defining
        “manifest” as “when the sickness or disease becomes symptomatic
        and not necessarily when the exact nature of sickness or disease is
        diagnosed by a physician after extensive testing” (citation and in-
        ternal quotation marks omitted)). It made sense not to base the ex-
        cludability of a pre-existing condition on whether a doctor had yet
        diagnosed or suspected it by name during the lookback period.
        Otherwise, “unscrupulous applicants . . . fraudulently attempt[ing]
        to gain coverage” after experiencing serious symptoms could first
        obtain coverage and only later seek medical evaluation. Mogil, 267
        Cal. Rptr. at 491 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A
        sickly yet undiagnosed applicant with symptoms XYZ is in the same
        position of a sickly, diagnosed applicant with the same symptoms. It
        would defy the purpose of the exclusion to give the former, but not
        the latter, benefits and to provide an ill person an incentive to ob-
        tain coverage before being medically evaluated.

                I accept that Johnson, in good faith, diligently sought to dis-
        cover the cause of her symptoms, but the record makes plain that
        she displayed sufficient “symptom[s] or condition[s] from which
        one learned in medicine c[ould] with reasonable accuracy diagnose
        the illness.” Id. Her lookback-period symptoms were the same as
        the symptoms her physician later stated were attributable to scle-
        roderma—joint pain and swelling, shortness of breath, persistent
        cough, digestive and gastrointestinal problems, and fatigue. That
        her doctors were temporarily unable to diagnose the cause of those
        symptoms as scleroderma does not change the fact that Johnson
        experienced and received treatment and diagnostic procedures for
        them well before she obtained insurance and now seeks benefits
        because of their disabling effect.
                                    *     *      *
               Ms. Johnson’s condition is unfortunate, but the terms of her
        policy plainly contemplate that a condition need not be diagnosed
        or even suspected to be pre-existing. Because it was neither arbi-
        trary nor capricious for Reliance to conclude that scleroderma was
        a pre-existing condition under the terms of the policy exclusion, I
        would affirm.
               I respectfully dissent.
