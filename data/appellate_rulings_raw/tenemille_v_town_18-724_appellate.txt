      Appeal from a judgment and order of the United States District Court for

the Southern District of New York (Kenneth M. Karas, Judge).


      UPON      DUE     CONSIDERATION,          IT   IS   HEREBY      ORDERED,

ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment and June 7, 2022 order of the

district court are AFFIRMED.

      Ernst Theodore Tenemille, pro se, appeals from the district court’s dismissal

of his employment discrimination action and the denial of his Federal Rule of Civil

                                        2
Procedure 60(b) motion for reconsideration. Tenemille commenced this action

against the Town of Ramapo (the “Town”), the Town of Ramapo Police

Department (the “Department”) (his former employer), and Town and

Department officials, alleging discrimination, harassment, and retaliation,

culminating in his December 2016 termination, allegedly in violation of Title VII,

42 U.S.C. § 1983, and several state law provisions.

      Tenemille’s pro se fourth amended complaint alleged that he was employed

by the Department as a police officer from August 2002 until December 2016. In

November 2015, Tenemille was investigated by the Police Department for

submitting allegedly improper sick notes for absences due to a minor injury,

culminating in his termination on December 16, 2016. Tenemille alleged that the

investigation and his termination were due to discrimination based on his national

origin and/or his race, and as retaliation for his protected activity of questioning

the Defendants’ access of his private medical information.

      The defendants moved, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), to

dismiss the fourth amended complaint as time-barred and for failure to state a

claim. In January 2022, the district court granted the defendants’ motion to

dismiss, reasoning that some of Tenemille’s allegations were time-barred, and that

                                         3
his timely allegations failed to state a claim. The court granted Tenemille 30 days

to file a fifth amended complaint.

      In lieu of amending, Tenemille moved for reconsideration. The district court

construed the motion under Rule 60(b) and denied it, concluding that relief was

not warranted. Tenemille timely appealed the district court’s judgment and the

denial of his motion for reconsideration.

      We assume the parties’ familiarity with the remaining facts, the procedural

history, and the issues on appeal.

      I.     Dismissal of the Fourth Amended Complaint

      “We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo.” Sharikov v. Philips

Med. Sys. MR, Inc., 103 F.4th 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2024). “A complaint survives a Rule

12(b)(6) motion to dismiss if the facts, taken as true and with all reasonable

inferences drawn in the plaintiff’s favor, state a plausible claim to relief.” Id.

“While we are required to assume the truth of the ‘well-pleaded factual

allegations’ in the complaint, that obligation is ‘inapplicable to legal conclusions,’

such as ‘[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action’ that are

‘supported by mere conclusory statements.’” Id. (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.

662, 678–79 (2009)).

                                            4
      “[T]o properly assert a claim of discrimination against an employer under

Title VII, a plaintiff must allege two elements: (1) the employer discriminated

against [him] (2) because of [his] race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Buon

v. Spindler, 65 F.4th 64, 78 (2d Cir. 2023) (internal quotation marks and citation

omitted). “To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a

right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show

that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state

law.” Id. (citation omitted). “A state employee acting in his official capacity is

acting under color of state law,” and “[o]nce the color of law requirement is met,

a plaintiff’s equal protection claim parallels his Title VII claim, except that a § 1983

claim, unlike a Title VII claim, can be brought against an individual.” Id. (citations

omitted).

      “[F]or a discrimination claim to survive a motion to dismiss, absent direct

evidence of discrimination, what must be plausibly supported by facts alleged in

the complaint is that the plaintiff (1) is a member of a protected class, (2) was

qualified, (3) suffered an adverse employment action, and (4) has at least minimal

support for the proposition that the employer was motivated by discriminatory

intent.” Id. (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).

                                           5
      We agree with the district court that Tenemille’s allegations related to his

doctors’ notes failed to plausibly allege discriminatory intent, as necessary to

survive a motion to dismiss.

      To establish an inference of discrimination through the use of comparators,

Tenemille was required to show “a reasonably close resemblance of the facts and

circumstances of [his] and [his] comparator’s cases.” Radwan v. Manuel, 55 F.4th

101, 132 (2d Cir. 2022) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here,

Tenemille asserted that there were numerous “similarly situated” white officers

who “turned in doctor’s notes identical to Plaintiff’s without legal challenge or

investigation based on wording.” App’x 7 (Compl. ¶ 35). However, Tenemille

failed to allege any further detail about these purportedly “identical” doctors’

notes or about the other officers that would suffice to show that he was “similarly

situated” to these other officers “in all material respects.” Radwan, 55 F.4th at 132.

Tenemille’s conclusory assertion was not enough to “nudg[e] [his] claims across

the line from conceivable to plausible.” See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,

570 (2007).




                                          6
       II.      Denial of the Motion for Reconsideration

       “A denial of a motion to vacate a judgment under Rule 60(b) is reviewed for

abuse of discretion.” Mandala v. NTT Data, Inc., 88 F.4th 353, 359 (2d Cir. 2023)

(citation omitted). “Under this standard, we must affirm the denial of vacatur,

unless the ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous

assessment of the evidence.” Id. (alteration and citation omitted).

       The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Tenemille’s Rule

60(b) motion.       On appeal, Tenemille primarily argues that his motion for

reconsideration alleged fraud warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(3). “To prevail

on a Rule 60(b)(3) motion, a movant must show that the conduct complained of

prevented the moving party from fully and fairly presenting his case.” State St.

Bank & Trust Co. v. Inversiones Errazuriz Limitada, 374 F.3d 158, 176 (2d Cir. 2004)

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, Tenemille’s allegations of

fraud related solely to the alleged events underlying his fourth amended

complaint. Because Tenemille did not show that the defendants prevented him

from fully and fairly presenting his case, and instead merely reiterated his

previous allegations, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Rule

60(b) relief.

                                         7
       We have considered Tenemille’s remaining arguments and conclude they

are without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment and June 7, 2022 order

of the district court.

                                   FOR THE COURT:
