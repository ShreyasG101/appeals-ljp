                        January 13, 2025
           GELPÍ, Circuit Judge.      Justin and Jared Brackett own and

operate two restaurants in the Town of Harwich, Massachusetts

("Harwich"): Ember Pizza, Inc. ("Ember") and The Port Restaurant

and Bar, Inc. ("The Port") (collectively, "Plaintiffs-Appellants"

or "Ember and The Port").          Ember and The Port held liquor and

entertainment licenses issued by Harwich.                But they allegedly

committed a series of violations of Harwich's noise ordinance and

Massachusetts COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in suspensions of

and   restrictions    on   their    permits.      In     response    to   these

suspensions, Ember and The Port sued Harwich, multiple Harwich

officials, and other individuals in federal district court.                  In

their amended complaint (hereinafter, the "complaint"), Ember and

The Port asserted various federal and state claims. The defendants

filed   several   dispositive      motions,    which    the   district    court

largely granted.     When all was said and done, Ember and The Port's

claims had all been rejected, and having found that an amendment

would be futile, the district court denied Ember and The Port's

request for leave to amend their complaint.            This appeal followed.

We affirm.

                             I. BACKGROUND

           Because    this   appeal    follows     the    district    court's

judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and (c),

we accept as true the well-pleaded allegations from Ember and The

Port's complaint.    Legal Sea Foods, LLC v. Strathmore Ins. Co., 36

F.4th 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2022) (quoting Alston v. Spiegel, 988 F.3d

564, 571 (1st Cir. 2021)).

                            A. Factual Background

            Ember and The Port are restaurants located in Harwich;

both restaurants are owned by Jared and Justin Brackett.                      The

Harwich Board of Selectmen (the "Board") granted liquor licenses

to the restaurants annually, or seasonally.             The Board also issued

Ember and The Port entertainment licenses, which permitted the

restaurants    to    play    amplified   or    acoustic    music   indoors    and

outdoors.

            Even with the entertainment licenses, however, Ember and

The Port still had to comply with the Harwich Noise Ordinance (the

"Ordinance").       The Ordinance regulates sound and noise volume in

the Town.      It provides, in relevant part, that "[i]t shall be

unlawful for any person or persons to cause or allow any noise

which   emanates     from    any   building,    boat,     structure,     vehicle,

premises, or any sound amplification system, which is plainly

audible at a distance of 150 feet from any such building, boat,

structure, vehicle, premises or sound amplification system."                  The

Ordinance      further      provides     that     plainly       audible     noise

"constitute[s] prima facie evidence of a violation," defining

"plainly audible" as "[a]ny sound from a source regulated by this

bylaw   that   can    be    detected   above    routine    or   normal    ambient

background noise by unaided human hearing."


                                       - 4 -
             In September 2019, Harwich found that multiple noise

complaints made against Ember showed a violation of the Ordinance.

The next month, the Board voted to suspend Ember's entertainment

license in its entirety for two days and to restrict the license

to acoustic-only performances for five days.

             However, due to the pandemic, Ember did not serve at

least some of this suspension.         In the intervening period, it was

also accused of some "additional violations" of the Ordinance.

Thus, on August 3, 2020, the Board voted to rescind its prior

suspensions and, instead, impose a seven-day suspension of Ember's

entertainment license.        Ember and The Port allege that false noise

complaints were lodged against them, and that Harwich selectively

enforced the Ordinance.         Ember and The Port further assert that

other licensees -- including competitor restaurants -- engaged in

"open and obvious violations," without experiencing disciplinary

action from Harwich.

             Along with their alleged Ordinance violations, Ember and

The   Port   were   charged    with    violating    Massachusetts   COVID-19

restrictions.        Massachusetts'      2020,     pandemic-era   guidelines

allowed restaurants to remain open only for takeout food and

alcohol sales.      On May 28, 2020, the Harwich Police Deputy Chief

referred to Harwich several alleged violations of the COVID-19

guidance by The Port and Ember.          As with the Ordinance, Ember and




                                      - 5 -
The Port allege that the COVID-19 restrictions were selectively

enforced against them.

          In November 2020, Ember and The Port applied to the Board

for renewal of their entertainment license.      Having approved other

restaurants'   entertainment   licenses   months   prior,   the   Board

eventually renewed Ember's liquor and entertainment licenses on

April 26, 2021, but imposed an acoustic-only restriction on the

entertainment license.      The day after the renewal of Ember's

licenses, the Board revoked The Port's expanded outdoor dining

permit.   Moreover, a few weeks later, on May 10, 2021, the Board

re-imposed the acoustic-only restriction on The Port.         And the

Board did not renew The Port's liquor license until May 12, 2021,

when it also suspended that license for three days as discipline

for the COVID-19 violations.

          Ember and The Port filed multiple lawsuits in state court

along with an appeal to Massachusetts' Alcoholic Beverages Control

Commission.

                         B. Procedural History

          On March 19, 2021, Ember and The Port sued several

defendants in the District of Massachusetts.        Two months later,

they filed an amended complaint (the "complaint"), which forms the

basis for the present dispute.    The complaint named as defendants:

Harwich; Board members Larry G. Ballantine ("Ballantine"), Donald

F. Howell ("Howell"), Michael D. MacAskill ("MacAskill"), Edward


                                 - 6 -
J. McManus ("McManus"), and Stephen P. Ford ("Ford") in their

individual    capacities;    and   two     individuals,    Gail    O.    Sluis

("Sluis") and Patricia A. O'Neill ("O'Neill").              The defendants

also included a host of other Harwich officials, sued in their

individual capacities.1

          Ember and The Port's complaint alleged six counts: Count

one alleged that the defendants, in their official capacities,

conspired to deprive Ember and The Port of their constitutional

rights.      42   U.S.C.   §§ 1983,   1985.      Count    two   invoked    the

Massachusetts Civil Rights Act ("MCRA"), alleging -- against the

defendants    individually -- denial        of   due     process   "by     the

application of vague and unclear standards."           Counts three through

six alleged various violations of common law and Massachusetts

state law.

          On September 29 and 30, 2021, the Harwich defendants and

Sluis moved to dismiss; those motions were granted on January 28,



     1 The complaint also named as defendants "John and/or Jane
Does 1–10" -- unidentified individuals who allegedly conspired
with the named defendants to harm the plaintiffs. The district
court dismissed the claims against the Does, holding that the
complaint   did   not   offer   information   on   "a   good-faith
investigation . . . to reveal the identit[ies] of the" Does.

*10 n.12 (D. Mass. Jan. 28, 2022) (quoting Rodríguez-Reyes v.
Molina-Rodríguez, 711 F.3d 49, 57 n.6 (1st Cir. 2013)). Neither
party references, nor offers any argument as to, those individuals
on appeal. Any claim against those individuals is, thus, waived.
See   Rodríguez-Reyes,   711   F.3d    at   57-58   n.6   (quoting

                                   - 7 -
2022.   On March 28, 2022, Harwich and Sluis filed a motion for

separate and final judgment and on March 31, 2022, O'Neill filed

her   notice   of   intent   to   file   a    motion   for   judgment   on   the

pleadings.     On April 11, 2022, Ember and The Port cross-moved for

relief from the district court's order granting the motions to

dismiss and for leave to file another amended complaint.                     On

April 15, 2022, O'Neill filed her motion for judgment on the

pleadings, and, in response, Ember and The Port cross-moved for

leave to file an amended complaint.           On July 22, 2022, the district

court denied the Harwich defendants and Sluis' motion for separate

and final judgment and denied Ember and The Port's cross-motion

for relief and for leave to amend.           On March 15, 2023, the district

court granted O'Neill's motion for judgment on the pleadings,

denied Ember and The Port's second cross-motion for leave to amend

as futile, and rejected the complaint.            Ember and The Port timely

appealed the district court's decisions rejecting their claims and

denying their second cross-motion for leave to amend.

                              II. DISCUSSION

           Ember and The Port's arguments largely fall in two

buckets.     First, they contend that the district court erred in

determining that the complaint failed to state a claim that is

plausible on its face.       Second, Ember and The Port argue that the

district court erred in denying their request for leave to amend

as futile.     We analyze each argument in turn, concluding that the


                                    - 8 -
district court correctly rejected Ember and The Port's claims as

well as correctly denied leave to amend.2

                          A. Legal Standards

          We "review the grant of a motion to dismiss de novo,

accepting well-pled facts as true and drawing all inferences in

favor of the non-moving party."       Rivera-Rosario v. LSREF2 Island

Holdings, Ltd., 79 F.4th 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2023) (quoting Triangle

Cayman Asset Co. v. LG & AC, Corp., 52 F.4th 24, 32 (1st Cir.

2022)).    "The   sole   inquiry   under   Rule   12(b)(6)   is   whether,

construing the well-pleaded facts of the complaint in the light

most favorable to the plaintiffs, the complaint states a claim for

which relief can be granted."      Ocasio-Hernández v. Fortuño-Burset,

640 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)).

Moreover, "we may affirm the dismissal of a complaint on any basis

available in the record."    Sakab Saudi Holding Co. v. Aljabri, 58

F.4th 585, 594 (1st Cir. 2023) (internal quotation marks omitted)

(quoting Yan v. ReWalk Robotics Ltd., 973 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir.

2020)).   "The standard of review of a motion for judgment on the

pleadings under [Rule] 12(c) is the same as that for a motion to

rejection of the complaint and then their arguments on the denial
of their request for leave to amend the complaint.


                                   - 9 -
dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)."          Marrero-Gutierrez v. Molina, 491

F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007) (citations omitted).

            We follow a two-step approach in determining whether a

claim for which relief can be granted has been established. First,

we "isolate and ignore statements in the complaint that simply

offer   legal     labels     and     conclusions        or     merely      rehash

cause-of-action elements."         Schatz v. Republican State Leadership

Comm., 669 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing Ocasio-Hernández,

640 F.3d at 12).      Next, we "take the complaint's well-pled (i.e.,

non-conclusory,    non-speculative)       facts    as    true,     drawing    all

reasonable inferences in the pleader's favor, and see if they

plausibly   narrate    a   claim    for   relief."           Id.    This     is   a

"context-specific" approach that requires us "to draw on" our

"judicial experience and common sense."            Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556

U.S. 662, 679 (2009).

            How we review an appeal from a trial court's entry of

judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is nearly identical to

our Rule 12(b)(6) review.      We consider the decision de novo and

ask "if the non-movant's factual allegations raise a right to

relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the

allegations in the complaint are true."                 Est. of Bennett v.

Wainwright, 548 F.3d 155, 163 (1st Cir. 2008) (internal quotation

marks and citation omitted).        The "modest difference" between the

two is that a Rule 12(c) motion "implicates the pleadings as a


                                    - 10 -
whole."    Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st

Cir. 2006) (citing 5C Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,

Federal Practice and Procedure § 1368 (3d ed. 2004)).

            B. Constitutional Claims Under Section 1983

           "Section 1983 supplies a private right of action against

a person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights

secured by the Constitution or by federal law." Santiago v. Puerto

Rico, 655 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Redondo–Borges v.

U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 421 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005)).

Plaintiffs must allege two "essential elements" for a § 1983 cause

of action: "(i) that the conduct complained of has been committed

under color of state law, and (ii) that this conduct worked a

denial of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United

States."   Finamore v. Miglionico, 15 F.4th 52, 58 (1st Cir. 2021)

(quoting Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals of Andover, 811 F.2d 36, 40

(1st Cir. 1987)).

           Ember and The Port bring their § 1983 claims against all

defendants,   including   the   individual   defendants -- Sluis   and

O'Neill. Sluis and O'Neill are, without question, private parties.

But the conduct of private parties can be "fairly attributable to

the State" in certain circumstances.     Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,

457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982); Estades-Negroni v. CPC Hosp. San Juan

Capestrano, 412 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005).         Where "challenged

conduct cannot be classified as state action, a section 1983 claim


                                - 11 -
necessarily fails."       Cruz-Arce v. Mgmt. Admin. Servs. Corp., 19

F.4th 538, 543 (1st Cir. 2021) (citing Santiago, 655 F.3d at 68).

We have used three tests to determine whether a private party can

be characterized as a state actor: "the public function test, the

joint action/nexus test, [and] the state compulsion test." Alberto

San, Inc. v. Consejo de Titulares del Condominio San Alberto, 522

F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Estades–Negroni, 412 F.3d at 5).

              On appeal, Ember and The Port appear to rely on the

public function test, arguing: "[t]he district court ignored that

it is also sufficient to allege O'Neill's and Sluis' intent to

influence state action, as their doing so seeks to supplant state

conduct with their own . . . ."3          The public function test asks

whether   a    private   entity   has   exercised   powers   "traditionally

exclusively reserved to the State."           Santiago, 655 F.3d at 69

(quoting Jackson v. Metro. Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 352 (1974)).

The activities that fall under the umbrella of public function are

"few and far between."      Id.


     3 Ember and The Port's inartful pleading makes it difficult
to discern whether they intend to rely on the public function test
or, alternatively, on the joint action test.      The Plaintiffs-
Appellants argued below that Sluis/O'Neill "conspired with state
actors to deprive Plaintiffs of their civil rights."      If their
intention was to make a joint action argument, it fails.       The
facts, as alleged in the complaint, are insufficient to show joint
action. See Glaros v. Perse, 628 F.2d 679, 685 (1st Cir. 1980)
("[G]eneral allegations of cooperation between private individuals
and unspecified government agencies do not . . . make out a claim
of action taken under color of state law." (citing Grow v. Fisher,
523 F.2d 875, 878-79 (7th Cir. 1975))).


                                   - 12 -
             Here, Ember and The Port failed to allege facts that

O'Neill and Sluis exercised powers traditionally reserved to the

State.    As to both Sluis and O'Neill, the complaint stated that

they "engaged in ex-parte communications" with Harwich.          Ember and

The   Port   further   contended    that    "internal,    non-public   Town

memoranda and information" were released to O'Neill and Sluis.

These alleged facts do not support a claim that Sluis and O'Neill

sought to supplant state power with their own.            The § 1983 claim

was therefore properly rejected as to Sluis and O'Neill.           We next

rehearse why this claim also fails as to the Harwich defendants.4

                          1. First Amendment

             Ember and The Port originally argued that the Ordinance

was both impermissibly broad and vague, thus abridging their

freedom of speech under the First Amendment.5            However, in their

reply brief, Ember and The Port abandon their facial and as applied

First Amendment allegations. As they put it, "Plaintiffs no longer

press their facial and as applied challenges to the Noise Bylaw."

They made a similar concession at oral argument.            We, therefore,



      4It is unclear whether Ember and The Port continue to press
their § 1985 claim. As they have not adequately briefed that claim
on appeal, we deem it waived. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d
1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) ("[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory
manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,
are deemed waived.").
      5The First Amendment, applied to the states through the
Fourteenth Amendment, provides that "Congress shall make no
law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." U.S. Const. amend. I.


                                   - 13 -
deem as waived the First Amendment facial and as-applied challenges

and need not further address them.              See United States v. Carter,

19 F.4th 520, 524 (1st Cir. 2021); United States v. Rodriguez, 311

F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) ("A party who identifies an issue,

and then explicitly withdraws it, has waived the issue.").

            Ember and The Port's only other argument under the First

Amendment is that a series of the Board's decisions were a form of

retaliation      on   account     of   their    "outspoken     and    very   public

complaints of selective enforcement by municipal officials."                      In

support   of   this        argument,   Ember    and   The   Port     point   to   the

acoustic-only music restriction and the delay in renewal of their

licenses.        More       specifically,      they   allege       that   appellees

"undertook a malicious and orchestrated campaign to selectively

target and retaliate against" them by "fabricating violations of

the noise ordinance and COVID-19 restrictions."                    In arguing that

the   district    court      improperly     "ignored"    their     allegations     of

retaliatory conduct, Ember and The Port cite both Cosenza v. City

of Worcester and Erickson v. Pardus.                  These cases dealt with

neither the First Amendment nor allegations of retaliation.                       See

generally Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89 (2007); Cosenza v. City

of Worcester, 355 F. Supp. 3d 81 (D. Mass. 2019).                  "Judges are not

mind-readers,         so     parties    must     spell      out     their    issues

clearly . . . analyzing on-point authority."                Rodríguez v. Mun. of

San Juan, 659 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).


                                       - 14 -
Ember and The Port's inadequate briefing on this claim "precludes

our review of its merits."       See Snyder v. Collura, 812 F.3d 46,

53-54 (1st Cir. 2016).

          Additionally, and as the defendants point out, there was

no retaliation claim in the complaint, "and such a claim was never

argued in any of the relevant hearings in the District Court."        In

fact, in response to the motion to dismiss, Ember and The Port did

not mention a First Amendment retaliation claim at all.        This is

not the first time we have seen an attempt at this type of

maneuver -- in   Snyder,   the   plaintiff   similarly   abandoned   his

claims of violations of equal protection and substantive due

process, opting instead to propose a claim of First Amendment

retaliation.   See id. at 50.    We held there, as we now hold here,

that claim waived.   See id. at 51; see also Johnston v. Holiday

Inns, Inc., 595 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir. 1979) ("It is by now

axiomatic that an issue not presented to the trial court cannot be

raised for the first time on appeal." (citations omitted)).          The

point at which Ember and The Port should have revealed their claim

of First Amendment retaliation has long passed.

                      2. Fourteenth Amendment

          Ember and The Port next allege violations of their

Fourteenth Amendment rights.        The Due Process Clause of the

Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall "deprive any

person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."


                                 - 15 -
U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Put differently, "certain substantive

rights -- life, liberty, and property -- cannot be deprived except

pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures."     Cleveland Bd.

of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985).      "In cases of

denial of a local license or permit, the standard for determining

whether government conduct constitutes either a substantive due

process or an equal protection violation 'is so similar as to

compress the inquiries into one.'"       Collins v. Nuzzo, 244 F.3d

246, 250 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting Baker v. Coxe, 230 F.3d 470, 474

(1st Cir. 2000)). We thus analyze Ember and The Port's substantive

due process and equal protection claims in conjunction here.

            3. Substantive Due Process and Equal Protection

            To adequately plead a substantive due process claim, a

plaintiff must allege "a deprivation of a protected interest in

life, liberty, or property."    See Rivera v. Rhode Island, 402 F.3d

27, 33–34 (1st Cir. 2005) (first citing R.I. Bhd. of Corr. Officers

v. Rhode Island, 357 F.3d 42, 49 (1st Cir. 2004); and then citing

Macone v. Town of Wakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002)).       A

complaint must also contain facts sufficient to show an "abuse of

government power that shocks the conscience" or "action that is

legally irrational in that it is not sufficiently keyed to any

legitimate state interests."     Collins, 244 F.3d at 250 (citation

omitted).     This standard is an unforgiving one, ensuring that

federal judges do not wade into territory "traditionally reserved


                                - 16 -
for state and local tribunals."           Id. at 251 (quoting Nestor Colón

Medina & Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st Cir.

1992)).

           The important inquiry in examining whether substantive

due   process    has   been    violated    is   whether   "some   basic   and

fundamental principle has been transgressed."             Amsden v. Moran,

904 F.2d 748, 754 (1st Cir. 1990) (citation omitted).             In short,

the "substantive due process doctrine may not, in the ordinary

course,   be    invoked   to   challenge     discretionary   permitting   or

licensing determinations of state or local decisionmakers, whether

those decisions are right or wrong."            Pagán v. Calderón, 448 F.3d

16, 33 (1st Cir. 2006) (citations omitted).

           Ember and The Port contend that Harwich violated their

due process rights by unlawfully delaying renewal of their liquor

and entertainment licenses.6       They argue that Harwich dragged them



      6In their reply brief, citing our decision in Nestor Colón,
Ember and The Port state:      "Where, as here, Plaintiffs have
plausibly stated a claim for violation of Plaintiffs' First
Amendment freedoms, Plaintiffs abandon their substantive due
process claim rather than enter into the 'uncharted thicket of
substantive due process.'"    It is, thus, unclear which of the
Plaintiffs-Appellants' claims they contend are still live.      As
Ember and The Port did not, in fact, plausibly state a claim for
violation of their First Amendment freedoms, we address their
substantive due process claim. See Caz v. Garland, 84 F.4th 22,
30 (1st Cir. 2023) (first citing Vaz Dos Reis v. Holder, 606 F.3d
1, 4 n.3 (1st Cir. 2010); and then citing Kheireddine v. Gonzales,
427 F.3d 80, 86 n.6 (1st Cir. 2005)) (ignoring a waiver of an
argument and considering the "argument's merits for the sake of
completeness").


                                   - 17 -
through "a series of untimely, costly, protracted, non-statutory

and unconstitutional public hearings."            During these hearings,

Ember and The Port's counsel was allegedly muted and unable to

"meaningfully cross-examine witnesses."

            Here, at the pleadings stage, Ember and The Port "must

point, with at least some minimal specificity, to the rudimentary

facts supporting" their claim. Nestor Colón, 964 F.2d at 39 (first

citing Goldman v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 607 F.2d 1014, 1019 (1st

Cir. 1979); and then citing Fisher v. Flynn, 598 F.2d 663, 665

(1st Cir. 1979)).    None of Ember and The Port's allegations come

close to reaching the level of "extreme and egregious" conduct

that we have held is necessary.        See DePoutot v. Raffaelly, 424

F.3d 112, 118 (1st Cir. 2005). In Collins, we held that a municipal

board did not abuse its government powers when it denied a license

to operate a used car lot.    244 F.3d at 248.       As with the licensure

denial in Collins, we note that the complaint here -- recounting

how Harwich sparred with Ember and The Port over how they operated

their businesses -- evidences a contentious relationship.            See id.

But, as in Collins, we will not label the Board's actions here

"legally    irrational"   solely    upon    a   showing   of   interpersonal

acrimony.    See id. at 251; see also Cordi-Allen v. Conlon, 494

F.3d 245, 255 (1st Cir. 2007) (affirming a grant of summary

judgment in favor of the Town even where "the record reflect[ed]

that the Town ha[d] not been particularly accommodating").            It was


                                   - 18 -
entirely legally rational for the Town to enforce its ordinances

and guidelines and to impose reasonable sanctions when those

ordinances were ignored.

            Ember and The Port insist that the district court "erred

when it limited its review [of] Plaintiffs' due process claims

solely to abuses of government power that 'shock[] the conscience'

when a due process violation also occurs when the government action

is not sufficiently keyed to any legitimate state interest."                  In

making this argument, Ember and The Port misread our case law.                In

actuality,      "conscience-shocking      conduct     is   an    indispensable

element    of   a   substantive   due    process    challenge    to    executive

action."    DePoutot, 424 F.3d at 118 n.4 (citations omitted).

            The     district   court     thus   correctly       held   that   no

substantive due process violation existed.             For similar reasons,

see Collins, 244 F.3d at 250, Ember and The Port's equal protection

argument fails.

                        4. Procedural Due Process

            Ember and The Port contend that Harwich violated their

procedural due process rights by unlawfully delaying renewal of

their liquor and entertainment licenses.            On appeal, all parties'

briefing on this issue is, well, brief.            We follow their lead.

            "Where        state         procedures -- though            arguably

imperfect -- provide a suitable form of predeprivation hearing

coupled with the availability of meaningful judicial review, the


                                   - 19 -
fourteenth amendment guarantee of procedural due process is not

embarrassed."     Chongris, 811 F.2d at 40 (citing Creative Env'ts,

Inc. v. Estabrook, 680 F.2d 822, 829–30 (1st Cir. 1982)).               As also

relevant here, the Parratt-Hudson doctrine -- as developed in part

in Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 (1981) -- provides:                 "When a

deprivation of a property interest is occasioned by random and

unauthorized conduct by state officials, . . . the due process

inquiry   is    limited     to   the    issue    of   the   adequacy   of   the

postdeprivation remedies provided by the state."                   Hadfield v.

McDonough, 407 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting O'Neill v.

Baker, 210 F.3d 41, 42 (1st Cir. 2000)).

          Here, Ember and The Port insist that the Board did not

follow the procedures as required by law.             In their briefing, they

argue that "unlawful procedures by the Board occurred on April 27,

2021, . . . without       following       the   procedures     prescribed    in

Governor Baker's Executive Orders Nos. 37 and 50."                 They further

assert that their right to "procedural due process under" Mass.

Cen. Laws ch. 138 was deprived and that chapter 138 "requires

fundamentally lawful and unbiased procedures."              Their claims focus

on the unauthorized acts of the Board, rather than some alleged

deficiency     with   the    state      laws    and   proscribed     procedures

themselves. See id. at 20 ("[C]onduct is 'random and unauthorized'

within the meaning of Parratt-Hudson when the challenged state




                                       - 20 -
action is a flaw in the official's conduct rather than a flaw in

the state law itself." (citation omitted)).

            We assume, without deciding, that the Board did engage

in unauthorized acts.         Thus, the only question is whether Ember

and   The   Port   had   an    adequate   postdeprivation   remedy    under

Massachusetts law.       See id. at 21.      Indeed, they did.       As the

district court acknowledged, Ember and The Port had access to, and

utilized, adequate postdeprivation processes under Mass. Gen. Laws

ch. 249, § 4, having filed multiple lawsuits in state court. Ember

and The Port also availed themselves of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 138,

§ 67 when they filed their appeal with the Alcoholic Beverages

Control Commission.7




      7Ember and The Port also briefly mention a "facial taking"
under the Fifth Amendment. "It is not enough merely to mention a
possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to
do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put
flesh on its bones." Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17. As this argument
was neither briefed nor argued below in any depth, it is waived.
See id. (noting the "settled appellate rule that issues adverted
to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at
developed argumentation, are deemed waived").


                                   - 21 -
                C. State Law and Common Law Claims

          We turn finally to Ember and The Port's state law claims.

Ember and The Port bring both MCRA claims and state constitutional

claims.

                                1. MCRA Claim

          Ember and The Port claim that the defendants conspired

to deny them their rights under the Massachusetts Civil Rights

Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, §§ 11H and 11I ("MCRA"), and Articles

12 and 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.                  The MCRA

provides a cause of action for a party "whose rights under the

Constitution, federal law, or state law have been interfered with

by threats, intimidation, or coercion of another."                Kelley v.

LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing the MCRA).                   The

MCRA is co-extensive with § 1983 except on two points.             The MCRA:

(1) "does not require any state action" and (2) "requires a

violation by threats, intimidation, or coercion."                 Id. (first

citing Duca v. Martins, 941 F.Supp. 1281, 1294 (D. Mass. 1996);

and then citing Duarte v. Healy, 537 N.E.2d 1230, 1232 (Mass.

1989)).

          The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has provided

that to establish a claim under the MCRA, a plaintiff "must prove

that (1) his exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the

Constitution   or   laws   of   either   the    United   States   or    of   the

Commonwealth (2) has been interfered with, or attempted to be


                                   - 22 -
interfered      with,    and   (3)    that    the   interference       or    attempted

interference was by 'threats, intimidation or coercion.'"                        Bally

v. Ne. Univ., 532 N.E.2d 49, 51-52 (Mass. 1989) (quoting Mass.

Gen. Laws ch. 12, § 11H).             "Whether conduct amounts to threats,

intimidation,      or    coercion      is     assessed    under    an       objective,

'reasonable person' standard."                Salmon v. Lang, 57 F.4th 296,

316-17 (1st Cir. 2022) (citing Planned Parenthood League of Mass.,

Inc. v. Blake, 631 N.E.2d 985, 990-91 (Mass. 1994)).                        Under that

standard, non-physical acts rarely support a basis for recovery.

Id. at 317 (citing Thomas v. Harrington, 909 F.3d 483, 492-93 (1st

Cir. 2018)).

           We need not spill much ink on this issue.                   The complaint

does not allege that Ember and The Port felt compelled or deterred

due to any conduct by the defendants.               Rather, Ember and The Port

aver the occurrence of only a few "veiled threats."                    These threats

allegedly included former Harwich Board Chair MacAskill stating

"kiss the ring" and "good luck."               But, "[a]s we have repeatedly

stated,   the    exception      for    MCRA    claims    based    on    non-physical

coercion remains a narrow one, and it should not be invoked unless

the record resembles the sort of physical, moral, or economic

pressure that courts have found sufficient to support a claim under

this statute."          Id. at 318 (internal quotation marks omitted)

(quoting Thomas, 909 F.3d at 493).




                                       - 23 -
               The closest Ember and the Port come to pleading the

existence of such pressure is the statement that MacAskill "nearly

physically assaulted" Jared Brackett (one of the owners of Ember

and The Port).8        The sum total of the allegations describing the

near       physical   assault   is   that   MacAskill   and    Jared   Brackett

"exchanged words" and that "MacAskill had to be restrained by

others from physically attacking Mr. Brackett."               But Ember and The

Port do not allege that this incident was connected to the veiled

threats from MacAskill, which were made at least a year prior, and

Ember and The Port do not allege or plead any additional facts

that would show that the near physical assault was intended to

coerce or intimidate them into refraining from exercising a legal

right.       This omission is fatal for MCRA purposes.            See Damon v.

Hukowicz, 964 F.Supp.2d 120, 150 (D. Mass. 2013) (explaining that

the MCRA requires establishing conduct that amounts to "threats,

intimidation, or coercion" and "an interference, or an attempt to

interfere, with 'rights secured by the constitution or laws of

either the United States or Massachusetts'" (citations omitted)).9



       8Elsewhere in their brief, Ember and The Port state
"Plaintiffs also alleged that Jared Brackett was physically
assaulted by former Board chairman, Michael MacAskill." The record
makes clear, however, that Brackett was not physically assaulted
in fact, but rather "nearly" physically assaulted.
       Since we find no merit to any of Ember and The Port's
       9

constitutional claims, we do not address Harwich's contention that
the Harwich officials are entitled to qualified immunity.      See
Najas Realty, LLC v. Seekonk Water Dist., 821 F.3d 134, 145 n.15


                                      - 24 -
                       2. Civil Conspiracy Claim

            Ember and The Port allege common law conspiracy in Count

V   of   their   complaint.   As   the   district   court   recognized,

"Massachusetts recognizes two types of civil conspiracy."          See

Snyder, 812 F.3d at 52 (quoting Taylor v. Am. Chemistry Council,

576 F.3d 16, 34 (1st Cir. 2009)).        Put simply, one is a form of

vicarious liability, while the other is based on a defendant's

ability to exert a peculiar power of coercion while acting in

unison.    Id.   The district court held that Ember and The Port's

civil conspiracy claim failed because they did not sufficiently

allege either type of civil conspiracy under Massachusetts law.

The court further held that there was no allegation that the

defendants had "peculiar power or coercion" over Ember and The

Port and that there was no allegation that the defendants committed

tortious acts in furtherance of any agreement.

            Ember and The Port argue that "[i]t is obvious that, as

the enforcers of Harwich's liquor license regulations, the Harwich

defendants have a 'peculiar power of coercion' over Plaintiffs."

In this way, their complaint appears to rely on the second form of

civil conspiracy.    Ember and The Port's contention focuses only on

the Harwich defendants' ability to enforce or deny licenses, but

they do not explain how this reflects a particular power of


(1st Cir. 2016) (declining to address arguments on qualified
immunity).


                                - 25 -
coercion the defendants had as a result of working together.                    See

Jurgens v. Abraham, 616 F. Supp. 1381, 1386 (D. Mass. 1985) ("[T]o

state a claim of civil conspiracy, plaintiff must allege that

defendants, acting in unison, had 'some peculiar power of coercion'

over     plaintiff    that    they   would    not    have       had   if     acting

independently." (quoting Fleming v. Dane, 22 N.E.2d 609, 611 (Mass.

1939))). Indeed, Ember and The Port do not allege facts sufficient

to show that the defendants so acted in concert as to be able to

"exert      some     heightened       form    of      coercion"        on       the

Plaintiffs-Appellants.        See Carroll v. Xerox Corp., 294 F.3d 231,

243 (1st Cir. 2002).         Ember and The Port's civil conspiracy claim

thus fails.

                                3. Defamation

            In Count VI, Ember and The Port allege that Sluis made

a defamatory statement and false police report about Ember and The

Port's violation of Massachusetts COVID-19 restrictions.                       They

also allege Larry Ballantine -- Chairman of the Board -- defamed

Ember and The Port regarding the same COVID-19 restrictions.                    The

district court held that Ember and The Port failed to state

defamation claims as to both Sluis and Ballantine.

            "To    properly     allege   defamation,        a    plaintiff     must

specifically       identify    the   allegedly      false       statement,"     and

"allegation[s] that the defendant made statements that 'cast the

plaintiff in a negative light,' but that do[] not identify a


                                     - 26 -
specific statement, [are] not sufficient."               Kelleher v. Lowell

Gen. Hosp., 152 N.E.3d 126, 131 n.2 (Mass. App. Ct. 2020) (citing

Flagg v. AliMed, Inc., 992 N.E.2d 354 (Mass. 2013)).

              As to Sluis, Ember and The Port contend that she falsely

reported to the Harwich Police that Ember and The Port violated

COVID-19 guidance.         The complaint mentions Sluis' call to the

Harwich Police, but it identifies no objectionable statement.

Ember and The Port therefore did not specifically identify any

allegedly false statement; their defamation claim fails as to

Sluis.

              As to Ballantine, Ember and The Port allege that he made

a defamatory statement to the Cape Cod Times -- he stated, with

regard   to    Ember's   and   The   Port's   alleged    violations   of   the

guidance, "Our feeling is this was very flagrant.              They ignored

the whole of COVID-19 regulations."           We assume, without deciding,

that   this    statement   was   defamatory.      Even   so,   Massachusetts

recognizes       a    conditional       common     law     privilege       for

otherwise-defamatory statements.         See Zeigler v. Rater, 939 F.3d

385, 392-93 (1st Cir. 2019).          "Th[is] privilege is particularly

important with respect to public officials because the 'threat of

defamation suits may deter public officials from complying with

their official duties when those duties include the need to make

statements on important public issues.'"          Lawless v. Estrella, 160




                                     - 27 -
N.E.3d 1253, 1260 (Mass. App. Ct. 2020) (quoting Barrows v. Wareham

Fire Dist., 976 N.E.2d 830, 838 (Mass. App. Ct. 2012)).

           The defendants argue that this statement was indeed

conditionally privileged, citing Lawless, 160 N.E.3d at 1260.

Recognizing   that    statements     made    by   public   officials   while

performing their official duties are conditionally privileged,

Ember and The Port argue that it was error for the district court

to conclude, before discovery, that Ballantine was acting in his

role when he made this statement.            See Barrows, 976 N.E.2d at

838-39 (quoting Mulgrew v. Taunton, 574 N.E.2d 389, 392 (Mass.

1991)).   Ember and The Port further argue that discovery would aid

in determining "Ballantine's mindset in whether he was speaking

for himself or for the Board, or whether his statements were made

with the Board's blessing."        This argument is different, however,

than that which Ember and The Port made to the district court.

There, Ember and The Port seemingly conceded that a conditional

privilege existed, noting that abuse of Ballantine's privilege

would cause it to be lost "despite the qualified privilege."

Arguments not spelled out squarely and distinctly in the district

court are waived."         T G Plastics Trading Co., Inc. v. Toray

Plastics (Am.), Inc., 775 F.3d 31, 39 (1st Cir. 2014) (cleaned up)

(quoting United States v. Samboy, 433 F.3d 154, 161 (1st Cir.

2005)).    Ember     and   The   Port's   defamation   claim   fails   as   to

Ballantine for this reason.


                                    - 28 -
             As to O'Neill, Ember and The Port allege that O'Neill

falsely      reported   to    the     Massachusetts         Department     of     Labor

Standards and the Harwich Health Agent that she had witnessed Ember

and The Port violate their liquor and entertainment licenses and

COVID-19 guidance while she was living in Florida.                         In their

complaint, Ember and The Port do not identify any actual statement

made by O'Neill.           Because the complaint does not sufficiently

identify O'Neill's allegedly defamatory statements, Ember and The

Port have failed to state a defamation claim against O'Neill.

             4. Dismissal of State Law Claims with Prejudice

             Ember and The Port briefly argue that the district court

erred   in    dismissing      the    supplemental      state    law   claims      with

prejudice.       We have consistently held, however, that a "federal

court      may     retain      jurisdiction          over      state-law        claims

notwithstanding      the     early   demise     of   all    foundational        federal

claims."     See Rodriguez v. Doral Mortg. Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1177

(1st Cir. 1995) (citing Taylor v. First of Am. Bank-Wayne, 973

F.2d 1284, 1287–88 (6th Cir. 1992)).                 "The baseline rule is that

the dismissal of a foundational federal claim does not deprive a

federal court of authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction

over pendent state-law claims."                 Sexual Minorities Uganda v.

Lively, 899 F.3d 24, 35 (1st Cir. 2018) (citing Lawless, 894 F.3d

at 19).       Given the facts and procedural history of this case,




                                       - 29 -
judicial economy, convenience, and fairness support the district

court's decision to address the state-law claims.

                D. The Request for Leave to Amend

          As a last-ditch attempt, Ember and The Port argue that

they should have been "given at least one chance to amend before

the district court dismissed the action with prejudice."    The crux

of their argument is that limited discovery was "necessary to flesh

out the allegations and attribute them to particular defendants."

In the context of denial of leave to amend, we defer to "the

district court's hands-on judgment so long as the record evinces

an adequate reason for the denial."    Aponte-Torres, 445 F.3d at 58

(citing Grant v. News Grp. Bos., Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.

1995)).   A request for leave to amend a complaint is not an

appropriate vehicle for a second bite at the apple.     See Snyder,

812 F.3d at 51-52.      If a "proposed amendment would be futile

because, as thus amended, the complaint still fails to state a

claim, the district court acts within its discretion in denying

the motion to amend."   Abraham v. Woods Hole Oceanographic Inst.,

553 F.3d 114, 117 (1st Cir. 2009) (citation omitted).

          "When a proffered amendment comes too late, would be an

exercise in futility, or otherwise would serve no useful purpose,

the district court need not allow it."   Aponte-Torres, 445 F.3d at

58 (citations omitted).   Here, we find an adequate basis for the

district court's decision to deny the motion to amend.          The


                              - 30 -
district court found that Ember and The Port had "not specified

any additional facts . . . [that] they would include in a further

amended complaint."    The district court also stated that, even if

Ember and The Port's proposed new allegations were based in fact,

"they would not save any of their claims from dismissal."          As we

have held, the "absence of supporting information may, in and of

itself, be a sufficient reason for the denial of leave to amend."

Id. (citations omitted).   Such is the case here.10      Further, Ember

and The Port did, in fact, amend their complaint once.         See id.

("Plaintiffs   must   exercise   due   diligence   in   amending   their

complaints.    As a corollary of that principle, busy trial courts,

in the responsible exercise of their case management functions,

may refuse to allow plaintiffs an endless number of trips to the

well.").   The district court acted well within its discretion in

denying the second motion to amend.

                           III. CONCLUSION

           For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of

dismissal, grant of judgment on the pleadings, and denial of Ember

and The Port's second request for leave to amend are AFFIRMED.




     10 Ember and The Port's argument that limited discovery was
necessary is not timely. As the defendants point out, Ember and
The Port did not make this argument, or request discovery in their
opposition to the motion to dismiss, below. See Zannino, 895 F.2d
at 17.
