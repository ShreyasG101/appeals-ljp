              [Hon. John D. Levy, U.S. District Judge]


                               Before

                       Barron, Chief Judge,
                 Lynch and Howard, Circuit Judges.


     Daniel J. Schmid, with whom Mathew D. Staver, Horatio G.
Mihet, and Liberty Counsel were on brief, for appellants.
     Kimberly L. Patwardhan, Assistant Attorney General, Office of
the Maine Attorney General, with whom Aaron M. Frey, Attorney
General, and Thomas A. Knowlton, Deputy Attorney General, Chief,

                        January 17, 2025
            LYNCH,   Circuit      Judge.      This     appeal    challenges       the

district court's February 23, 2024 dismissal on mootness grounds

of   appellants'     constitutional        challenge    to     Maine's    COVID-19

vaccine    mandate    for   certain    healthcare           workers,   which      was

originally promulgated by emergency rule on August 12, 2021, no

longer enforced as of July 12, 2023, and repealed by amendment of

the regulation, effective on September 5, 2023.                   See 10-144-264

Me. Code R. § 2 (amended Sept. 5, 2023) (requiring designated

healthcare facilities to "require for all employees who do not

exclusively work remotely a Certificate of Immunization, or Proof

of   Immunity"    against   COVID-19).          The    appellants        are   Maine

healthcare workers who do not exclusively work remotely and who

were    terminated   from   their    employment        at    covered     healthcare

facilities after they refused to comply with the COVID-19 vaccine

mandate based on their religious beliefs.

            In 2021, the appellants filed suit in the United States

District Court for the District of Maine against their former

employers and various Maine government officials, asserting that

the failure of the mandate to provide for religious exemptions

violated, inter alia, the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the

United States Constitution.         On the same day, they filed a motion

for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction,

which    were   denied.     The    appellants     appealed       the     denial    of




                                     - 3 -
preliminary injunctive relief.1       On October 19, 2021, this court

affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction,

Does 1-6 v. Mills, 16 F.4th 20, 37 (1st Cir. 2021), and the Supreme

Court denied the appellants' subsequent application for emergency

injunctive relief, Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S. Ct. 17, 17 (2021).

          On February 14, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss

the complaint for failure to state a claim, which was granted on

August 18, 2022.    In May 2023, this court affirmed in part and

reversed in part, reversing the dismissal of the First Amendment

Free Exercise and Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause

claims   for   declaratory   and     injunctive   relief   against   the

Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services

("MDHHS") and the Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control

and Prevention ("MCDC").     Lowe v. Mills, 68 F.4th 706, 709, 725

(1st Cir. 2023).

          Following the September 2023 repeal of the challenged

regulation, the defendants moved to dismiss these remaining claims

as moot, and their motion was granted.        The district court also

denied the appellants leave to amend the complaint.         This timely

appeal followed.



     1 They also sought an emergency injunction pending appeal in
this court, which was denied the following day. The appellants
appealed to the Supreme Court, which also denied their emergency
application for injunctive relief.    See Does 1-3 v. Mills, No.
21A83, 2021 WL 11710854 (U.S. Oct. 19, 2021).


                                   - 4 -
          On   de   novo   review,   we    affirm   the    district    court's

determinations that the defendant state health officials have met

their burden to show the challenge is moot and that no exceptions

to mootness apply.    See Bos. Bit Labs, Inc. v. Baker, 11 F.4th 3,

8-12 (1st Cir. 2021); Corrigan v. Bos. Univ., 98 F.4th 346, 353-

54 (1st Cir. 2024); Harris v. Univ. of Mass. Lowell, 43 F.4th 187,

194-95 (1st Cir. 2022).     We also affirm the denial of appellants'

request to amend their complaint.         See Palmer v. Champion Mortg.,

465 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2006).

                                      I.

          We have previously recounted the background facts and

procedural history of this matter, including the genesis of the

Maine covered healthcare workers COVID-19 vaccine mandate, see

Lowe, 68 F.4th at 709-13; Does 1-6, 16 F.4th at 24-28.                We focus

here on the facts bearing on the repeal of the Maine mandate and

the mootness issue.

          On January 30, 2023, the Biden administration announced

its intent to extend the COVID-19 health emergency to May 11, 2023,

and then to end it on that date.           On May 1, 2023, the federal

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") announced that

it would soon end the requirement that covered healthcare providers

require staff vaccination against COVID-19.               The federal public

health emergency ended on May 11, 2023, as planned.              Because the

Maine public health emergency was designed to be in effect through


                                 - 5 -
the duration of the federal public health emergency, it too ended

on May 11, 2023.   This court published its opinion on May 25, 2023,

reinstating the claims discussed.       Lowe, 68 F.4th at 706.   CMS

formally withdrew its COVID-19 vaccination requirement on June 5,

2023.   See Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Policy and Regulatory

Changes to the Omnibus COVID-19 Health Care Staff Vaccination

Requirements, 88 Fed. Reg. 36,485 (June 5, 2023) (codified at 42

C.F.R. pts. 416, 418, 441, 460, 482-86, 491, 494).

          On July 11, 2023, MDHHS announced that it was proposing

to end the requirement that employees be vaccinated against COVID-

19 and that it would not enforce the requirement during the

pendency of the procedural requirements to repeal the regulation.

In the announcement, MDHHS explained:

          While   COVID-19   vaccination    remains   an
          important tool to protect public health, the
          vaccination requirement for health care
          workers achieved the intended benefits of
          saving lives, protecting health care capacity,
          and limiting the spread of the virus in Maine
          during the height of the pandemic.     Despite
          having the oldest population in the nation,
          Maine consistently rated among the top states
          in the country on vaccination and among the
          lowest on COVID-19 deaths.    Maine currently
          ranks third on bivalent booster vaccination
          overall and first for those age 65 and older.
          Additionally,      Maine      health      care
          professionals' strong culture of patient
          safety has limited risk of severe COVID-19
          being spread among staff and patients.

          The Department filed the proposed rule change
          with the Secretary of State today based on
          available clinical and epidemiological data


                                - 6 -
           about COVID-19, increased population immunity
           resulting    from   vaccination    and   prior
           infections,   decreasing   disease   severity,
           improved treatments, and declining infection
           and death rates.       This follows [CMS's]
           withdrawal of its requirement for COVID-19
           vaccination of health care workers on June 6,
           2023.   Maine is among four remaining states
           with   some    type   of   COVID-19    vaccine
           requirement.

Per Maine law, the amendment of the regulation went through public

notice and comment.    The Rulemaking Fact Sheet stated, in part:

           This proposed change is based on available
           clinical and epidemiological data about COVID-
           19, increased population immunity resulting
           from   vaccination   and   prior   infections,
           decreasing    disease    severity,    improved
           treatments, and declining infection and death
           rates.    In addition, [CMS] in June 2023
           withdrew the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for
           healthcare employees, following the May 11,
           2023 end of the federal Public Health
           Emergency for COVID-19.

The proposal entailed removing COVID-19 from the list of specified

infectious diseases against which immunizations are required and

other   changes   reflecting   that   removal.   The   changed   MDHHS

regulation became effective on September 5, 2023.

           In support of its post-repeal motion to dismiss and in

addition to the public records described above, the Deputy Director

of the MCDC, an office within MDHHS, submitted a declaration.     The

MDHHS Declaration stated that since November of 2021, MDHHS and

MCDC had continued to monitor the COVID-19 public health situation

in Maine, and that MDHHS began planning for the end of the public



                                 - 7 -
health emergency in early 2023, by "identifying programs and

services that would be ending or transitioning back to pre-COVID

standards."       "Around the end of May 2023 and beginning of June

2023,"    MDHHS   and     MCDC     also   conducted      a   review   of    available

scientific     data     and      research     regarding      COVID-19      risks   in

healthcare settings as part of an evaluation of state rules and

policies, including the state's COVID-19 vaccine requirement for

healthcare workers.         "This review was triggered by the end of the

federal public health emergency, the announcement that CMS would

be   rescinding     its    COVID-19       vaccine    requirement,      and    changed

circumstances regarding COVID-19 variants, vaccination[] rates,

and disease prevalence."           The MDHHS Declaration contained detailed

information and data supporting the repeal, including, inter alia,

changes and developments as to new COVID-19 variants, antiviral

treatments,       antigen        tests,     further      vaccine      developments,

vaccination rates, and hospitalization rates.                  It stated that, on

the basis of that information, MDHHS "concluded that it would no

longer    be   necessary      to    require       that   [designated       healthcare

facilities] ensure their employees are vaccinated against COVID-

19."     The MDHHS Declaration contained two pages of exhibits: a

graph of COVID-19 hospitalization data between late 2021 and late




                                          - 8 -
2023, and a graph of daily COVID-19 deaths from January 2022 to

September 2023.2

            The appellants opposed dismissal but did not put in any

evidence and chose not to depose any state officials.      They do not

contest the accuracy of the defendants' data but strenuously argue

the data does not support mootness.

            In holding that the challenges were moot, the district

court rejected the appellants' argument that they had mounted a

facial attack on the statute authorizing the challenged regulation

and setting forth exemptions.     See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22,

§ 802.     The district court concluded that the appellants had

mounted "an as-applied challenge to the tandem operation of the

pre-repeal regulation and statute, but no more."        Lowe v. Mills,

718 F. Supp. 3d 69, 75 (D. Me. 2024).3           The statute merely


     2   The MDHHS Declaration also stated that MDHHS
            has no plans to include COVID-19 again among
            the   diseases   against   which    [designated
            healthcare facilities] must ensure their
            employees are vaccinated against in the
            healthcare worker vaccination rule. . . .
            [B]ased   on   the   available   clinical   and
            epidemiological     data    about     COVID-19,
            increased population immunity resulting from
            vaccination and prior infections, decreasing
            disease severity, improved treatments, and
            declining hospitalization and death rates, it
            is highly unlikely that [MDHHS] will seek to
            impose COVID-19 vaccination requirements on
            [designated healthcare facilities] in the
            future.

     3   The district court concluded that the appellants treated


                                - 9 -
authorizes MDHHS to promulgate by regulation requirements, but it

does not specify the diseases or itself mention COVID-19, and it

authorizes only certain exemptions.    See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.

22, § 802(4-B).

          The district court then held the repeal of the COVID-19

vaccine regulation mooted the case because the court "[could not]

provide any relief to the Plaintiffs that would redress injuries

that arise from an actual case or controversy."   Lowe, 718 F. Supp.

3d at 79.    The district court further held that neither the

"voluntary cessation" nor the "capable of repetition yet evading

review" exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied.     Id. at 79-

82.

          In holding that the defendants had met their burden to

show the voluntary cessation exception did not apply, the court

rejected the appellants' argument that the defendants "engaged in

a bad faith litigation tactic" in repealing the mandate soon after

our May 25, 2023 opinion.    Id. at 80-81.     The court held that

argument "[did] not account[] for obviously relevant Federal and


the governor's August 21, 2021 announcement as the challenged
mandate, which referred to the state regulation. Lowe v. Mills,
718 F. Supp. 3d 69, 75 (D. Me. 2024). Moreover, the district court
noted that the regulation rather than the statute imposed the
challenged COVID-19 vaccination requirement, and the statute's
"exemptions only take effect in this context when the regulation
is enforced." Id. at 76. The district court further concluded
that no facial challenge existed because the appellants challenged
only the statute's application to COVID-19 vaccinations, and not
the other vaccines required under the regulation. Id. at 76-77.


                              - 10 -
State governmental actions, [and] is based on a substantially

incomplete and, therefore, misleading narrative of the relevant

events."   Id. at 81.    The court also noted that the appellants had

"not supported their position with declarations under oath or

exhibits, nor ha[d] they requested permission to perform discovery

on the issue."   Id.

           The exception for conduct capable of repetition but

evading review likewise did not apply because the appellants had

"fail[ed] to present any positive, non-speculative evidence to

support a reasonable expectation that they will be subject to the

challenged    COVID-19     vaccination    requirement     --   or   one

substantially similar to it -- again."      Id.

           The court denied appellants' request for leave to amend

the complaint, made in their opposition.     Id. at 77.    The district

court held that "justice does not require permitting the Plaintiffs

to further amend the Amended Complaint to drastically broaden the

scope of their claims to challenge all possible applications of

the [designated healthcare facilities] worker immunization rule

and the Department's authorizing statute."        Id.     Moreover, the

appellants "ha[d] not identified any post-filing transactions,

occurrences, or events that would justify additional amendments"

under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d).      Id.

                                      II.

           We review the mootness determination de novo.            Bos. Bit

Labs, 11 F.4th at 8.

A.   Appellants have not mounted a facial challenge to the statute

           The   district     court    correctly   concluded     that   the

appellants' complaint did not present a facial challenge to the

statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 802. Appellants' challenge

was only to that portion of the regulation, 10-144-264 Me. Code R.

§ 2(A), concerning COVID-19 vaccinations which was in existence

from August 12, 2021 to September 5, 2023.           The statute itself

says nothing about a COVID-19 mandate and merely authorizes MDHHS

to promulgate vaccination requirements with certain exceptions.

See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 802(4-B).             Indeed, in their

amended complaint, the appellants describe the target of their

challenge as "the Governor's COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate," the very

term that they use elsewhere in the amended complaint to identify

the emergency rule -- but not the enabling statute -- that added

COVID-19 to the list of required vaccinations in Chapter 264.

Further,   the   appellants   have    not   challenged   the   regulation's

still-existing    vaccination    requirements      for   measles,    mumps,

rubella, varicella, hepatitis B, and influenza.            See 10-144-264

Me. Code R. § 2(A); Lowe, 718 F. Supp. 3d at 76-77.        The appellants

have only ever challenged the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, a

fact that they do not dispute on appeal.           Appellants may not on



                                 - 12 -
appeal recharacterize their challenge as a facial attack on the

statute.

B.     Appellants' claims are moot

              "The 'heavy' burden of showing mootness is on the party

raising the issue."       Bos. Bit Labs, 11 F.4th at 8 (quoting Connectu

LLC v. Zuckerberg, 522 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2008)).               The state

officials have met their burden to show that the appellants' claims

for    relief    are    moot.    "Article      III   limits    federal    court

jurisdiction to 'cases' and 'controversies.'"             O'Neil v. Canton

Police Dep't, 116 F.4th 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2024) (quoting U.S. Const.

art. III, § 2).         "The doctrine of mootness enforces the mandate

'that an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of the

review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.'"                 Mangual

v. Rotger-Sabat, 317 F.3d 45, 60 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Steffel

v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459 n.10 (1974)).             "[A] case is moot

when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack

a legally cognizable interest in the outcome . . . . [or] the court

cannot give any effectual relief to the potentially prevailing

party."    Bayley's Campground, Inc. v. Mills, 985 F.3d 153, 157

(1st Cir. 2021) (first alteration in original) (quoting Town of

Portsmouth v. Lewis, 813 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 2016)); see also

ACLU of Mass. v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops, 705 F.3d 44, 52-53

(1st   Cir.     2013)    (dismissal    is   required   where    "events    have




                                      - 13 -
transpired to render a court opinion merely advisory" (quoting

Mangual, 317 F.3d at 60)).

            The appellants sought "a permanent injunction . . .

restraining and enjoining [state] Defendants . . . from enforcing,

threatening    to   enforce,    attempting      to   enforce,   or   otherwise

requiring     compliance     with     the   Governor's    COVID-19     Vaccine

Mandate."    Because the COVID-19 vaccine mandate has been repealed

by way of COVID-19's removal from Chapter 264, and it has not been

reinstated, there is simply "no ongoing conduct to enjoin," and

the claim for injunctive relief is accordingly moot.                 Bos. Bit

Labs, 11 F.4th at 9 (quoting Lewis, 813 F.3d at 58) (claim for

injunctive    relief   was     moot     where   executive   order    imposing

challenged COVID-19 restriction was no longer in effect).

            In order   for appellants'          request "[f]or declaratory

relief to withstand a mootness challenge, the facts alleged must

'show that there is a substantial controversy . . . of sufficient

immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory

judgment.'"    ACLU of Mass., 705 F.3d at 53-54 (emphasis omitted)

(second alteration in original) (quoting Preiser v. Newkirk, 422

U.S. 395, 402 (1975)).       Because the COVID-19 vaccination mandate

no longer exists and is "no longer in controversy," this request

for relief "is at this point neither immediate nor real."                 Bos.

Bit Labs, 11 F.4th at 9 (second quoting Lewis, 813 F.3d at 58).

Our sister circuits have also held that challenges to COVID-19

vaccination requirements become moot when those requirements are

rescinded.     See, e.g., Donovan v. Vance, 70 F.4th 1167, 1172 (9th

Cir. 2023) (holding that case including claims for declaratory and

injunctive     relief   was   moot    after    challenged     executive    orders

creating COVID-19 vaccine mandate no longer existed); Marciano v.

Adams, No. 22-570-CV, 2023 WL 3477119, at *1 (2d Cir. May 16, 2023)

COVID-19 vaccine mandate had been repealed and we "cannot enjoin

was withdrawn).

C.   Exceptions to mootness do not apply

            A primary focus of the appellants' argument to us is

their contention that the exceptions               to mootness apply.         We

disagree.      The state defendants have met their burden of showing

that the voluntary cessation doctrine does not apply.                 See Bos.

Bit Labs, 11 F.4th at 10.             The appellants bear the burden of

showing that the exception for conduct capable of repetition yet




                                      - 15 -
evading review applies, Gulf of Me. Fishermen's All. v. Daley, 292

F.3d 84, 89 (1st Cir. 2002), and have not met that burden.

           The voluntary cessation doctrine creates an exception to

mootness where two tests are met: "'a defendant voluntar[ily]

ceases the challenged practice in order to moot the plaintiff's

case and there exists a reasonable expectation that the challenged

conduct will be repeated' after the suit's 'dismissal.'"   Bos. Bit

Labs, 11 F.4th at 9 (alteration in original) (emphasis added)

(quoting Lewis, 813 F.3d at 59).       Under the first test, the

exception does not apply to changes in conduct that are "unrelated

to the litigation," given that the exception "exists to stop a

scheming defendant from trying to 'immuniz[e] itself from suit

indefinitely' by unilaterally changing 'its behavior long enough

to secure a dismissal' and then backsliding when the judge is out

of the picture."    Id. at 10 (alteration in original) (quoting

Lewis, 813 F.3d at 59).

           We begin our analysis with the second test: whether "it

is 'absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could

not reasonably be expected to recur.'"    Calvary Chapel of Bangor

v. Mills, 52 F.4th 40, 47 (1st Cir. 2022) (quoting Friends of the

Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Env't Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189

(2000)).

     i.    The challenged conduct is not reasonably expected to
           recur

           The defendant state health officials have met their

burden to show that the challenged conduct "[can]not reasonably be

expected to recur."      Id. (quoting Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S.

at 189).   The MDHHS Declaration states that MDHHS "has no plans to

include    COVID-19     again   among   the   diseases    against   which

[designated healthcare facilities] must ensure their employees are

vaccinated against in the healthcare worker vaccination rule."

The COVID-19 vaccine mandate also has not been reinstated in the

nineteen months since its enforcement ended and in the seventeen

plus months since its repeal.       See id. at 49 (voluntary cessation

exception did not apply in part because state had not attempted to

"reinstate"   or      "impose   anything   like   the    complained-about

restrictions" in intervening months).

           On this record, it is extremely unlikely that the risks

presented by any future variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus would

require the reinstatement of the same or an equivalent vaccine

mandate.   See Bos. Bit Labs, 11 F.4th at 11 (the conclusion that

the Governor would again declare a COVID-19 emergency and re-

institute previous policies was "unrealistically speculative");

Corrigan, 98 F.4th at 353 (Because "there are no signs that the

pandemic will worsen, it is not reasonable to expect that BU again




                                  - 17 -
will impose a similar testing program.").4         The regulation was

geared to the risks from the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it existed at the

time the regulation was in force, and the developments since

regarding   vaccination   rates    (including   vaccination   rates   for

healthcare workers), circulating variants, disease prevalence, and

available tests, treatments, and new vaccines have all reduced

those risks.   As to vaccination rates, as of October 31, 2021,

COVID-19 vaccination rates for healthcare workers in Maine in

various workplaces ranged from 92.6 percent to 98.1 percent.

Between May 28, 2023 and June 30, 2023, 93.3 percent of all


     4  This case is easily distinguishable from Bayley's
Campground, in which this court determined that the challenge there
to a COVID-19 restriction was not moot because the state defendants
had not met their burden of showing that the allegedly wrongful
behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur. See 985 F.3d
153, 157-58 (1st Cir. 2021).         In Bayley's Campground, the
challenged COVID-19 restriction had not been rescinded entirely,
as here, but merely replaced with a less strict version, and
indeed, without the check of a rulemaking process like that
required of MDHHS under Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, § 8052, the
state could have unilaterally done so as the "dynamic" public
health conditions evolved. See id. at 156-57; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.
tit. 37-B, § 742.    Moreover, the time that elapsed between the
challenged restriction's implementation and removal was about two
months; in contrast, the repeal of the regulation at issue here
reflects enduring changes in the COVID-19 pandemic over the course
of nearly two years. See id. at 155-56. The Bayley's Campground
court also observed that the state defendant "has not denied that
a spike in the spread of the virus in Maine could lead her to
impose a self-quarantine requirement just as strict as [the
challenged measure]."    Id. at 157.    Here, the state defendants
have declared that "it is highly unlikely that [MDHHS] will seek
to impose COVID-19 vaccination requirements on [designated
healthcare facilities] in the future," a prediction corroborated
by lasting trends in disease prevalence, vaccine availability and
acceptance, and treatment efficacy.


                                  - 18 -
essential healthcare workers in Maine had completed the primary

series of COVID-19 vaccinations, with 99.8 percent having received

at least one dose.     Data from July 31, 2023 indicated that, at

that time, 91.9 percent of adults in Maine had completed a primary

series of COVID-19 vaccinations and 31.2 percent had received at

least one additional dose of a bivalent vaccine, which targeted

more variants of the virus.

            The data on which MDHHS relied showed that, as to changes

in circulating variants, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has mutated a number

of times.     Since the regulation was implemented, the Omicron

variant became the predominant variant in the United States, and

the Omicron variant caused fewer deaths and hospitalizations per

year on a population level than had the Delta variant of 2021 or

the variants circulating in 2020.

            The data on which MDHHS relied showed that prevalence of

the   COVID-19   disease   had   also    diminished.    Data   regarding

hospitalization rates in 2023 relative to 2022 showed an overall

decrease.    For example, in June of 2023, the average number of

hospitalized COVID-19 patients per day in Maine had been thirty-

seven, compared with 137 in June 2022.         COVID-19 deaths likewise

declined between 2022 and 2023.         In June of 2023, there were ten

COVID-19 deaths in Maine, compared with fifty-seven in June 2022.

            The data also showed new and effective treatments had

been developed: three antiviral treatments for COVID-19 including


                                 - 19 -
Paxlovid and Lagrevio.            COVID-19 antigen tests have also become

widely available since 2021, when Maine experienced a shortage.

Bivalent formulations and booster doses of vaccines were approved,

and in late 2021 and 2022, the FDA expanded authorizations for

children of certain ages to receive different vaccines.                   In August

2022, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the Novavax

COVID-19 vaccine for people who are unable or unwilling to receive

an mRNA vaccine.        All of these data support MDHHS' conclusion that

it was "highly unlikely" they would ever promulgate an equivalent

COVID-19 vaccine mandate regulation.

               Nor   does   the   fact    that    the    defendant     state   health

officials have the authority to promulgate regulations as to future

events negate mootness.            As held in Bos. Bit Labs, "[t]hat the

Governor has the power to issue executive orders cannot itself be

enough    to    skirt   mootness,     because      then    no   suit   against   the

government would ever be moot.             And we know some are."          11 F.4th

at 10; see Calvary Chapel, 52 F.4th at 49 (rejecting argument that

voluntary cessation exception applied because appellant "face[d]

a constant threat that [the Governor] will use [her] power to

restore    [COVID-19]       restrictions     that       (allegedly)    discriminate

against religious services").

     ii.       Repeal of the mandate was not done to moot the litigation

               Although, strictly speaking, the voluntary cessation

doctrine does not apply if the party seeking mootness can show


                                         - 20 -
either that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected

to recur or that it was ceased for a non-litigation reason, the

defendant state officials have independently demonstrated that the

"voluntary" repeal of the COVID-19 regulatory vaccine mandate was

not done in order to moot the case.                   The evidence of record

demonstrates that when MDHHS instituted the regulation, it did so

in response to its own assessment of the risks posed by the Delta

variant    circulating   at    the    time     and   the   risk   posed   by   the

circulating COVID-19 variants to its citizens and its healthcare

workers.      The   repeal     of    the   regulation      followed     the    same

characteristic behavior.

            After   imposing    the    vaccine       mandate,   MDHHS   and    MCDC

continued to monitor the COVID-19 public health situation in Maine.

In early 2023, when the federal government announced that the

public health emergency would end on May 11, MDHHS began planning

for the end of Maine's public health emergency, which was set to

terminate on the same date.           In early May, CMS announced that it

planned to rescind the federal vaccine requirement, which it did

on June 5, 2023.      Following these events, and in recognition of

"changed circumstances regarding COVID-19 variants, vaccination

rates, and disease prevalence," around the end of May and the

beginning of June, MDHHS began a review of the available science

and research undergirding its vaccine requirement.                It concluded,

based on the changed COVID-19 risk in Maine, that the mandate was


                                      - 21 -
no longer necessary.      Accordingly, after conducting this evidence-

based review, MDHHS announced on July 11, 2023 that it would be

repealing the mandate.        This approach -- sensitive to changes in

the COVID-19 virus and informed by scientific research -- is the

same   approach    that   Maine    has    taken    regarding    other    COVID-19

policies.    See, e.g., Calvary Chapel, 52 F.4th at 48 (determining

that Governor Mills rescinded COVID-19 policies based on "expert

advice" and evolving information about case counts, positivity

rates, and vaccination rates).

            The appellants argue that the timing shows that it was

this   court's    reinstatement     of    their    claims    and   remand      which

motivated the Maine health officials to revoke the regulation.

They support this contention by pointing to evidence showing that

"the   number     of   hospitalizations      and    deaths     were     increasing

dramatically at the exact time of Defendants' repeal."                           The

appellants point only to two months of data, but the complete set

of data that the state reviewed showed an overall decline in

hospitalizations and deaths since the vaccine mandate was issued.

The increases that appellants point to also represent small numeric

shifts,    not   "dramatic"   increases:      three    deaths      in   July    2023

relative    to    eight   deaths     in    August     2023,    and      thirty-one




                                    - 22 -
hospitalized COVID-19 patients per day in July 2023 relative to

forty-four in August 2023.5

          In   light   of   contemporaneous    events   and   documented

changes   in   the   COVID-19     pandemic   that   reasonably   explain

defendants' decision to review and repeal the vaccine mandate, and

the "presumption of regularity" typically accorded governmental

decision-making in this context, Health Freedom Def. Fund, Inc. v.

Carvalho, 104 F.4th 715 (9th Cir. 2024), the mere fact of an

overlap with this court's opinion does not plausibly suggest the

conclusion that the repeal of the regulation was motivated by an

effort to moot out the case.      Coincidence is not causation.

     iii. Capable of repetition yet evading review exception does
          not apply

          Appellants have not met their burden to show that the

final exception to mootness for conduct capable of repetition yet

evading review applies.         "[T]he capable-of-repetition doctrine



     5 The appellants argue that an out-of-circuit case, Health
Freedom   Def. Fund, Inc. v. Carvalho, 104 F.4th 715 (9th Cir.
2024), supports their argument.     Not so.    In that case, the
defendants had "withdraw[n] and reinstat[ed]" their COVID-19
vaccination policies directly following litigation events multiple
times without a clear public health rationale.     Id. at 719-22.
And, in denying the defendants a "presumption of regularity" to
which they would otherwise have been entitled, the court relied on
specific comments made by defendants that "confirm[ed] that [the]
policy rescission aimed to avoid litigation." Id. at 723. There
was also no evidence that the decision to repeal the mandate
tracked with any change in federal regulations or guidance
regarding COVID-19, as there is here. See id. at 721 n.2 (policy
withdrawal occurred in September 2023).

Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109 (1983)); see also Kingdomware Techs., Inc.

v.   United    States,    579   U.S.    162,    170    (2016).    To   prove    the

exception, an appellant "must show that '(1) the challenged action

was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its

cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation

that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same

action again.'"          Daley, 292 F.3d at 89 (quoting Weinstein v.

Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975) (per curiam)).

              The appellants have not met their burden as to either

prong.    As to the first prong, appellants "must show that 'the

generic types of claims that they seek to pursue are likely to

evade    review.'"       Harris,   43    F.4th    at    194   (quoting   Cruz   v.

Farquharson, 252 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir. 2001)). Here, the factual

circumstances -- a disease outbreak and corresponding vaccination

regulation -- are not, per se, of the "inherently transitory"

nature that always evades review. See, e.g., ACLU of Mass., 705

F.3d at 57 (collecting cases); Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U.S. 814, 816

(1969) (some challenges to elections are capable of repetition yet

evading review because "while the 1968 election is over, [the

challenged burden] remains and controls future elections, as long

as [the state defendant] maintains her present system as she has

done since 1935"); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973) ("[W]hen


                                       - 24 -

overruled on other grounds by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org.,

597 U.S. 215 (2022); Neb. Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539,

546-47     (1976)   (temporary   restraining   orders   were   capable   of

repetition yet evading review because "these orders are by nature

short-lived").      Nor were they "'in [their] duration too short to

be fully litigated' through the . . . courts (and arrive [at the

Supreme Court]) prior to its 'expiration.'"       Turner v. Rogers, 564

U.S. 431, 440 (2011)(quoting First Nat'l Bank of Bos. v. Bellotti,

435 U.S. 765, 774 (1978)); see also Harris, 43 F.4th at 194

(holding that plaintiffs must show "a realistic threat [exists]

that no trial court ever will have enough time to decide the

underlying issue[]" (quoting Cruz, 252 F.3d at 535)).          The claims

here are not like those that the Supreme Court has recognized as

"inherently transitory": the vaccine mandate could have been in

effect for much longer or even permanently had the public health

situation evolved differently.      It was not "by nature short-lived"

along the lines of elections, pregnancy, or temporary restraining

orders.6     Neb. Press Ass'n, 427 U.S. at 547.         Indeed, we have


     6 Appellants argue that the mandate was inherently transitory
because the state defendants admitted in the MDHHS declaration
"that the public health emergency upon which the Vaccine Mandate
was purportedly based, and their consideration of compulsory


                                  - 25 -
similarly      held   that   challenges     to   a   university's     COVID-19

vaccination requirements were "not among or closely analogous to"

types of claims recognized as "inherently transitory."              Corrigan,

98 F.4th at 353 (quoting Harris, 43 F.4th at 194).           The appellants

have also not shown that "a realistic threat" exists that there

would be insufficient time to obtain a judgment on the merits

before the repeal of the mandate.           See id. at 353 (quoting Cruz,

252 F.3d at 535).

            The duration of the vaccine mandate here was similar to

durations in other cases holding that the exception does not apply.

See Corrigan, 98 F.4th at 353 (holding that, with regard to a

COVID-19 vaccination requirement, "[i]t is struthious at best to

suggest that a resource-intensive effort continuously spanning

almost two years is so fleeting that a court could never have time

to pass on its legality"); Robert v. Austin, 72 F.4th 1160, 1165

(10th   Cir.    2023)   (holding   that   duration    of   COVID-19   vaccine

mandate, which was in effect for about a year and a half, was not

too short to be fully litigated such that "capable of repetition

but evading review" exception did not apply); see also Fund for

Animals, Inc. v. Hogan, 428 F.3d 1059, 1064 (D.C. Cir. 2005) ("As



vaccination programs, were transitory and subject to change." This
argument fails. The MDHHS declaration merely describes reviewing
COVID-19 policies in light of evolving data and federal guidance
and does not establish that the vaccine mandate was definitionally
temporary.

a general rule, two years is enough time for a dispute to be

litigated.").

              As to the second prong, for the reasons we have already

pointed out, the appellants have simply not shown that they will

be subject to the same regulation again.            See Corrigan, 98 F.4th

at 354; see also Resurrection Sch. v. Hertel, 35 F.4th 524, 530

(6th   Cir.    2022)   (en   banc)   (capable-of-repetition-yet-evading-

review exception was "inapposite for largely the same reasons" as

voluntary cessation because "the challenged mandate was a product

of the pandemic's early stages, and . . . . [w]e are unlikely to

see this mandate in a similar form again").

                                       III.

              We review the district court's denial of the appellants'

request for leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion.

See, e.g., Palmer, 465 F.3d at 30.            The district court's decision

will be affirmed "so long as the record evinces an adequate reason

for the denial," such as "undue delay, bad faith, futility, [or]

the absence of due diligence on the movant's part."              Id. at 30

(first quoting Aponte-Torres v. Univ. of P.R., 445 F.3d 50, 58

(1st Cir. 2006)).      The district court did not abuse its discretion

in holding that "justice does not require permitting the Plaintiffs

to further amend the Amended Complaint to drastically broaden the

scope of their claims" by creating a previously-nonexistent facial

challenge to the statute.


                                     - 27 -
              The district court also did not abuse its discretion in

denying the appellants leave to file supplemental pleadings under

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(d).             The motion sought to amend

to change the attack to one on all aspects of the regulation and

to bring a facial attack on the statute.                The statute and the

regulation preexisted the filing of the suit.               Rule 15(d) permits

courts   to    allow    supplemental     pleadings    to    add   transactions,

occurrences,     or    events   that    happened    after   the   date   of   the

pleading.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d).           The appellants filed the

amended complaint on July 11, 2022, never filed a separate motion

for leave to amend, and never identified any relevant subsequent

transactions, occurrences, or events that would prevent mootness.

              We affirm the district court's dismissal of this suit as

moot and the denial of the motion to amend.
