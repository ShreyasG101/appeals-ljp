reason_for_appeal: '=== Plaintiffs-Appellants (Erik Blecher et al.)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the District Court erred in concluding that their claims, alleging that the bishops engaged in tortious conduct when they carried out the Holy See’s mandatory secrecy policy, fall within the discretionary function exclusion from the FSIA’s tortious activity exception.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that the Complaint plausibly alleges tortious conduct that involved no discretion by the bishops, because the bishops’ conduct was compelled by the Holy See’s mandatory secrecy policy, and therefore their claims necessarily fall outside the ambit of the discretionary function exclusion for purposes of the Berkovitz/Gaubert test.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the fact that the tort claim is plausibly alleged to be based on a mandatory regulation or requirement of the foreign state forecloses application of the discretionary function exclusion and ends the inquiry.

  4. Plaintiffs asserted that the District Court improperly applied the discretionary function exclusion by failing to recognize that the bishops’ actions were not discretionary but rather mandated by the Holy See’s policy.

  5. Plaintiffs further argued that there can be no plausible policy justification for maintaining the strict secrecy of illegal conduct, i.e., cleric sexual abuse of children, and thus the challenged conduct was not susceptible to policy analysis under the second prong of the Berkovitz/Gaubert test.'
