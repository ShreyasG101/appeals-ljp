outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Govanni R. Nunez''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Nunez argued that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) failed to support the determination of his mental residual functional capacity (RFC) with substantial evidence.

  2. Nunez contended that the ALJ''s RFC determination did not reflect any limitations regarding his inability to sustain an ordinary work routine, despite the vocational expert''s testimony and unanimous medical opinions indicating he had limitations in staying on task and maintaining regular work attendance.

  3. Nunez asserted that the ALJ erred by not including limitations in the RFC related to his ability to be on task for at least 90% of the workday and to attend work regularly, missing no more than one day per month, as required for employment.

  4. Nunez claimed that the ALJ improperly rejected or discounted the medical opinions in the record, which consistently found at least moderate limitations in his ability to sustain an ordinary routine and regular attendance at work.

  5. Nunez argued that the ALJ''s evaluation of the persuasiveness of the medical opinions was not supported by substantial evidence, particularly regarding the supportability and consistency of his treating psychiatrist''s opinion.

  6. Nunez contended that the ALJ improperly discounted his own testimony and self-reports, which were consistent with the medical opinions and treatment notes, and that the ALJ''s reasons for doing so were not supported by the record.

  7. Nunez asserted that the ALJ''s errors at step four of the disability determination process infected the step five analysis, resulting in an unsupported finding that there were jobs in the national economy he could perform.'
