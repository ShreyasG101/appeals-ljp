YORK CITY, New York, and KEECHANT 
SEWELL, in her official capacity as NYPD 
Comnnissioner, 
                        Defendants. 

NELSON S. ROMAN, United States District Judge: 
      Plaintiffs Jason Frey, Brianna Frey,  Jack Cheng,  and William Sappe bring this action 
against  the  Acting  Superintendent  of the  New  York  State  Police,  Steven Nigrelli  (“Acting 
Superintendent” or “State Defendant”), and New York City and the NYPD Police Commissioner, 
Keechant Sewell (together, the “City Defendants”), which challenges the following statutes for 
purportedly violating  Second Amendment rights:  N.Y.  Penal  Law  §§  400.00(6),  400.00(15), 
265.01, 265.01-b, 265.01-d, 265.01-e, 265.03(3), and NYC Admin. Code § 10-315.  (See ECF No. 
47, Second Amended Compliant or “SAC”).  On March 13, 2023, the Court issued an Opinion and 
Order denying Plaintiffs’ third motion for preliminary injunction in part and stayed decision in 
part.  (See ECF No.  80.) Presently before the Court is Plaintiffs’  motion for injunctive relief 
pending interlocutory appeal, pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1), which requires Plaintiffs to make 
this instant motion first before the district court before seeking the same relief before the Second 
Circuit.  (See ECF No. 86 (“Pls.” Mem.”) at 1.)

    For the reasons stated below, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction 
pending appeal.                                                           
                            BACKGROUND                                   
    The Court assumes familiarity with the underlying facts, described in the Court’s March 

13, 2023 Opinion and Order.  (See ECF No. 80) See Frey v. Nigrelli, No. 21 CV 05334 (NSR), 
2023 WL 2473375 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2023).  In summary, Plaintiffs commenced this instant 
action on June 16, 2021, seeking to challenge numerous provisions of the N.Y. Penal Laws as 
violating the Second Amendment.  (See ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiffs requested leave to file a motion for 
preliminary injunction, which was filed and fully briefed on September 21, 2021. (ECF No. 20.) 
Oral argument on the preliminary injunction was held on February 1, 2022, and the Court 
subsequently issued a decision denying the injunction on February 22, 2022. (ECF No. 37.) 
    On June 23, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol 
Ass'n, Inc. v. Bruen, ––– U.S. ––––, 142 S. Ct. 2111, 2156, 213 L.Ed.2d 387 (2022).  In that 
decision, among other things, the U.S. Supreme Court announced a new standard of review when 

evaluating whether a regulation violates the Second Amendment, and expressly rejected the 
previous approach widely used by federal courts.  See Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2126.  Following the 
Bruen decision, on September 1, 2022, the State of New York amended its existing gun laws via 
the Concealed Carry Improvement Act (“CCIA”).                             
     On  August  22,  2022,  Plaintiffs  requested  permission  to  file  a  Second  Motion  for 
Preliminary Injunction based on the holding in Bruen. (ECF No. 42.) On September 1, 2022, the 
Court issued a Decision and Order denying Plaintiffs' request for a Second Preliminary Injunction 
and granted State Defendant's motion to dismiss the Complaint. (ECF No. 44.) Plaintiffs filed an 
Amended Complaint and a Second Amended Complaint on October 4, 2022 and October 14, 2022, 
challenging various provisions of New York’s revised gun laws.  (See ECF Nos. 46 and 47.)  
Plaintiffs Jason Frey, Brianna Frey, and William Sappe filed a third motion for preliminary 
injunction on October 20, 2022. (ECF No. 48.) The parties fully briefed their arguments on the 
third motion for preliminary injunction on December 15, 2022.             

    On March 13, 2023, following oral argument, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ third preliminary 
injunction with respect to Plaintiffs’ challenge to N.Y. Penal Law §§ 400.00(6), 400.00(15), 
265.01, 265.01-b, 265.03(3), N.Y. Penal Law §§ 265.01-e(2)(n) (with regards to the MTA subway 
and rails), 265.01-e(2)(t), and NYC Admin. Code § 10-315.  Frey, 2023 WL 2473375, at *21 (the 
“March 13, 2023 Opinion and Order”).  The Court also stayed its decision on the third preliminary 
injunction motion with respect to Plaintiffs’ challenge of N.Y. Penal Law §§ 265.01-d, 265.01-
e(2)(d), 265.01-e(2)(p), and 265.01-e(2)(o) pending resolution by the Second Circuit in Antonyuk 
et al., v. Hochul, et al., C.A. No. 22-2908 (2d Cir. filed Nov. 9, 2022).  Id.  
    On March 16, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of interlocutory appeal of the March 13, 2023 
Opinion and Order.  (See ECF No. 81.)  That same day, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for 

preliminary injunction pending interlocutory appeal pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1), along with 
supporting declarations and a memorandum of law.  (See ECF Nos. 82–85.)  Defendants filed letter 
oppositions on March 30, 2023 (See ECF Nos. 86 and 87.)  Plaintiffs did not file a reply brief by 
the April 7, 2023 due date, nor did they seek an extension to do so.      
                          LEGAL STANDARD                                 
    A party seeking an “order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while 
an appeal is pending” “must ordinarily move first in the district court” for the relief.  Fed. R. App. 
P. 8(a)(1).  “Under Rule 62 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, ‘[w]hile an appeal is pending 
from an interlocutory order ... [that] denies an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, 
or grant an injunction.’”  Dexter 345 Inc. v. Cuomo, No. 11 CIV. 1319, 2011 WL 1795824, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. May 3, 2011), aff’d, 663 F.3d 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(c)).  Courts 
consider four factors in determining whether to grant a stay: “‘(1) whether the stay applicant has 
made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be 

irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other 
parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.’” Nw. Nat. Ins. Co. v. 
Insco, Ltd., 866 F. Supp. 2d 214, 217–18 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 
434 (2009)).                                                              
    “A stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.  It is 
instead an exercise of judicial discretion, and the propriety of its issue is dependent upon the 
circumstances of the particular case.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433 (2009) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). “The party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the 
circumstances justify an exercise of [this] discretion.” Id. at 433–34, 129 S. Ct. 1749. 
                             DISCUSSION                                  

    The  Court  notes  that  Plaintiffs  do  not  characterize  the  instant  motion  as  one  for 
reconsideration,  nor  do  Plaintiffs  provide  any  basis  for  reconsideration  (i.e.  clear  error  or 
intervening law and/or facts.).  United States v. Goode, No. 16CR0052901NSR, 2022 WL 
1567642, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2022) (“Common grounds for reconsideration include “an 
intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a 
clear error or prevent manifest injustice.”) (citing Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 
956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992)); see also Tubo v. Orange Reg’l Med. Ctr., No. 13-CV-1495 
(NSR), 2016 WL 452158, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2016) (“Reconsideration of a Court's previous 
order is “an extraordinary remedy to be employed sparingly in the interests of finality and 
conservation of scarce judicial resources’).  Notably, Plaintiffs’ declarations are the same as those 
previously submitted in support of Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion.  (Compare ECF Nos. 
50–53 and ECF No. 84.)                                                    
    Instead, Plaintiffs explain that they make the instant motion because they plan to apply for 

an injunction before the Second Circuit pending the interlocutory appeal, and Fed. R. App. P. 
8(a)(1) directs Plaintiffs to do so first before the district court.  (See Pls.’ Mem. at 1; Fed. R. App. 
P. 8(a)(1).) The standard for staying a judgment pending appeal “resembles the test for issuance 
of a preliminary injunction.” New York Life Ins. Co. v. Singh, No. 14CV5726NGSMG, 2017 WL 
10187669, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. July 13, 2017) (citing In re Klein Sleep Products, Inc., 1994 WL 
652459 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 18, 1994)).  The Court has already denied Plaintiffs’ third motion 
for a preliminary injunction, and Plaintiffs largely recycle their arguments in the instant motion 
herein.  “When a district court has denied a motion for a preliminary injunction that would change 
the status quo pending a decision on the merits, it is highly unlikely that it will then grant that same 
injunction pending appeal of the denial.” Columbus Ale House, Inc. v. Cuomo, No. 20-CV-4291 

(BMC), 2020 WL 6507326, at *1 n.1 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2020).                
    Nor, as Defendants point out, has Plaintiffs argued that the Court abused its discretion in 
denying in part Plaintiffs’ third motion for a preliminary injunction in the March 13, 2023 Opinion 
and Order.  See Oneida Nation of New York v. Cuomo, 645 F.3d 154, 164 (2d Cir. 2011) (“An 
abuse of discretion occurs if the district court ‘(1) based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law, 
(2) made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or (3) rendered a decision that cannot be 
located within the range of permissible decisions.’”) (citing Lynch v. City of New York, 589 F.3d 
94, 99 (2d Cir. 2009)).                                                   
    Even considering the four factors to obtain a stay pending appeal, the Court finds that 
Plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden for a stay pending appeal.      
    1.  Whether Plaintiffs have made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on 
      the merits                                                         

    Plaintiffs argue that they have standing and have made a strong showing that they are likely 
to succeed on the merits with respect to their challenge against N.Y. Penal Law §§ 400.00(6)1, 
400.00(15)2, 265-e(2)(n)3, and 265-e(2)(t)4.  (Pls.’ Mem.  at 5–10.)    In  doing so, Plaintiffs 
essentially  rehash  their  arguments  previously  raised  on  their  third  motion  for  preliminary 
injunction (compare ECF Nos. 63, 73, and 85), in particular, by arguing that none of the challenged 
laws are grounded in historical tradition or the public’s understanding of the right to bear arms 
when the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791.  (Pls.’ Mem. at 8–9.)        
    For the reasons discussed in the March 13, 2023 Opinion and Order, the Court finds that 
Plaintiffs fail to make a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits with respect 
to their challenge against N.Y.  Penal Law §§ 400.00(6), 400.00(15), 265-e(2)(n), and 265-e(2)(t).  
See Frey, 2023 WL 2473375, at *12–21.                                     
    First, with respect N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(6), Plaintiffs aver that such law has no 
historical analogue.  (Pls.’ Mem. at 9.)  However, as discussed in the Court’s March 13, 2023 


1    In relevant part, N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(6) states that “[a] license to carry or possess a pistol or revolver, 
or to purchase or take possession of a semiautomatic rifle, not otherwise limited as to place or time of possession, 
shall be effective throughout the state, except that the same shall not be valid within the city of New York unless a 
special permit granting validity is issued by the police commissioner of that city.” See N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(6). 

2    N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(15) criminalizes the carrying of firearms outside licensing restrictions. See N.Y. 
Penal Law § 400.00(15).                                                   

3    The Court found that Plaintiffs had standing to challenge N.Y. Penal Law § 265-e(2)(n) insofar as they 
challenged the prohibition against carrying firearms in the Metropolitan Transit Authority subway and train cars.  
See Frey, 2023 WL 2473375, at *9.                                         

4    N.Y. Penal Law § 265-e(2)(t) prohibits the carrying of firearms in the Times Square area.  See N.Y. Penal 
Law § 265-e(2)(t).                                                        
Opinion and Order,  Defendants have  met their burden of showing  a  historical tradition of 
municipal or town level firearm regulations.  See Frey, 2023 WL 2473375, at *12–13. 
    Second, regarding Plaintiffs’ challenge against N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(15), Plaintiffs 
argue that “[n]o discretionary licenses were required to be sought or obtained from the government 

in 1791” and that in 1791, open carry was the means of carrying weapons.  (Pls.’ Mem. at 9.)  As 
articulated already by this Court, and as acknowledged by counsel during the March 10, 2023 oral 
argument on the third preliminary injunction motion, nothing in Bruen indicates that states may 
not impose licensing requirements and restrictions.  See Frey, 2023 WL 2473375, at *12 (citing 
Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2157 (Alito, J., concurring) (the holding “decides nothing about who may 
lawfully possess a firearm or the requirements that must be met to buy a gun . . . . Nor have we 
disturbed anything that we said in [D.C. v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 595, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2799 (2008)] 
or McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010), about restrictions 
that may be imposed on the possession or carrying of guns.”); Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2157 
(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“ the Court's decision does not prohibit ... the imposition of licensing 

requirements for carrying a handgun for self-defense.”).  Moreover, the “Supreme Court has 
already stated that ‘[t]he historical evidence from antebellum America does demonstrate that the 
manner of public carry was subject to reasonable regulation.’” Frey, 2023 WL 2473375, at *14 
(citing Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2150) (emphasis in original).                
    Finally, regarding N.Y. Penal Law §§ 265-e(2)(n) and 265-e(2)(t), Plaintiffs argue that 
such prohibitions are not grounded in historical tradition.  (Pls.’ Mem. at 9–10.)  The Court refers 
to its extensive discussion in the March 13, 2023 Opinion and Order finding that Defendants met 
their burden of establishing a historical tradition of regulation and/or prohibition of guns in 
analogous locations, and that therefore, Plaintiffs did not show a likelihood of success with respect 
to their challenge against N.Y. Penal Law §§ 265-e(2)(n) and 265-e(2)(t).  Frey, 2023 WL 
2473375, at *16–21.                                                       
    2.  Whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay  
    Plaintiffs aver that they will face irreparable harm because they will be subjected to 

enforcement action for carrying guns in ways that are currently prohibited under the statutes they 
are challenging.  (See Pls.’ Mem. at 11–13.)                              
    As discussed in the Court’s March 13, 2023 Opinion and Order, “[the] presumption of 
irreparable harm arising from a constitutional deprivation is not automatic.” Frey, 2023 WL 
2473375, at *2 (citing Joglo Realties, Inc. v. Seggos, 16-CV-1666 (ARR)(CLP), 2016 WL 
4491409, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2016)).  As stated therein, “[b]ecause the violation of a 
constitutional right is the irreparable harm asserted [ ], the two prongs of the preliminary injunction 
threshold merge into one” and “in order to show irreparable injury, plaintiff must show a likelihood 
of success on the merits.” (Id.) (citing Turley v. Giuliani, 86 F. Supp. 2d 291, 295 (S.D.N.Y. 
2000)).                                                                   

    Because the Court finds, for the reasons stated in the March 13, 2023 Opinion and Order 
and discussed briefly above, that Plaintiffs either do not have standing or do not show a likelihood 
of success on the merits, the Court therefore does not find irreparable harm.   
    3.  Whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties’ interests 
      in the proceeding and balancing the public interest                

    Plaintiffs argue that because Bruen rejected “balancing” the government’s interests against 
individual rights to bear arms, that the Court should therefore not consider the government’s 
interest at all when issuing an injunction.  (See Pls.’ Mem. at 13.). The Court notes that Plaintiff 
conflates the Bruen standard, which is used to evaluate whether a law violates the Second 
Amendment, and the preliminary injunction standard, which has remained unchanged and is well 
settled.  Mullins v.  City of New  York, 626 F.3d 47, 52-53  (2d Cir. 2010) (A party seeking a 
preliminary injunction “must demonstrate that it will suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive 
relief and either (1) that it is likely to succeed on the merits of the action, or (2) that there are 
sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a  fair ground for litigation, provided 
that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in favor of the moving party.”). In other words, while 
Bruen did away with means-end scrutiny when considering whether a law violates the Second 
Amendment, see Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2131, the Court must still consider the parties’ hardships and 
the public interest when deciding on whether to issue an injunction. 
      Plaintiffs also argue that because it is challenging laws that allegedly violate individual 
Second Amendment rights, that the balance of hardships necessarily falls in Plaintiffs’ favor.  (Pls.’ 
Mem.  at  14-15.)  This argument puts the “cart before the horse,” as the saying goes, because 
Plaintiffs presume that the laws have indeed violated the Second Amendment.  However, as stated 
in the March 13, 2023 Opinion and Order, “because Plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success 
of the merits with respect to the aforementioned statutes, Plaintiffs therefore cannot show that the 
balance of hardships tips in their interest.”  Frey, 2023 WL 2473375, at *21. 
                                   CONCLUSION 
      For the reasons discussed herein, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay pending 
appeal.  The Clerk of the Court is kindly directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 82.

NELSON S. ROMAN, United States District Judge: 
      Plaintiffs  Jason Frey, Brianna Frey, Jack Cheng, and William Sappe (“Plaintiffs”) bring 
this action against the Acting  Superintendent of the New York State Police, Kevin P.  Bruen 
(“Superintendent”),  New  York  City,  and  the  NYPD  Police  Commissioner  (together, 
“Defendants”), alleging various violations of the Second Amendment.  (ECF No.  1.)  Presently 
before the Court is Defendant Bruen’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
(ECF No. 31.)  For the following reasons, Defendant Bruen’s motion is GRANTED. 
                               BACKGROUND 
      The Court assumes familiarity with the underlying facts and allegations in this case, as set 
forth in this Court’s previous Opinion and Order.  See Frey v. Bruen, No. 21 CV 05334 (NSR), 
2022 WL 522478, at *1-3 (S.D.N.Y. February 22, 2022). 
                             LEGAL STANDARD 
      A claim is  subject to  dismissal under Rule  12(b)(1)  if the  court  lacks  subject matter 
jurisdiction to adjudicate it pursuant to statute or constitutional authority.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(1); Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2000).  Without jurisdiction, the

Court lacks the “power to adjudicate the merits of the case.”  Carter v. HealthPort Techs., LLC, 
822 F.3d 47, 55 (2d Cir. 2016).  It is well-settled that the party invoking the Court’s jurisdiction 
“bears the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”  
Aurecchione v. Schoolman Transp. Sys., Inc., 426 F.3d 635, 638 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Luckett v. 

Bure, 290 F.3d 493, 497 (2d Cir. 2002)).  A plaintiff’s lack of standing is grounds for dismissal 
under Rule 12(b)(1).  Buonasera v. Honest Co., 208 F. Supp. 3d 555, 560 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). 
                          DISCUSSION                                     
I.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Against Defendant Bruen are Dismissed for Lack of Standing   
    Defendant Bruen avers that the claims raised against him in the Complaint should be 
dismissed due to Plaintiffs’ lack of standing.  (Memorandum of Law in Support of Superintendent 
Bruen’s Motion to Dismiss (“Bruen Motion”) ECF No. 32 at 7–11.)  The only claims raised against 
Bruen are in Counts I, III, and IV.1  (Complaint. ¶¶ 233–35; 241–44; 245–48)   The Court 
previously addressed Plaintiffs’ standing to raise these claims in its Opinion and Order dated 
February 22, 2022.  See Frey, 2022 WL 522478, at *4–6.  For the same reasons explained therein, 

the Court holds that Plaintiffs have failed to show an injury in fact, and therefore lack standing.  
Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ Counts I, III, and IV are dismissed as to Defendant Bruen.   
    Defendants New York City and NYPD Commissioner did not file a separate motion to 
dismiss nor did they join Defendant Bruen’s motion, and instead they filed an answer.  (ECF No. 
28.)  However, the same claims raised against Bruen are also raised against these Defendants.  
(Complaint ¶¶ 233–35; 241–44; 245–48.)  Therefore, the Court also dismisses Counts I, III, and 


1    Plaintiffs clarify that Count II is not against Defendant Bruen.  (Plaintiffs’ Memorandum of Law in 
Opposition to Defendant Bruen’s Motion to Dismiss) (“Plaintiffs’ Opposition) ECF No. 33 at 2 n.3) (“To the extent 
that the Complaint complains of the discretionary provisions of Penal Law § 400.00(1)(b) and (n), the challenge is on 
the context of William Sappe’s challenge to 38 RCNY 5, not Defendant Bruen.”).  Plaintiffs’ Count V, which 
challenges provisions in the New York City licensing scheme, is raised only against New York City.  (Complaint ¶¶ 
249–52).                                                                  
IV against New York City and the NYPD Commissioner, sua sponte.  Fischer v. Cruz, No. 16-
CV-1224(JS)(ARL), 2016 WL 1383493, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2016) (“Because the standing 
issue goes to this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, it can be raised sua sponte.”) (citing Plante v. 
Dake, 621 F. App’x 67, 69 (2d Cir. 2015)).                                

    Therefore, the only remaining claims to this action are: (i) Count II, which challenges 
discretionary  standards  used  when  issuing  handgun  licenses  in  New  York  Penal  Law  §§ 
400.00(1)(b) and (n) and 38 RCNY 5-10 (a), (h), and (n); and (ii) Count V, which raises a Monell 
claim against New York City to enjoin 38 RCNY 5-10 (a), (h), and (n) as violating the Second 
Amendment.  (Complaint ¶¶ 237–40, 249–52).  Because these claims were not addressed in the 
Court’s previous Opinion and Order and the remaining Defendants did not move to dismiss these 
claims, Counts II and V remain pending.  See generally, Frey, 2022 WL 522478. 
II.  Whether Plaintiffs’ Claims are Mooted by New York State Rifle & Pistol Association 
    Inc. v. Bruen                                                        

    While Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Bruen are dismissed for lack of standing, the 
Court will nonetheless assess the extent to which Plaintiffs’ claims are mooted by the U.S. 
Supreme Court’s recent decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, 142 
S.Ct. 2111 (2022), which was decided while Defendant Bruen’s motion to dismiss was pending.  
Under the “case or controversy” requirement of Article III of the Constitution, “at all times, the 
dispute before the court must be real and live, not feigned, academic, or conjectural.” Russman v. 
Bd. of Educ. of Enlarged City Sch. Dist. of City of Watervliet, 260 F.3d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 2001).  
A case is moot, and therefore no longer a case or controversy for the purposes of Article III, “when 
the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the 
outcome.” Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91, 133 S.Ct. 721, 184 L.Ed.2d 553 (2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  When a case becomes moot, a district court no longer has 
subject matter jurisdiction, see Fox v. Bd. of Trs. of State Univ. of N.Y., 42 F.3d 135, 140 (2d Cir. 
1994), and courts may consider whether they have subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte at any 
stage of the litigation.  See Fed. Dep. Ins. Corp. v. Four Star Holding Co., 178 F.3d 97, 100 n.2 
(2d Cir. 1999).                                                           

    In Bruen, the U.S. Supreme held that the “proper cause” standard under N.Y. Penal Law 
400.00(2)(f) violated the Second and Fourteen Amendment rights of individuals who were denied 
concealed carry licenses in New York State for failing to meet that standard.  The Court found that 
the “proper cause” standard, which bars individuals from obtaining concealed carry licenses unless 
they could demonstrate “a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the general 
community,” id. at 2123, “prevents law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from 
exercising their right to keep and bear arms.”  Id. at. 2156; see also id. at 2162 (Kavanaugh, J., 
concurring) (“As the Court explains, New York's outlier may-issue regime is constitutionally 
problematic because it grants open-ended discretion to licensing officials and authorizes licenses 
only for those applicants who can show some special need apart from self-defense”).   

    The Court also announced a new standard of review when evaluating whether a regulation 
violates the Second Amendment, and expressly rejected the previous approach widely used by 
federal courts.2  See id. at 2126.  Finding that the second step was inconsistent with the principles 
articulated in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 635 (2008) and McDonald v. City of 
Chicago, Ill., 561 U.S. 742 (2010), the Court pronounced a new standard consistent with the 


2    The prior approach was as follows: “[f]or the first step, the Court analyzes whether the challenged legislation 
impinges upon conduct protected by the Second Amendment, or weapons in common use and typically possessed by 
law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes. For the second step, the Court utilizes two factors to determine the 
appropriate level of scrutiny: (1) how close the law comes to the core of the Second Amendment right and (2) the 
severity of the law's burden on the right. If the challenged legislation does not implicate the core or substantially 
burden the right, then heightened scrutiny does not apply.”   Frey, 2022 WL 522478, at *7 (internal quotations and 
citations omitted).                                                       
approach used in Heller: (i) “[w]hen the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's 
conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct”; and (ii) “[t]he government must 
then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition 
of firearm regulation.”  Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2129–30.                    

    For the reasons discussed below, Bruen does not fully moot Plaintiffs’ claims.  
    Count 1: Criminalization of Mere Possession of Handguns              
    Plaintiffs’ first count seeks to enjoin the criminalization of “mere possession” of a handgun 
under Penal Law §§ 265.01(1), 265.01-b, 265.03(2), 265.03(3), and 400.00(15) as violating the 
Second Amendment. (Complaint ¶¶ 234–36.)                                  
    The Supreme Court made clear that the Second Amendment protects law abiding citizens’ 
right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside of the home, but the Supreme Court did not 
indicate that such right is unfettered.  Rather, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that states may impose 
gun regulations and licensing requirements as long as those regulations and requirements are 
consistent with historical tradition.  See Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2126 (“the government must 

demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation's historical tradition of firearm 
regulation”); id. at 2138 n.9 (“To be clear, nothing in our analysis should be interpreted to suggest 
the unconstitutionality of the 43 States’ ‘shall-issue’ licensing regimes, under which ‘a general 
desire  for  self-defense  is  sufficient  to  obtain  a  [permit].’”);  id.  at  2121  (Kavanaugh,  J., 
concurrence)  (“[T]he  Court's  decision  does  not  prohibit  States  from  imposing  licensing 
requirements for carrying a handgun for self-defense.”).  While the Bruen decision held that the 
“proper cause” standard violated the Second Amendment, it did not go as far as stating that the 
criminalization  of  “mere  possession”  of  handguns  under  New  York  penal  law  was 
unconstitutional.  Plaintiffs are still required under New York law to have a valid license before 
possessing handguns, which Bruen does not call into question.             
    Notably, Plaintiffs Brianna Frey and Jason Frey, who have New York State restricted 
handgun licenses (limited to sporting activities), were denied unrestricted concealed carry licenses 

for failing to meet the “proper clause” standard, and Plaintiff Jack Cheng, who also has a New 
York State restricted handgun license (limited to target shooting activities), wishes to have a 
concealed carry license without needing to show “proper clause.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 93–94, 97–100, 126, 
128–130, 165, 175).  Because Bruen has now struck down the “proper cause” standard, Plaintiffs’ 
claim is mooted to the extent that they wish to carry concealed handguns.3   
    To  the  extent  that  Plaintiffs  seek  to  enjoin  criminalization  of  “mere  possession”  of 
handguns when doing so in New York City (given that none of the Plaintiffs have valid New York 
City handgun licenses, which has its own licensing scheme) or in an open manner, their claim is 
not mooted for the reasons articulated below.  See infra.                 
    Count 2: Discretionary and Permissive Licensing Scheme               

    Plaintiffs’  second  count,  which  is  raised  against  New  York  City  and  the  NYPD 
Commissioner, challenges the discretion provided to licensing officers in allowing them to 
determine whether to grant a handgun license based on “good moral character,” lack of good cause 
for denial, and other discretionary standards under New York Penal Law §§ 400.00(1)(b) and (n) 

3    However, the Court takes judicial notice of the New York State website, which indicates that Plaintiffs may 
have to first reapply for an unrestricted carry license.  See Apply for a Firearms License, New York State, available 
at https://www.ny.gov/services/how-obtain-firearms-license (last visited Aug. 23, 2022) (“Nothing in the Supreme 
Court decision allows anyone to immediately legally carry a concealed firearm in New York State without obtaining 
the currently-required permits or licenses.”); see id. (“This also means you cannot legally carry a concealed firearm 
outside of your home in New York State if you only have a license to possess a gun in your home.”); see also Lewis 
v. M&T Bank, No. 21-933, 2022 WL 775758, at *2 (2d Cir. Mar. 15, 2022) (indicating that courts “regularly take 
judicial notice of agency documents on official websites.”).              
and 38 RCNY 5-10 (a), (h), and (n).  (Complaint ¶¶ 210–14, 238–40.)  While the Bruen decision 
struck down the “proper cause” standard as unconstitutional, the Court did not opine on the 
constitutionality of other standards considered by licensing officers when determining whether to 
grant a handgun license.  See Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2156.   Therefore, Plaintiffs’ second count is not 

mooted by the Bruen decision.                                             
    Count 3: Geographical Ban                                            
    Plaintiffs also seek to enjoin the enforcement of N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(6), which makes 
a handgun license issued by New York State ineffective in New York City unless a special permit 
is granted by the New York City Police Commissioner validating that license.  See N.Y. Penal 
Law § 400.00(6).  Plaintiffs call this rule a “geographical ban,” and argue that they have a 
preexisting right to possess handguns throughout the State.  (Complaint ¶¶ 242–44.)  Bruen did 
not address the constitutionality of laws requiring separate licensing requirements between a State 
and a municipality within that State.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ third claim is not mooted by the Bruen 
decision.                                                                 

    Count 4: Open Carry Ban Challenge                                    
    Under Plaintiffs’ fourth count, Plaintiffs challenge New York’s open carry ban as violating 
the Second Amendment and seek to enjoin the enforcement of Penal Law §§ 265.01(1), 265.01-b, 
265.03(2), 265.03(3), 400.00(6), and 400.00(15) with respect to open carriage of a handgun in 
public. (Complaint ¶¶ 245–48.)  The Bruen decision did not address the constitutionality of New 
York’s open carry ban.  Rather, the appellants in Bruen were only contesting the constitutionality 
of New York’s concealed carry licensing requirements and did not address New York’s open carry 
ban.  See Bruen, 142 S. Ct. at 2122–24; see also id. at 2187 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Court 
does not say whether the result in this case would be different if New York allowed open carriage 
by law-abiding citizens as a matter of course.”).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ fourth count is not mooted.   
    Count 5: Monell claim against New York City                          
     Plaintiffs’  fifth  count  raises  a  Monell  claim  against  New  York  City  to  enjoin  the 

enforcement of 38 RCNY 5-10 (a), (h), and (n) as violating the Second Amendment.  (Complaint 
¶¶ 249–52.)  See 38 RCNY 5-10 (a) (denying handgun license for applicants that have been 
arrested, indicted or convicted for a crime or violation except minor traffic violations, in any 
federal, state or local jurisdiction); 38 RCNY 5-10 (h) (denying handgun license for applicants 
with poor driving history, multiple driver license suspensions or that have been declared a scofflaw 
by the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles); 38 RCNY 5-10 (n) (denying handgun 
license for applicants based on other information demonstrating an unwillingness to abide by the 
law or for other good cause).  Defendant New York City did not file a separate motion to dismiss 
nor did it join Defendant Bruen’s motion, and instead filed an answer.  (ECF No. 28.)  Because 
the Monell claim is not asserted against Defendant Bruen, this claim remains pending.  In any 

event, the Bruen decision did not opine on these provisions in the New York City licensing scheme, 
so this claim is not mooted.                                              
                          CONCLUSION                                     
    For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Bruen’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED.  Counts I, 
III, and IV are dismissed without prejudice.  Plaintiffs have until October 3, 2022 to file an 
Amended Complaint as to any claims that have not been dismissed with prejudice.  Defendants 
are then directed to answer or otherwise respond by October 24, 2022.  If Plaintiffs fail to file an 
Amended Complaint within the time allowed, and they cannot show good cause to excuse such 
failure, those claims dismissed without prejudice by this order will be deemed dismissed with 
prejudice. 
     The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 31.4 

Dated: September 1, 2022                           SO ORDERED:

KEVIN P. BRUEN, Acting Superintendent of the             OPINION & ORDER 
New York State Police, in his official capacity, NEW 
YORK CITY, New York, and DERMOT SHEA, in 
his official capacity as NYPD Police Commissioner, 
                        Defendants. 

NELSON S. ROMAN, United States District Judge: 
      Plaintiffs  Jason Frey, Brianna Frey, Jack Cheng, and William Sappe (“Plaintiffs”) bring 
this  action  against New York  City,  the New York Police  Department  Police  Commissioner 
(together the “City Defendants”), and the Acting Superintendent of the New York State Police (the 
“Superintendent,” together “Defendants”), alleging various violations of the Second Amendment. 
(ECF No. 1.)  Presently before the Court is Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  (ECF 
No. 20.)  For the following reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion is DENIED. 
                               BACKGROUND 
          New York State Firearms Laws 
     New York State “maintains a general prohibition on the possession of ‘firearms’ absent a 
license.”  Kachalsky v. County of Westchester, 701 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 2012).  New York Penal 
Law Section 400.00 contains “the exclusive statutory mechanism for the licensing of firearms in 
New York State.”  /d. (citing O’Connor v. Scarpino, 83 N.Y.2d 919, 920 (1994)).  The New York 
Penal Laws also include misdemeanor and felony violations for the illegal carrying of firearms 
without a license.  See, e.g., N.Y. Penal Law §§ 265.01(1); 265.01-b; 265.03(3).

    Under  Section  400.00,  a  licensing  officer  can  issue  a  firearm  license  “only  after 
investigation and finding that all statements in a proper application for a license are true.”  N.Y. 
Penal Law § 400.00(1).  The statute requires that an applicant (i) be at least 21 years of age; (ii) 
lack a history of crime and mental illness; (iii) be of good moral character; and (iv) be someone 

for “whom no good cause exists for the denial of the license.”  N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(1)(a)-(d), 
(n).  New York State residents may apply for “[a] license for a pistol or revolver” to “have and 
possess in [a] dwelling by a householder” or “have and carry concealed . . . by any person when 
proper cause exists for the issuance thereof.”  N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(2).  The Second Circuit 
has interpreted “proper cause” to include “carrying a handgun for target practice, hunting, or self-
defense” and a licensing offer may restrict a license “to the purposes that justified the issuance.”  
Kachalsky, 701 F.3d at 86 (citing O’Connor, 83 N.Y.2d at 921).            
    To establish the proper cause needed to obtain an unrestricted concealed carry license, the 
applicant must “demonstrate a special need for self-protection distinguishable from that of the 
general community or of persons engaged in the same profession.”  Id. (quoting Klenosky v. N.Y 

City Police Dep’t, 75 A.D.2d 793, 793 (1st Dep’t 1980)).  This standard does not include “[a] 
generalized desire to carry a concealed weapon to protect one’s person and property” or “living or 
being employed in a high crime area.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  If 
denied a license, an applicant may challenge the decision in New York State court under Article 
78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.  Kachalsky, 701 F.3d at 87.  
    Pursuant to Section 400.00(15), any violation of a provision of this section is a class A 
misdemeanor.  N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(15).  New York State does not permit the open carry of 
handguns.  Kachalsky, 701 F.3d at 86.                                     
 II.  New York City Firearms Laws                                        
    New York City has its own regulatory licensing scheme.  For New York City, an applicant 
must apply to the New York Police Department (“NYPD”) License Division.  38 RCNY § 5-05.  
There are various types of handgun licenses issued by the NYPD.  38 RCNY § 5-01.  One such 
license is a special license, which is issued to persons in possession of a valid New York State 

County License.  38 RCNY § 5-01(e).  To be eligible for a carry or special license, an applicant 
must meet the requirements for a premises license, and must also show “proper cause” pursuant to 
Section 400.00(2)(f), which is “determined by a review of all relevant information bearing on the 
claimed need of the applicant for the license.”  38 RCNY § 5-03.          
    If a license application is denied, the applicant may appeal to the Division Head, License 
Division.  38 RCNY § 5-07(e)-(f).  If the appeal is denied, the applicant shall receive a “Notice of 
Disapproval After Appeal,” which concludes the NYPD’s administrative review procedure.  38 
RCNY § 5-07(f).                                                           
 III.  The Plaintiffs                                                    
    Plaintiffs are residents of New York State who possess various kinds of New York State 

pistol licenses.  (Compl. ¶¶ 92; 125; 164; 196.)  Jason Frey was issued a New York State pistol 
license by Westchester County.  (Id. ¶ 92.)  The license is restricted to “sportsman” which means 
he may only carry it inside his home, to and from target shooting, and during sports activities.  (Id. 
¶¶ 93-94.)  In 2019, Mr. Frey filed an application with Westchester to remove the restrictions from 
his license to allow unrestricted concealed carry for self-defense based on a physical and verbal 
attack in June of 2018.  (Id. ¶¶ 95-96.)  The application was denied, as he failed to meet the “proper 
cause” standard because his concern about being a potential target of violence was “entirely 
speculative.”  (Id. ¶¶ 97-100.)  Mr. Frey did not file an Article 78 proceeding as it would be “futile.”  
(Id. ¶ 102.)  He seeks to carry his handgun both openly and concealed in New York State and New 
York City without restriction and without having to demonstrate proper cause.  (Id. ¶¶ 105-107.)  
He has never applied to the NYPD Licensing Division for a New York City license, as that would 
be “futile.”  (Id. ¶ 111.)                                                
    Brianna Frey was issued a New York State handgun license by Westchester County.  (Id. 

¶ 125.)  The license is restricted to possession of her handguns inside of her home, to and from 
target shooting, and during sporting activities.  (Id. ¶ 126.)  In 2019, Mrs. Frey filed an application 
with Westchester to remove the restrictions from her license to allow unrestricted concealed carry 
based on a physical and verbal attack in June of 2018.  (Id. ¶¶ 127; 131.)  The application was 
denied, as she failed to meet the “proper cause” standard.  (Id. at ¶¶ 128-130.)  Mrs. Frey did not 
file an Article 78 proceeding as it would be “futile.”  (Id. ¶¶ 135-138.)  She seeks to carry her 
handgun openly and concealed in New York State and New York City without restriction and 
without having to demonstrate proper cause.  (Id. ¶¶ 139-144.)  She has never applied to the NYPD 
Licensing Division for a New York City license, as that would be “futile.”  (Id. ¶ 153.)   
    Jack Cheng was issued a New York State handgun license by Nassau County.  (Id. ¶ 164.)  

The license is restricted to possession of his handguns inside of his home, to and from target 
shooting activities, and while engaged in hunting during hunting season.  (Id. ¶ 165.)  The NYPD 
License Division issued him a concealed carry license related to his businesses in New York City 
over 15 years ago.  (Id. ¶ 169.)  The New York City license expired in 2019.  (Id. ¶ 170.)  Cheng 
submitted a recertification application in 2019, which was denied.  (Id. ¶¶ 172-173.)  In March of 
2021, Cheng commenced an Article 78 proceeding in state court challenging the denial of the 
application, but his petition was denied.  See Cheng v. Shea, Index No. 152437/2021, Kotler, J. 
(Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. 2021).  Cheng commenced a second proceeding seeking an order of mandamus 
compelling renewal of his license, which was also denied.  See Cheng v. Shea, Index No. 
154521/2021, Love, J. (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. 2021).  Cheng seeks to carry his handgun openly in New 
York State and New York City without restriction and without having to demonstrate proper cause.  
(Compl. ¶¶ 175-176.)                                                      
    William Sappe was issued a New York State handgun license by Orange County.  (Id. ¶ 

196.)  The license is an unrestricted concealed carry handgun license.  (Id.)  In 2018, Sappe applied 
to the NYPD License Division for a New York City special carry license.  (Id. ¶ 201.)  The 
application was denied as he failed to establish “proper cause” and lacked good “moral character.”  
(Id. ¶¶ 202-205.)  Sappe challenged the denial of his application in an Article 78 proceeding in 
2020.  (Id. ¶ 212.)  The court denied the petition based on “an unwillingness to abide by the law, 
a lack of candor towards lawful authorities, a lack of concern for the safety of oneself and/or other 
persons and/or for public safety, and/or other good cause for the denial of the license.”  (Id. ¶ 213.)1  
Sappe seeks to carry a firearm both openly and concealed in New York State and New York City 
without demonstrating proper cause.  (Id. ¶¶ 214-217.)                    
    Plaintiffs do not carry their handguns open and exposed in New York State, and Sappe 

does not carry his handgun concealed into New York City, out of fear of criminal prosecution, the 
revocation of their handgun licenses, the seizure of their firearms, and the forfeiture of their right 
to possess firearms in the future.  (Id. ¶¶ 116; 147; 187; 228-229.)  Each Plaintiff intends to violate 
the limitations of their handgun licenses.  (Id. ¶¶ 106; 140; 176; 217.)   
    Plaintiffs initiated this action on June 16, 2021.  (ECF No. 1.)  On September 21, 2021, 
Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.  (ECF No. 20.)  Both the Superintendent and 


    1 While not discussed fully in this Opinion, the Court notes that neither Sappe nor Cheng brought 
constitutional challenges during their Article 78 proceedings, and therefore their claims are likely barred.  See Miller 
v. City of N.Y., No. 17 CV 4198 (RJD), 2019 WL 2164100, at *2 (May 10, 2019) (holding the plaintiff’s Section 
1983 claims were barred by res judicata as his “constitutional claims seeking declaratory relief” arose out of the 
“same transaction or series of transactions as those at issue in his Article 78 proceeding” and therefore could have 
been raised in his Article 78 proceeding).                                
the City Defendants filed oppositions.  (ECF Nos. 23 & 26.)  On February 1, 2022, the Court held 
oral argument.                                                            
                        LEGAL STANDARD                                   
    Injunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear 

showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 
U.S. 7, 22 (2008).  A party seeking a preliminary injunction “must demonstrate that it will suffer 
irreparable harm absent injunctive relief and either (1) that it is likely to succeed on the merits of 
the action, or (2) that there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a 
fair ground for litigation, provided that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in favor of the 
moving party.”  Mullins v. City of New York, 626 F.3d 47, 52–53 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing Citigroup 
Global Mkts., Inc. v. VCG Special Opportunities Master Fund Ltd., 598 F.3d 30, 34–35 (2d Cir. 
2010)).                                                                   
    Where “a party seeks an injunction that will affect governmental action taken in the public 
interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme, the plaintiff must typically show a likelihood 

of success on the merits—a serious question going to the merits is usually insufficient[.]”  Mullins, 
626 F.3d at 53.  However, where a party seeks a mandatory injunction “altering, rather than 
maintaining, the status quo,” such as in this case, that party “must meet [a] more rigorous 
standard.”  Almontaser v. N. Y. City Dep’t of Educ., 519 F.3d 505, 508 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal 
alterations omitted); see also Tom Doherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm’t, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 33 (2d 
Cir. 1995) (“[W]e have required the movant to meet a higher standard where . . . an injunction will 
alter, rather than maintain, the status quo . . . .”).  The moving party must establish “a clear showing 
that the moving party is entitled to the relief requested,” or show that “extreme or very serious 
damage” would result in the absence of preliminary relief.  Tom Doherty Assocs., 60 F.3d at 34. 
                          DISCUSSION                                     
    Plaintiffs are requesting a preliminary injunction that will temporarily enjoin Defendants 

from enforcing Penal Law Sections 265.01(1), 265.01-b, 265.03(3), and 400.00(15) against those 
who (i) possess a valid New York State handgun license and who carry a handgun open and 
exposed on their person, and (ii) possess a valid unrestricted New York State concealed carry 
handgun license who carry a handgun concealed on their person within New York City.  (Plaintiffs’ 
Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Mem.”) ECF No. 20 at 
2-3.)  Defendants allege that Plaintiffs do not have standing to assert their claims and have failed 
to satisfy their burden for a preliminary injunction.  The Court will first examine Plaintiffs’ 
standing, and then will discuss the merits of Plaintiffs’ injunctive request. 
 I.   Standing                                                           
    The Supreme Court has called the doctrine of standing “perhaps the most important” of the 

case-or-controversy doctrines.  Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750 (1984).  The doctrine requires 
a plaintiff to have a “personal stake,” in the outcome of the action.  Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 
555 U.S. 488, 493 (2009).  That is, a plaintiff must allege a “personal injury fairly traceable to the 
defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.”  Allen, 
468 U.S. at 751.                                                          
    “[T]he ‘irreducible constitutional minimum’ of standing consists of three elements[:]  [t]he 
plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged 
conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  
Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 
560–61 (1992)).  The party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing 
each element.  Id. at 561.                                                
    To have standing to seek injunctive relief, a plaintiff must establish a “real or immediate 
threat” of injury.  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983); see also Nicosia v. 

Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 239 (2d Cir. 2016) (“Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue injunctive 
relief where they are unable to establish a ‘real or immediate threat’ of injury.”).  Mere “allegations 
of possible future injury are not sufficient”; the “injury must be certainly impending.”  Izquierdo 
v. Panera Bread Co., 450 F.Supp.3d 453, 460 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (quoting Daniel v. Tootsie Roll 
Indus., LLC, No. 17 CIV. 7541 (NRB), 2018 WL 3650015, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 1, 2018)).   
      a.  Injury in Fact                                                 
    The Superintendent first alleges that Plaintiffs have failed to show an injury in fact as they 
have failed to show a credible threat of imminent prosecution.  (State Defendant Superintendent 
Kevin P. Bruen’s Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary 
Injunction (“Superintendent Opp.”) ECF No. 23 at 15-20.)  In response, Plaintiffs argue that they 

have demonstrated their intention to openly carry their handguns throughout New York State, 
which would create a credible threat of prosecution.  (Plaintiffs’ Reply to State Defendant in 
Further Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Superintendent Reply”) ECF No. 24 at 1.)   
    “[P]re-enforcement review is available where the ‘circumstances . . . render the threatened 
enforcement sufficiently imminent’” which can be established “by plausible allegations that a 
plaintiff intends to engage in conduct proscribed by a statute, and ‘there exists a credible threat of 
prosecution thereunder.’”  Adam v. Barr, 792 F. App’x 20, 21–22 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting Susan 
B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 159–60 (2014)).  A credible threat of prosecution 
cannot be “imaginary or speculative,” Knife Rights, Inc. v. Vance, 802 F.3d 377, 384 (2d Cir. 2015) 
(quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat’l Union, 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)), and it “will not 
be found where ‘plaintiffs do not claim that they have ever been threatened with prosecution, that 
a prosecution is likely, or even that a prosecution is remotely possible.’”  Cayuga Nation v. Tanner, 
824 F.3d 321, 331 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Knife Rights, 802 F.3d at 377).   

    Here, Plaintiffs’ Complaint alleges that they “intend[] to” carry their handguns on their 
person in public throughout the state.  (Compl. ¶¶ 72; 106; 140; 144; 176; 178; 217.)  In addition, 
the Freys signed sworn declarations that state they “intend to carry [their] handgun[s] on [their] 
person in public for all lawful purposes.”  (Declaration of Amy L. Bellantoni (“Bellantoni Decl.”) 
ECF No. 22 at Ex. 1.)  These allegations are insufficient.                
    First, Plaintiffs have not alleged concrete plans to violate the New York Penal Laws.  While 
Plaintiffs state they “intend to” violate their license limitations, such “‘some day’ intentions—
without any description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the some day 
will be—do not support a finding of the ‘actual or imminent’ injury” that is required.  Lujan, 504 
U.S. at 564; see also San Diego Cty. Gun Rights Comm. v. Reno, 98 F.3d 1121, 1127 (9th Cir. 

1996)  (holding  the  plaintiffs’  assertions  that  they  “wish  and  intend  to  engage  in  activities 
prohibited” by the Crime Control Act, which prohibited the manufacture, transfer or possession of 
semiautomatic  assault  weapons,  was  insufficient  to  establish  a  genuine  threat  of  imminent 
prosecution).                                                             
    Second, Plaintiffs do not allege a credible threat of prosecution.  Instead, Plaintiffs infer 
that because the Penal Laws exist, they will be prosecuted once they carry their firearms outside 
the confines of their licenses.  A similar challenge was held to be insufficient in Sibley v. Watches, 
501 F. Supp. 3d 210, 218 (W.D.N.Y. 2020).  In Sibley, the plaintiff brought a challenge to the 
constitutionality of New York’s law banning the possession of cane swords.  Id. at 221 (citing 
N.Y. Penal Law § 265.01(1)).  The defendant moved to dismiss for lack of standing, which the 
Court granted.  Id. at 222–23.  The plaintiff lacked standing in part because he did not allege a 
credible threat of prosecution.  Id. (citing Adam, 792 F. App’x at 22 (“the mere existence of a law 
prohibiting intended conduct does not automatically confer Article III standing”)).  The court held 

that his “assertion of standing rest[ed] on the mere existence” of the statute, and he did “not allege 
that the statute ha[d] been enforced against him in the past or that anyone threatened him with 
prosecution.”  Id. at 223.  Similarly, here, Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts showing that they 
have been prosecuted in the past or have been threatened with enforcement of any of the statutes 
they are challenging.  Therefore, they have failed to show an injury in fact sufficient for standing. 
    Plaintiffs aver that a credible threat of prosecution exists as the Superintendent has not 
stated the criminal statutes will not be enforced against Plaintiffs.  (Superintendent Reply at 1-2.)  
However, the Superintendent is not required to make this disavowal, as he has not previously 
threatened or charged Plaintiffs under the relevant statutes.  See Cayuga Nation, 824 F.3d at 331 
(holding  the  plaintiffs  demonstrated  a  credible  threat  of  prosecution  where  the  defendants 

previously announced their intention to enforce an ordinance against them, and previously warned 
plaintiffs that failure to comply may constitute an offense punishable by fine or imprisonment or 
both); Knife Rights, 802 F.3d at 386 (holding the plaintiffs’ fear of being charged under the statute 
for criminal possession of a weapon was “not conjectural or hypothetical” as “[e]ach man ha[d] 
already been charged with a § 265.01(1) violation for carrying a common folding knife” and was 
“obliged to retain counsel to secure an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal”). 
    In addition, the Superintendent argues that Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge New York 
Penal  Law  Sections  265.01(1),  265.01-b,  265.03(2),  and  265.03(3)  specifically  because,  as 
licensed firearm owners, they are exempted from these criminal penalties.  (Superintendent Opp. 
at  16-17.)    Section  265.20(a)(3)  explicitly  states  that  these  Sections  “shall  not  apply”  to 
“[p]ossession of a pistol or revolver by a person to whom a license therefor has been issued as 
provided under section 400.00 or 400.01[.]”  N.Y. Penal Law § 265.20(a)(3).  In addition, Section 
400.00(17) states:                                                        

    [t]he provisions of article two hundred sixty-five of this chapter relating to illegal 
    possession of a firearm, shall not apply to an offense which also constitutes a 
    violation of this section by a person holding an otherwise valid license under the 
    provisions of this section and such offense shall only be punishable as a class A 
    misdemeanor pursuant to this section.                                

N.Y. Penal Law § 400.00(17).  As each Plaintiff has been issued such a license, they do not and 
will not face criminal liability under Section 265.                       
    Plaintiffs argue that they intend to carry their weapons openly, and open carry is not an 
exception  to  the  criminal  statutes  because  it  is  not  within  the  scope  of  Section  400.00.  
(Superintendent Reply at 2.)  The Court is not convinced.  The plain language of the statute 
explicitly states that the relevant Sections will not apply to persons such as Plaintiffs.  Instead, if 
Plaintiffs were to carry their weapons openly, they would at best be committing a violation of their 
handgun license restrictions, and subject to potential penalties under Section 400.00(15).  Plaintiffs 
have failed to proffer any evidence indicating that they may be prosecuted specifically under 
Section 265 for openly carrying their weapons.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have failed to show a credible 
threat of prosecution under Section 265, and therefore they also lack standing to assert their claims 
under these specific statutes.                                            
    Accordingly, Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their request for a preliminary injunction.2 
 II.  Preliminary Injunction                                             

    2 The Superintendent’s Opposition also argues that he is not a proper party to this case under the Eleventh 
Amendment.  (Superintendent Opp. at 20-21.)  The Court will reserve judgment on this argument as it is also raised 
in the Superintendent’s motion to dismiss.  (ECF No. 31.)                 
    Even assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action and request a 
preliminary injunction, their request would still be denied.              
      a.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits                            
    As discussed above, Plaintiffs are requesting a preliminary injunction that will temporarily 

enjoin  Defendants  from  enforcing  Penal  Law  Sections  265.01(1),  265.01-b,  265.03(3),  and 
400.00(15) against those who (i) possess a valid New York State handgun license and who carry 
a handgun open and exposed on their person, and (ii) possess a valid unrestricted New York State 
concealed carry handgun license who carry a handgun concealed on their person within New York 
City, as the enforcement of these statutes is an infringement on their Second Amendment rights.  
(Mem. at 2-3.)                                                            
    Plaintiffs’ argument focuses on three main Supreme Court cases that they contend provide 
an absolute right for law-abiding citizens to carry handguns in self-defense in non-sensitive areas.  
(See Mem. at 6-21.)  First, the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 635 
(2008), held that the core of the Second Amendment is the “right of law-abiding, responsible 

citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.”  The Heller Court also held that the Second 
Amendment  guarantees  “the  individual  right  to  possess  and  carry  weapons  in  case  of 
confrontation.”  Id. at 592.  Second, the Court in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 767 
(2010),  incorporated  the  Second  Amendment  against  the  States  through  the  Fourteenth 
Amendment, and reaffirmed the use of handguns “for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.”  
Lastly, a concurrence opinion in Caetano v. Massachusetts, 577 U.S. 411, 416 (2016) (Alito, J., 
concurring), held that the right to bear arms includes the right to bear any weapon commonly used 
for self-defense.  Plaintiffs argue that these decisions prevent any infringement of keeping and 
bearing handguns for self-defense.  (Mem. at 14.)                         
    However, Plaintiffs fail to fully acknowledge the limitations set by the Supreme Court in 
the same cases they cite to support their position.  In Heller, the Court emphasized the “right 
secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited” and is “not a right to keep and carry any 
weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”  554 U.S. at 626.  The 

Court in McDonald reaffirmed the Heller Court’s holding and stated that “incorporation does not 
imperil every law regulating firearms.”  561 U.S. at 786.  Further, the Second Circuit has 
interpreted these decisions as holding “Second Amendment guarantees are at their zenith within 
the home.”  Kachalsky, 701 F.3d at 89 (emphasis added).                   
    Using  Heller  and  McDonald  as  guidance,  the  Second  Circuit  developed  a  two-step 
approach to analyze alleged violations of the Second Amendment:           
    First, we consider whether the restriction burdens conduct protected by the Second 
    Amendment.  If the challenged restriction does not implicate conduct within the 
    scope of the Second Amendment, our analysis ends and the legislation stands.  
    Otherwise, we move to the second step of our inquiry, in which we must determine 
    and apply the appropriate level of scrutiny.                         

New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. Cuomo, 804 F.3d 242, 254 (2d Cir. 2015).  For the first 
step, the Court analyzes “whether the challenged legislation impinges upon conduct protected by 
the Second Amendment,” or weapons “in common use” and “typically possessed by law-abiding 
citizens for lawful purposes.”  Id. at 254–55 (citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 625; 627).  For the second 
step, the Court utilizes two factors to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny: “(1) how close 
the law comes to the core of the Second Amendment right and (2) the severity of the law’s burden 
on the right.”  Id. at 258 (citing Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 703 (7th Cir. 2011)).  If the 
challenged legislation does not implicate the core or substantially burden the right, then heightened 
scrutiny does not apply.  Id.  Using this approach, the Second Circuit has upheld New York’s 
proper cause requirement for concealed carry permits, Kachalsky, 701 F.3d at 89, and prohibition 
of certain semiautomatic assault weapons, New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, 804 F.3d at 254.   
    While Plaintiffs aver that they are not challenging New York’s licensing scheme3, and try 
to distance their case from the Kachalsky holding by stating that no open carry challenge has ever 
been brought,4 a close look at the core of their arguments betrays such assertions.  In fact, 

Plaintiffs’ arguments are similar to the arguments made by the plaintiffs in Kachalsky.  Plaintiffs 
aver that banning the open carry of handguns is a per se violation of the Second Amendment 
because carrying a weapon for self-defense is “a guaranteed and fundamental right”, and therefore 
it must be struck down without applying either level of scrutiny.  (Mem. at 11; Superintendent 
Reply  at  5.)    Similarly,  in  Kachalsky  the  plaintiffs  contended  that  “history  and  tradition 
demonstrate that there is a ‘fundamental right’ to carry handguns in public, and though a state may 
regulate open or concealed carrying of handguns, it cannot ban both.”  701 F.3d at 89 (emphasis 
in original).  In addressing the plaintiffs’ challenge, the Second Circuit therefore evaluated New 
York’s licensing scheme as a whole, including the inability to obtain a permit for open carry.  Id. 

at 98 (“Restricting handgun possession in public to those who have a reason to possess the weapon 
for a lawful purpose is substantially related to New York’s interests in public safety and crime 
prevention.”).                                                            
    Notably, the Second Circuit was not convinced by the plaintiffs’ argument that their “desire 
for self-defense . . . is all the ‘proper cause’ required” to carry.  Id. at 99.  The Court discussed 
how the “extensive state regulation of handguns has never been considered incompatible with the 


    3 “Plaintiffs are not challenging the State’s licensing scheme.  Plaintiffs are challenging the assured 
enforcement of criminal penalties against them if they exercise their guaranteed right to possess and carry weapons 
for self-defense.”  (Plaintiffs’ Reply to Defendants New York City and Dermot Shea in Further Support of Motion 
for Preliminary Injunction (“City Defendants Reply”) ECF No. 27 at 1.)

Second Amendment or, for that matter, the common-law right to self-defense.  This includes 
significant restrictions on how handguns are carried, complete prohibitions on carrying the weapon 
in public, and even in some instances, prohibitions on purchasing handguns.”  Id. at 100.  
Consistent with the state’s “considerable authority—enshrined within the Second Amendment—

to regulate firearm possession in public,” the court held that requiring proper cause, or a special 
need for self-protection, before granting a concealed carry license was “entirely consistent with 
the right to bear arms.”  Id.  Here, Plaintiffs’ request is in direct dispute with the Kachalsky holding, 
as it would effectively render most of the regulatory scheme in Section 400.00 redundant and 
inconsequential, including the proper cause requirement needed for unrestricted concealed carry 
upheld in Kachalsky.                                                      
    Plaintiffs also aver this Court is bound to the Heller Court’s refusal to adopt an “interest-
balancing inquiry,” and therefore no tier of scrutiny applies.  (Superintendent Reply at 5; City 
Defendants Reply at 4-5.)  However, as the Second Circuit has stated, “[t]here was no need in 
Heller to further define the scope of the Second Amendment or the standard of review for laws 

that burden Second Amendment rights” as “the [D.C.] handgun ban would be unconstitutional 
under any of the standards of scrutiny.”  Kachalsky, 701 F.3d at 88 (internal alterations omitted).  
Instead, “Heller was never meant ‘to clarify the entire field’ of Second Amendment jurisprudence” 
and therefore the Second Circuit found that it could adopt its two-step analysis to determine other 
Second Amendment challenges.  Id. at 89 (citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 635).  While Plaintiffs argue 
the Second Circuit’s test has been “rejected by the Supreme Court” (Superintendent Reply at 7), 
this is incorrect.  While the dissenting opinion in Rogers v. Grewal, described the Kachalsky test 
as the kind rejected by Heller, 140 S. Ct. 1865, 1866–67 (2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting), the 
majority denied the petition of certiorari.  As Kachalsky is still good law, and Second Circuit 
decisions are binding on this Court, the Plaintiffs’ arguments fail.5     
    Plaintiffs heavily cite to Wrenn v. District of Columbia, 864 F.3d 650, 665 (D.D.C. 2017), 
to support their arguments.  In Wrenn, the D.C. Circuit enjoined enforcement of the D.C. law that 

confined carrying a handgun in public to those who could show “good reason to fear injury to 
[their] person or property” or “any other proper reason for carrying a pistol.”  Id. at 655.  The court 
held that under Heller “‘complete prohibition[s]’ of Second Amendment rights are always invalid” 
and “[i]t’s appropriate to strike down such ‘total ban[s]’ without bothering to apply tiers of scrutiny 
because no such analysis could ever sanction obliterations of an enumerated constitutional right.”  
Id. (citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 629).  As the D.C. good-reason requirement consisted of a “total ban 
on most D.C. residents’ right to carry a gun in the face of ordinary self-defense needs”, the law 
was considered a complete prohibition and struck down.  Id. at 666.       
    However, the Second Circuit has made clear that while the D.C. Circuit disagreed with its 
holding in Kachalsky and instead found that the Heller Court “favorably treated cases allowing 

bans on concealed carry only so long as open carry was allowed”, id. at 662, it would affirm its 
prior holding.  New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. City of New York, 883 F.3d 45, 56 n.5 (2d 
Cir. 2018) vacated and remanded on other grounds, 140 S. Ct. 1525, 206 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2020) 
(“We are aware that a divided panel of the Seventh Circuit and a divided panel of the District of 
Columbia Circuit have disagreed with Kachalsky . . . After giving careful and respectful attention 
to the reasoning of those opinions, we reaffirm our prior holding[.]); see also New York State Rifle 
& Pistol Ass’n v. Beach, 354 F. Supp. 3d 143, 148–49 (N.D.N.Y. 2018) (dismissing challenge to 


    5 The Court’s conclusions apply with equal force to Plaintiffs’ challenge to New York City’s firearms laws.  
See Corbett v. City of N.Y., No. 18 Civ. 7022 (KPF), 2019 WL 2502056, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 17, 2019) (upholding 
New York City’s proper cause requirement pursuant to Kachalsky).          
New York’s proper cause requirement after Wrenn was decided as the plaintiffs did not dispute 
that Kachalsky was binding and did “not advance[] any other factual allegations suggesting legally 
plausible claims.”).                                                      
    Therefore, based on established Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent, Plaintiffs 

do not have a high likelihood of success on the merits.                   
      b.  Irreparable Harm                                               
    “A showing of irreparable harm is ‘the single most important prerequisite for the issuance 
of a preliminary injunction.’”  Faiveley Transp. Malmo AB v. Wabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 
(2d Cir. 2009) (citing Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 F.3d 227, 234 (2d Cir. 1999)).  “[T]o satisfy the 
irreparable harm requirement, [p]laintiffs must demonstrate that absent a preliminary injunction 
they will suffer an injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but actual and imminent, and one 
that cannot be remedied if a court waits until the end of trial to resolve the harm.”  Id. (quoting 
Grand River Enter. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Pryor, 481 F.3d 60, 66 (2d Cir. 2007)).  The “mere 
possibility of irreparable harm is insufficient to justify the drastic remedy of a preliminary 

injunction.”  Borey v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 934 F.2d 30, 34 (2d Cir. 1991).   
    Here, Plaintiffs allege that they will be prosecuted criminally for openly carrying their 
handguns in public through New York State or in a concealed manner in New York City in the 
absence of the requested injunction, and that a constitutional violation constitutes irreparable harm.  
(Mem. at 22-23.)  In response, Defendants argue that a presumption of irreparable harm only arises 
where a plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits of the constitutional claim.  
(Superintendent Opp. at 35; City Defendants Opp. at 24.)                  
    “In  the  Second  Circuit  .  .  .  [the]  presumption  of  irreparable  harm  arising  from  a 
constitutional  deprivation  is  not  automatic.”  Joglo  Realties,  Inc.  v.  Seggos,  16-CV-1666 
(ARR)(CLP), 2016 WL 4491409, at *16 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2016).  Instead, “[b]ecause the 
violation of a constitutional right is the irreparable harm asserted [], the two prongs of the 
preliminary injunction threshold merge into one” and “in order to show irreparable injury, plaintiff 
must show a likelihood of success on the merits.”  Turley v. Giuliani, 86 F. Supp. 2d 291, 295 

(S.D.N.Y. 2000).  As the Second Circuit has held that it is “more appropriate to determine 
irreparable injury by considering what adverse factual consequences the plaintiff apprehends if an 
injunction is not issued, and then considering whether the infliction of those consequences is likely 
to violate any of the plaintiff’s rights,” Time Warner Cable v. Bloomberg L.P., 118 F.3d 917, 924 
(2d Cir. 1997), the alleged violations of Plaintiffs’ Second Amendment rights, by themselves, are 
not sufficient to show irreparable harm.                                  
    Further, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have failed to show a sufficient injury in fact for 
standing purposes.  As this requirement is “akin conceptually to the showing of irreparable harm 
necessary for the issuance of an injunction”, for the same reasons listed above, Plaintiffs have not 
shown an actual or imminent injury they will suffer if not granted the relief they seek.  Williams v. 

New York State Office of Mental Health, No. 10-CV-1022 (SLT) (JO), 2011 WL 4529651, at *3 
(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2011); see also In re Navy Chaplaincy, 534 F.3d 756, 766 (D.C. Cir. 2008) 
(“to show irreparable harm, ‘a plaintiff must do more than merely allege . . . harm sufficient to 
establish standing.’”) (quoting Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Coal. for Econ. Equity, 
950 F.2d 1401, 1410 (9th Cir. 1991)).                                     
    Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate they will suffer irreparable harm without 
an injunction.                                                            
      c.  Balance of Hardships and Public Interest                       
    Lastly, Plaintiffs aver there is a public interest in preventing the violation of constitutional 
rights,  and  where  a  plaintiff  establishes  a  likelihood  that  the  challenged  law  violates  the 
Constitution, he or she has also established that the public interest and balance of equities favor 
issuing an injunction.  (Mem. at 23.)  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ purported injuries are 

substantially outweighed by New York’s interest in protecting the public.  (City Defendants Opp. 
at 25; Superintendent Opp. at 38-39.)  New York’s licensing requirements have existed since 1913 
and have survived multiple challenges in New York and appellate courts.  See, e.g., Kachalsky, 
701 F.3d at 85.  Upending this system and allowing New York residents to openly carry firearms 
without showing proper cause would be an extreme remedy which would require “a clear showing 
that the moving party is entitled to the relief requested” or that “extreme or very serious damage” 
would result.”  Tom Doherty Assocs., 60 F.3d at 34.  As Plaintiffs have failed to make this showing, 
the balance of hardships clearly tip in Defendants’ favor.                
    Further, as the Second Circuit found in Kachalsky, “[t]here is a longstanding tradition of 
states regulating firearm possession and use in public because of the dangers posed to public 

safety.”  701 F.3d at 94–95.  While Plaintiffs claim that they fear for their safety due to “the 
defunding of the New York Police Department” and “the rise of roving, armed gangs in New York 
City,” (Compl. ¶¶ 115; 150; 181; 224), these conclusory claims fail to override the legislature’s 
determination that providing access to additional firearms would pose an even greater danger.   
    Accordingly,  both  the  balance  of  hardships  and  the  public  interest  are  securely  in 
Defendants’ favor.                                                        
                               CONCLUSION 
     For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.  The 
Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 20.
