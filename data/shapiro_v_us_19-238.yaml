outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== United States Social Security Administration''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. The SSA argued that the district court erred in holding that FOIA’s fee-preclusion provision (5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(viii)) overrides the Social Security Act’s cost-reimbursement provision (42 U.S.C. § 1306(c)), and that the latter statute authorizes the SSA to charge the full cost of responding to non-program-related FOIA requests notwithstanding FOIA’s fee provisions.

  2. The SSA contended that Shapiro’s FOIA request was not directly related to the administration of an SSA program, and therefore the agency was authorized to charge him the full cost of processing the request under § 1306(c).

  3. The SSA argued that the district court erred in awarding attorneys’ fees and costs to Shapiro because he did not substantially prevail on the central issue of his case.'
