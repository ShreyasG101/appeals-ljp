reason_for_appeal: '=== Elliott Ambrosio; Sierra Trenholm (Plaintiffs-Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that Progressive’s use of the Projected Sold Adjustment (PSA) in the Mitchell valuation reports always resulted in an inherently flawed, one-sided negative adjustment that breached the express terms of the uniform automobile insurance policy requiring that actual cash value be determined by the vehicle’s market value, age, and condition at the time of loss.

  2. Appellants contended that Progressive’s PSA methodology, which excluded or historically excluded transactions where vehicles sold at or above list price and applied only downward adjustments, was not a permissible way to determine ‘market value’ under the policy and thus violated Progressive’s contractual and methodological duties common to all insureds.

  3. Appellants asserted that Progressive’s uniform application of the PSA constituted a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because Progressive exercised its contractual discretion in a way that systematically underpaid actual cash value by using baseless negotiation deductions.

  4. Appellants argued that the PSA-based underpayments unjustly enriched Progressive by allowing it to pay less than the actual cash value owed under the policies.

  5. Appellants maintained that the injury to all class members was common and classwide because each class member’s Mitchell valuation was reduced by the PSA, and that any variation went only to the amount of damages, not to the existence of injury.

  6. Appellants contended that the district court erred in its Rule 23(b)(3) predominance analysis by concluding that individual issues surrounding calculation of each vehicle’s actual cash value predominated, instead of recognizing that the legality and contractual permissibility of the PSA methodology presented a common, classwide question of liability.

  7. Appellants argued that the district court improperly resolved merits issues at the class certification stage by effectively deciding that Progressive’s PSA methodology complied with the contract and that alternative valuation methods (such as NADA or Kelley Blue Book) were contractually permissible benchmarks for determining whether any class member was injured.

  8. Appellants contended that there was insufficient evidentiary and contractual basis for the district court to conclude, at class certification, that NADA and KBB were valid alternative methodologies for determining actual cash value under the policy, and that this erroneous contract construction led to the mistaken finding that many putative class members might be uninjured.

  9. Appellants argued that, even if NADA or KBB could theoretically be used under the contract, the possibility that some hypothetical alternative method might have produced lower valuations for some insureds does not negate the injury caused by Progressive’s actual use of the PSA to reduce Mitchell valuations.

  10. Appellants maintained that, under Arizona contract and insurance law, Progressive had no discretion to choose a valuation system that underpays actual cash value and that its duties of equal consideration, fairness, honesty, and good faith support treating the PSA-based underpayment as a common, triable injury suitable for class treatment.

  11. Appellants argued that the district court misapplied Ninth Circuit precedent, particularly Lara and Jama, by treating this case as controlled by Lara rather than recognizing that, like Jama, the challenged adjustment is a uniform, allegedly improper deduction that can be addressed and measured on a classwide basis by adding back the PSA.

  12. Appellants further contended that the district court’s predominance ruling was inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Olean, because it effectively required that the class contain no more than a de minimis number of uninjured members and used speculative individualized injury arguments to defeat predominance.'
