IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

NORTHWESTERN SELECTA, INC.                                               

      Plaintiff                                                          

          v.                                                             
                                        CIVIL NO. 22-1092(RAM)

SECRETARY  OF  THE  DEPARTMENT OF                                        
AGRICULTURE OF PUERTO RICO, Alex                                         
Muñiz Lasalle.                                                           

      Defendants                                                         

       OPINION AND ORDER REGARDING PERMANENT INJUNCTION                  
RAÚL M. ARIAS-MARXUACH, United States District Judge                      
    Pending before the Court is Plaintiff Northwestern Selecta,          
Inc’s (“Plaintiff” or “NWS”) request for declaratory judgment and         
permanent  injunction  as   articulated  in  its  Complaint   for         
Declaratory Judgment and Preliminary and Permanent Injunction and         
subsequent motions for emergency relief. (Docket Nos. 1, 35 and           
46). For the following reasons, Plaintiff’s request for a permanent       
injunction is GRANTED.                                                    
                         I.   BACKGROUND                                 
    Plaintiff filed a Verified Complaint against the Secretary           
and Deputy Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture         
(“PRDA”),   Ramón   González-Beiró   and   Alex    Muñiz-Lasalle,         
respectively (“Defendants”), seeking injunctive and declaratory           
relief  from  PRDA  Market  Regulation  No.  8,  registered  with  the    
Puerto Rico Department of State as Regulation No. 8764, titled “To        
Govern  the  Quality  and  Marketing  of  Poultry  Meat  in  the          
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico” (“Regulation No. 8” or “Regulation           
No. 8764”). (Docket No. 1).                                               
    Plaintiff  argues  that  Regulation  No.  8,  which  purportedly     
governs the quality and marketing of poultry meat in Puerto Rico,         
is preempted by the Poultry Products Inspection Act (“PPIA”), 21          
U.S.C. §§ 451-469, and the regulations promulgated thereunder by          
the Food Safety and Inspection Service (“FSIS”). Id. ¶¶ 1, 28, 31.        
NWS  specifically  challenges  Articles  XIV(A)(6)  and  XII(B)  of       
PRDA’s Regulation No. 8 for imposing requirements “in addition to,        
or different than” those established by the PPIA. Id. ¶ 31. Article       
XIV(A)(6) prohibits imported poultry from being labeled as “Keep          
Refrigerated or Frozen” despite the fact that FSIS regulation at          
9  C.F.R.  §  381.125(a)  allows  such  labeling.  Id.  ¶¶  32,  34.      
Similarly,  Plaintiff   asserts  that   Article  XII(B)   imposes         
additional “re-inspection” requirements beyond those established          
by PPIA and FSIS regulations. Id. ¶ 48-56.                                
    Pursuant to this Court’s order at Docket No. 6, the parties          

filed joint factual and document stipulations. (Docket No. 14-1).         
Plaintiff filed a Memorandum in Support of Request for Injunction         
and Defendants filed a brief in opposition. (Docket Nos. 23 and           
24).                                                                      
    Subsequently,  NWS  filed  the  present  Motion   Requesting         
Emergency Relief notifying the Court that the PDRA detained over          
40,000  lbs  of  poultry  products  for  containing  the  label  “Keep    
refrigerated or frozen”. (Docket No. 35). Plaintiff asked the Court       
to issue the proposed permanent injunction as requested in the            
Verified  Complaint  or  alternatively  issue  an  order,   i.e.,         
preliminary injunction, barring the PRDA from enforcing Regulation        
No. 8’s provisions regarding the labeling and packaging of poultry        
products until the Court issues a ruling resolving the case. Id.          
¶¶ 11-12.                                                                 
    On  December  29,  2022,  the  Court  granted  a  preliminary        
injunction  barring  the  enforcement  of  PRDA,  Article  XIV(A)(6)      
labeling and marketing requirements. (Docket No. 41). The Court           
found  that  the  prohibition  of  labeling  “Keep  refrigerated  or      
frozen” was directly at odds with and preempted by the PPIA and           
the regulations issued. Id.                                               
    On January 31, 20223, Plaintiff subsequently filed a Motion          
Requesting Emergency Relief to extend the preliminary injunction          

to the PRDA’s enforcement and implementation of Article XII(B).           
(Docket  No.  46).  Plaintiff  informed  the  Court  that  the  PRDA’s    
implementation of Article XII(B) has disrupted the orderly and            
timely operations of NWS. Id. at ¶¶ 12.                                   
                      II.  FINDINGS OF FACT                              
    Having analyzed the relevant pleadings on the docket, and the        
stipulations filed by the parties, the Court makes the following          
findings of fact1:                                                        
   1.  The NWS facilities located at 769 Calle C, Mario Juliá            
      Industrial Park, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00920 are certified         
      as  an  “official  establishment”  by  the  United  States         
      Department of Agriculture. (Docket No. 14-1 ¶ 1).                  
   2.  NWS imports fresh and frozen poultry products domestically        
      from the United States, as well as frozen poultry products         
      from foreign countries. Id. ¶ 2.                                   
   3.  Most NWS shipping containers containing poultry products          
      also contain other food products. Id. ¶ 3.                         
   4.  All importers, including NWS, provide copies of bills of          
      lading and inform the PRDA of the contents of the cargo            
      shipping containers that arrive to the Port of San Juan.           
      The  bills  of  lading  do  not  inform  the  PRDA  of  product    
      conditions upon arrival. Only a visual inspection of the           

      product  shows  the  product  condition  upon  arrival.  All       


1 References to a specific Finding of Fact shall be cited in the following 
manner: (Fact ¶ _).                                                       
  poultry products that NWS imports from within the United           
  States have already passed inspection on the mainland by           
  the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and bear an            
  official mark to that effect. Id. ¶ 4.                             
5.  PRDA  detained  fresh  poultry  products  shipped  from  the      
  United States by NWS bearing the label “Keep Refrigerated          
  or Frozen” and did not allow NWS to distribute the products        
  in Puerto Rico unless they were re-labeled with a label            
  that reads “Keep Refrigerated” or “Keep Frozen.” Id. ¶ 5.          
6.  On December 7, 2021, the PRDA Deputy Secretary, through           
  its   inspectors,  issued  several  Orders  of   Detention         
  impounding over 7,000 pounds of fresh poultry products at          
  the NWS facilities which had been imported from the United         
  States by NWS. The grounds for the Order of Detention were         
  that the products were labeled as “Keep Refrigerated or            
  Frozen” in violation of Article XIV(A)(6) of Regulation            
  No. 8. Id. ¶ 6.                                                    
7.  On June 30, 2021, the PRDA Deputy Secretary, through its          
  inspectors,  also  issued  several  Orders  of  Detention,         
  impounding over two hundred thousand (200,000) pounds of           

  fresh  poultry  products  imported  by  NWS  from  within  the     
  United States. The grounds for the Orders of Detention were        
  that a PRDA inspector was not physically present when the          
  shipping container containing the products was opened and          
  unloaded at the NWS facilities, asserting a violation of           
  Article XII(B) of Regulation No. 8. Id. ¶ 7.                       
8.  Since June 2021 and through March 2022, the PRDA Deputy           
  Secretary has: (a) issued Notices of Violation against NWS         
  with  respect  to  thirty-five  (35)  shipping  containers         
  containing poultry products imported from within the U.S.          
  that have been opened and unloaded at the NWS Facilities           
  without the presence of a PRDA inspector, and (b) asserted         
  the right to impose fines of approximately $263,000 against        
  NWS. Id. ¶ 8.                                                      
9.  The  Deputy  Secretary  would  not  rescind  the  Notices  of     
  Violation and continued to assert the right not to allow           
  NWS  to  open  and  unload  shipping  containers  containing       
  poultry products imported from within the United States at         
  the  NWS  facilities  without  the  presence  of  a  PRDA          
  inspector. Id. ¶ 9.                                                
10. The  USDA  and  the  FSIS  do  not  require  that  a  USDA-FSIS   
  inspector be present when NWS opens and unloads shipping           
  containers  containing  poultry  products  imported   from         

  within the United States at the NWS facilities. Id. ¶ 10.          
11. Prior to June 2021, PRDA had not enforced nor sought to           
  enforce Article XII(B) of Regulation No. 8 against NWS.            
  Id. ¶ 11.                                                          
12. On June 30, 2021, Agronomist Jaime Traverso visited the           
  NWS facilities located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. At the            
  moment of the visit, the containers subject to inspection          
  had been opened and its contents unloaded. The PRDA issued         
  Detention  Orders  10395,  10396,  10397,  10398,  10399  and      
  10400. Id. ¶ 12.                                                   
13. On June 30, 2021, Alex Muñiz, acting as Deputy Secretary          
  for Agro-Commercial Integrity, notified NWS that it had            
  violated Regulation No. 8764, and the PRDA’s intent to fine        
  NWS with $500.00 fines for each violation. Id. ¶ 13.               
14. On July 1, 2021, the PRDA rescinded the detention orders.         
  The detained product entered commerce. Id. ¶ 14.                   
15. On July 20, 2021, NWS filed a motion to reconsider with           
  the PRDA where Plaintiff argued, among other grounds, that         
  Regulation  No.  8764  was  preempted  by  federal  law  and       
  regulations. Id. ¶ 15.                                             
16. On August 19, 2021, the PRDA vacated without prejudice the        

  notices of violations. Id. ¶ 16.                                   
17. On August 30, 2021, the PRDA issued a notice of violation         
  and an order to NWS to show cause why it should not be held        
  in violation of Regulation No. 8764. Id. ¶ 17.                     
18. On September 14, 2021, NWS filed its motion showing cause         
  where it argued, among other grounds, that Regulation No.          
  8764 was preempted by federal law and regulations. Id. ¶           
  18.                                                                
19. On October 14, 2021, the PRDA issued a resolution and order       
  that denied the motion showing cause and imposed the fines         
  for each violation to Regulation No. 8764. Id. ¶ 19.               
20. On November 15, 2021, NWS requested reconsideration with          
  respect  to  the  October  14,  2021  resolution  and  order,      
  reiterating that the fines were preempted by federal law.          
  Id. ¶ 20.                                                          
21. On  January  10,  2022,  the  PRDA  filed  its  answer  to  the   
  administrative complaint. In it, PRDA asserted, among other        
  things, that the administrative forum was “not the adequate        
  forum” to resolve NWS’s claims of federal preemption. Id.          
  ¶ 21.                                                              
22. On January 20, 2022, the PRDA’s examining officer issued          

  an  order  slating  an  initial  scheduling  conference  for       
  February 2, 2022. Id. ¶ 22.                                        
   23. On  February  2,  2022,  an  initial  scheduling  hearing  was    
      held. Id. ¶ 23.                                                    
   24. On  December  15,  2022,  the  PRDA  issued  an  Order  for       
      Detention  notifying  NWS  that  the  PRDA  had  detained  908     
      boxes of full chicken totaling 49,761.11 pounds for failing        
      to comply with Regulation No. 8’s labeling requirements            
      because the chickens’ individual packaging contained the           
      terms “keep frozen or refrigerated.” (Docket No. 30-1).            
                       III.  APPLICABLE LAW                              
 A. Declaratory judgment                                                 
    The Declaratory Judgment Act (“DJA”) provides that:                  
         In  a  case  of  actual  controversy  within  its               
         jurisdiction  . . .  any  court  of  the  United                
         States,  upon  the  filing  of  an  appropriate                 
         pleading,  may  declare  the  rights  and  other                
         legal  relations  of  any  interested   party                   
         seeking  such  declaration,  whether  or  not                   
         further relief is or could be sought. Any such                  
         declaration shall have the force and effect of                  
         a  final  judgment  or  decree  and  shall  be                  
         reviewable as such.                                             

28 U.S.C. § 2201.                                                         
    The  First  Circuit  has  repeatedly  explained  that  the  DJA      
“neither  imposes  an  unflagging  duty  upon  the  courts  to  decide    
declaratory  judgment  actions  nor  grants  an  entitlement  to          
litigants  to  demand  declaratory  remedies.  In  other   words,         
declaratory relief, both by its very nature and under the plain           
language of 28 U.S.C. § 2201, is discretionary.” El Dia, Inc. v.          
Hernandez Colon, 963 F.2d 488, 493 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Ernst        
& Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st            
Cir. 1995).                                                               
    When exercising this discretion, courts must consider whether        
a declaratory judgment will (1) “help clarify the legal questions         
at issue[;]” and (2) “relieve the uncertainty or insecurity that          
gave rise to the dispute” or otherwise “expedite resolution of the        
underlying dispute.” Metro. Prop. & Liab. Ins. Co. v. Kirkwood,           
729 F.2d 61, 62 (1st Cir. 1984); see also, Cadillac Unif. & Linen         
Supply, Inc. v. Cent. Gen. de Trabajadores, 2020 WL 4289389, at *6        
(D.P.R. 2020), report and recommendation adopted sub nom. Cadillac        
Uniforms & Linen Supply, Inc. v. Cent. Gen. de Trabajadores, 2020         
WL 4289365, at *1 (D.P.R. 2020) (quotation omitted) (finding that         
declaratory judgment is favored when it serves a useful purpose in        
clarifying  and  settling  the  legal  relations  in  issue  and  will    
terminate and provide relief from the uncertainty, insecurity, and        
controversy giving rise to the proceeding.”).                             
 B. Preemption                                                           
    The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution states        
that:                                                                     

         This Constitution, and the Laws of the United                   
         States  which  shall  be  made  in  Pursuance                   
         thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall                  
         be  made,  under  the  Authority  of  the  United               
         States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land;                   
         and the Judges in every State shall be bound                    
         thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws                  
         of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.                   

U.S.  Const.  art.  VI,  cl.  2.  By  virtue  of  this  clause,  “the     
Constitution provides Congress with the power to pre-empt [sic]           
state law.” Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. F.C.C., 476 U.S. 355,          
357  (1986).  However,  “[f]ederal  law  is  presumed  not  to  have      
preemptive effect, and that presumption is overcome ‘only in the          
face of clear and contrary congressional intent.’” Siembra Finca          
Carmen, LLC. v. Sec’y of Dep’t of Agric. of Puerto Rico, 437 F.           
Supp. 3d 119, 127 (D.P.R. 2020) (quoting Antilles Cement Corp. v.         
Fortuño, 670 F.3d 310, 323 (1st Cir. 2012). See also Florida Lime         
and Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142 (1963).              
    Congress  may  indicate  its  intent  to  preempt  state  law  or    
regulations “through a statute’s express language or through its          
structure and purpose.” Altria Grp., Inc. v. Good, 555 U.S. 70, 76        
(2008). Accordingly, a federal statute can preempt state law in           
one of three ways: (1) express preemption, whereby “congressional         
intent to preempt state law is made explicit in the language of a         
federal statute[;]” (2) field preemption, when “federal regulation        
in a legislative field is so pervasive that congressional intent          
allows no inference that it left room for the states to supplement        
it[;]” or (3) conflict preemption, which may arise “when it is            
impossible to comply with both federal and state law” or “when the        
state law stands as an obstacle to achieving the objectives of            
federal law.” In re Allied Fin., Inc., 572 B.R. 45, 52-53 (Bankr.         
D.P.R. 2017) (citations omitted). See also Siembra Finca Carmen,          
LLC., 437 F. Supp. 3d at 127–28.                                          
 C. The PPIA and related federal regulations                             
    The  general  purpose  of  the  PPIA  is  “to  provide  for  the     
inspection of poultry and poultry products and to regulate their          
processing and distribution to prevent the movement or sale in            
interstate  or  foreign  commerce  of  such  products  which  are         
adulterated or misbranded.” Nw. Selecta, Inc. v. Munoz, 106 F.            
Supp. 2d 223, 228 (D.P.R. 2000) (citing 21 U.S.C. § 452).                 
    In its relevant part, the PPIA’s preemption clause provides:         
         Requirements within the scope of this chapter                   
         with  respect  to  premises,  facilities  and                   
         operations of any official establishment which                  
         are in addition to, or different than those                     
         made under this chapter may not be imposed by                   
         any  State  or  Territory  or  the  District  of                
         Columbia, except that any such jurisdiction                     
         may    impose   recordkeeping    and    other                   
         requirements within the scope of paragraph (b)                  
         of section 460 of this title, if consistent                     
         therewith,   with   respect   to   any   such                   
         establishment. Marking, labeling, packaging,                    
         or  ingredient  requirements  (or  storage  or                  
         handling requirements found by the Secretary                    
         to  unduly  interfere  with  the  free  flow  of                
         poultry products in commerce) in addition to,                   
         or  different  than,  those  made  under  this                  
         chapter may not be imposed by any State or                      
         Territory  or  the  District  of  Columbia  with                
         respect to articles prepared at any official                    
         establishment   in   accordance   with    the                   
         requirements under this chapter, but any State                  
         or Territory or the District of Columbia may,                   
         consistent with the requirements under this                     
         chapter exercise concurrent jurisdiction with                   
         the  Secretary  over  articles  required  to  be                
         inspected under this chapter for the purpose                    
         of preventing the distribution for human food                   
         purposes  of  any  such  articles  which  are                   
         adulterated or misbranded and are outside of                    
         such  an  establishment,  or,  in  the  case  of                
         imported  articles  which  are  not  at  such  an               
         establishment,  after  their  entry  into  the                  
         United States. This chapter shall not preclude                  
         any  State  or  Territory  or  the  District  of                
         Columbia  from  making  requirement  or  taking                 
         other action, consistent with this chapter,                     
         with respect to any other matters regulated                     
         under this chapter.

    i.   Federal labeling regulations                                    
    Chapter  III  Part  381  of  Title  IX  of  the  Code  of  Federal   
Regulations contains the poultry products inspection regulations          
that  implement  the  PPIA’s  provisions.  Subpart  N  establishes        
labeling  requirements  for   containers  of  poultry   products.         
Containers for inspected and passed poultry products must bear            
legible  labels  on  the  principal  display  that  contain  the          
information as required and outlined by subpart N in great detail.        
See 9 C.F.R. § 381.116. Specifically, the labels must identify the        
name,  class,  and  quantity  of  the  product;  any  ingredients  or     
additives;  identification  of   the  manufacturer,  packer,  or          
distributor;  the  official  inspection  legend  and  establishment       
number where the product was inspected; any specific dietary food         
properties; the applicable special handling label requirements;           
and the packing and processing date. See 9 C.F.R. §§ 381.117-126.         
Relevant to the case at bar, 9 C.F.R. § 381.125(a) provides:              
         Packaged  products   which  require   special                   
         handling to maintain their wholesome condition                  
         shall  have  prominently  displayed  on   the                   
         principal  display  panel  of  the  label  the                  
         statement:   “Keep    Refrigerated,”    “Keep                   
         Frozen,”  “Keep   Refrigerated  or   Frozen,”                   
         “Perishable—Keep  Under  Refrigeration,”   or                   
         such similar statement as the Administrator                     
         may approve in specific cases. The immediate                    
         containers for products that are frozen during                  
         distribution and intended to be thawed prior                    
         to or during display for sale shall bear the                    
         statement “Shipped/Stored and Handled Frozen                    
         for  Your  Protection,  Keep  Refrigerated  or                  
         Freeze.”                                                        
    In addition to identifying what information the labels must          
include, the PPIA’s accompanying regulations also dictates what           
information is impermissible on a label. 9 C.F.R. § 381.129(a)            
specifies that:                                                           
         No poultry product subject to the Act shall                     
         have any false or misleading labeling or any                    
         container that is so made, formed, or filled                    
         as to be misleading. However, established trade                 
         names and other labeling and containers which                   
         are  not  false  or  misleading  and  which  are                
         approved   by   the  Administrator   in   the                   
         regulations or in specific cases are permitted.                 

    § 381.129(b) provides several examples of what constitutes           
false or misleading statements, including:                                
         A   raw  poultry   product   whose   internal                   
         temperature has ever been below 26 °F may not                   
         bear  a  label  declaration  of  “fresh.”  A  raw               
         poultry product bearing a label declaration of                  
         “fresh”  but  whose  internal  temperature  has                 
         ever been below 26 °F is mislabeled”                            
         . . .                                                           

         Raw poultry product whose internal temperature                  
         has ever been at or below 0°F must be labeled                   
         with  the  descriptive  term  “frozen,”  except                 
         when  such  labeling  duplicates  or  conflicts                 
         with the labeling requirements in § 381.125 of                  
         this subchapter.                                                

Id. § 381.129(b)(6)(i)-(ii).                                              
    It is also worth noting that labels can only be used once            
they have been submitted and approved by the FSIS or if they are          
one  of  the  generically  approved  labels  authorized  by  the          
regulations. See 9 C.F.R. §§ 412.1-2.                                     
   ii.   Federal inspection regulations                                  
    The FSIS has established that “inspection of poultry products        
shall  be  rendered  pursuant  to  the  regulations  and  under  such     
conditions and in accordance with such methods as may be prescribed       
or approved by the Administrator.” 9 C.F.R. § 381.4. Under the            
PPIA as well as FSIS regulations, inspection is required at any           
establishment where poultry is slaughtered for transportation or          
sale in commerce, or in which any poultry products are wholly or          
in part processed for transportation or sale in commerce. 21 U.S.C.       
§ 458(a)(2); 9 C.F.R. § § 381.6, 381.145.                                 
 D. Puerto Rico Regulation No. 8                                         
    i.   Article XIV labeling requirements                               
    Article  XIV  of  Regulation  No.  8  specifies  the  labeling       
requirements  for  “[e]very  container  and  wrapping  used  for  the     
packing poultry meat that imported or marketed in Puerto Rico[.]”         
(Docket No. 1-6 at 29). Specifically, the label must contain “[t]he       
term ‘maintain refrigerated,’ if the product is fresh (26oF to            
36oF)” or “[t]he term ‘maintain frozen’ if the product is frozen          
(0oF  to  10oF).”  Id.  at  30;  See  Article  XIV(A)(4)-(5).  Article    
XIV(A)(6) provides that “[t]he terms ‘maintain refrigerated’ and          
‘maintain frozen’ may not be used in the labeling of the same             
package.” Id.                                                             
 ii.  Article XII(B) inspection requirements                             
    Article  XII(A)  of  Regulation  No.  8  provides  that  “[a]ll      
poultry meat that is imported to be marketed in Puerto Rico, will         
be inspected upon its arrival by an officer of the Department, to         
corroborate that the same meets the requirements required in this         
Regulation.” Id. at 27. Moreover, Article XII(B) requires that            
“[a]n official of the [PRDA] must be present at the time of opening       
and unloading the container.” Id.                                         
                         IV.  DISCUSSION                                 
    NWS seeks declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the          

basis  that  the  PPIA  preempts  the  PRDA’s  authority  to  impose      
distinct labeling and inspection requirements via Regulation No.          
8. When a party “claims federal law immunizes [them] from state           
regulation, the court may issue an injunction upon finding the            
state  regulatory  actions  preempted.”  Armstrong  v.  Exceptional       
Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326, 135 (2015) (citing Ex parte          
Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155–156 (1908)). Declaratory relief is proper        
in this case as it will clarify the legal questions in controversy        
and eliminate the uncertainty underlying the present dispute. See         
Metro Prop. & Liab. Ins. Co., 729 F.2d at 62.                             
    A  party  seeking  permanent  injunction  must  satisfy  the         
following four-factor test:                                               
         (1)  that  it  has  suffered  an  irreparable                   
         injury; (2) that remedies available at law,                     
         such as monetary damages, are inadequate to                     
         compensate  for   that  injury;   (3)   that,                   
         considering the balance of hardships between                    
         the  plaintiff  and  defendant,  a  remedy  in                  
         equity is warranted; and (4) that the public                    
         interest would not be disserved by a permanent                  
         injunction.                                                     

Greene  v.   Ablon,  794  F.3d  133,   156–57  (1st  Cir.   2015)         
(quoting CoxCom,  Inc.  v.  Chaffee, 536  F.3d  101,  112  (1st  Cir.     
2008)).                                                                   
 A. Irreparable harm                                                     

    Both  Article  XIV(A)  and  XII(B)  of  Regulation  No.  8  are      
preempted  by  the  PPIA.  The  PPIA’s  preemption  clause  prohibits     
states  and  territories  from  imposing  additional  or  distinct        
requirements with regards to “premises, facilities and operations         
of any official establishment” and “marking, labeling, packaging          
or ingredient requirements (or storage or handling requirements           
found by the Secretary to unduly interfere with the free flow of          
poultry products in commerce).” 21 U.S.C. § 467e. It is uncontested       
that NWS is an “official establishment” for purposes of the PPIA.2        
(Fact  ¶  1).  Therefore,  the  question  the  Court  is  tasked  with    
unscrambling is whether Regulation No. 8’s labeling and inspection        
requirements fall within the scope of this preemption clause.             
    When determining the substance and scope of an express pre-          
emption clause, courts must assume “that the historic police powers       
of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless         
that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.” Ass’n des           
Éleveurs de Canards et d’Oies du Quebec v. Becerra, 870 F.3d 1140,        
1146 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S.           
470, 485 (1996)).  Additionally, “[w]hen the text of an express           
pre-emption  clause  is  susceptible  of  more  than  one  plausible      
reading, courts ordinarily ‘accept the reading that disfavors pre-        
emption.’”  Altria  Grp.,  Inc.  v.  Good,  555  U.S.  70,  77  (2008)    
(quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, 544 U.S. 431, 449 (2005).         
    As discussed at length in the Court’s previous Opinion and           
Order  granting  a  preliminary  injunction,  Regulation  No.  8’s        


2 It is worth noting, however, that the PPIA most directly regulates “official 
establishments,” where the “inspection of the slaughter of poultry, or the 
processing of poultry products,” occurs. 21 U.S.C. § 453(p); see also 9 C.F.R. 
§ 381. Neither slaughter or processing occurs at NWS facilities and, therefore, 
they are not the kind of establishments that Congress sought to regulate most 
directly.                                                                 
labeling provision is expressly preempted by the PPIA. (Docket No.        
41 at 11-14). However, there is not a similar blanket preemption          
on  all  inspection  requirements.  The  PPIA’s  preemption  clause       
prohibits  states  and  territories  from  imposing  additional  or       
distinct requirements with regards to “premises, facilities and           
operations of any official establishment” and “marking, labeling,         
packaging  or  ingredient  requirements  (or  storage  or  handling       
requirements found by the Secretary to unduly interfere with the          
free flow of poultry products in commerce).” 21 U.S.C. § 467e.            
    Article  XII(B)  necessarily  relates  to  NWS’  operations,  of     
which  inspection  is  an  integral  part.  Plaintiff  asserts  that      
compliance with this regulation affects distribution operations by        
causing  delays  and   decreasing  the  shelf-life  of   imports,         
particularly when the PRDA inspector is untimely or fails to arrive       
completely.3 (Docket No. 46 ¶ 5). Notably, other district courts          
have found that more remote regulations affect operations. See,           
e.g., Johnson v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 2021 WL 5107723, at *6 (W.D.          
Tenn. 2021) (holding that “Tyson Foods’ vaccination policy relates        
to its premises, facilities, and operations by ensuring that its          
employees  are  protected  from  COVID-19  infection;  accordingly,       



3  The  absence  of  PRDA  inspectors  is  not  speculative,  given  the  PRDA’s 
Administrative Order 2022-14 issued on June 21, 2022, recognizing the lack of 
sufficient  inspectors,  and  thus  ordering  aleatory  inspections  of  imported 
products. (Docket No. 33-1 at 3-6).                                       
Plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of the PPIA” and are thus        
preempted).                                                               
    The question thus becomes whether Article XII(B)’s inspection        
requirement  falls  within  the  exception  outlined  by  the  PPIA’s     
preemption clause. As mentioned above, this clause also provides          
that:                                                                     
         any  State  or  Territory  or  the  District  of                
         Columbia may, consistent with the requirements                  
         under   this  chapter   exercise   concurrent                   
         jurisdiction with the Secretary over articles                   
         required to be inspected under this chapter                     
         for the purpose of preventing the distribution                  
         for human food purposes of any such articles                    
         which are adulterated or misbranded and are                     
         outside of such an establishment, or, in the                    
         case  of  imported  articles  which  are  not  at               
         such an establishment, after their entry into                   
         the United States.                                              

21 U.S.C. § 467e (emphasis added). Per the plain language of this         
section, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico can exercise concurrent          
jurisdiction with regards to inspection items thar are either (1)         
adulterated  or  misbranded  and  are  outside  of  an   official         
establishment; or (2) imported articles that are not at an official       
establishment after their entry into the United States. Id. In            
both   instances,   the  products   are   outside   of   official         
establishments. The poultry products imported by NWS do not fall          
under  either  of  these  two  categories.  NWS  facilities  are  an      
official  establishment  that  imports  fresh  and  frozen  poultry       
products domestically from within the United States, as well as           
frozen  poultry  products  from  foreign  countries.  (Fact  ¶  2).       
Therefore, the poultry products they import are necessarily inside        
an official establishment. Accordingly, the PRDA lacks concurrent         
jurisdiction  to  impose  inspection  requirements  with  regards  to     
these products and Article XII(B) is preempted.                           
 B. Absence of adequate remedies                                         

    An integral element in issuing a permanent injunction is the         
unavailability, or at least inadequacy, of legal remedies. See In         
re  Willis,  411  B.R.  783,  786  (Bankr.  S.D.  Fla.  2009).  As  NWS   
explained,  the  detainment  of  thousands  of  pounds  of  poultry       
significantly affects their operations which cannot be solved by          
monetary damages. Furthermore, the damage to NWS’s reputation and         
products caused by a delay in inspection cannot be solved through         
other legal or financial remedies.                                        
 C.  Balance of hardships                                                

    When balancing hardships courts must consider “the hardship          
that will befall the nonmovant if the injunctions issues . . .            
with the hardship that will befall the movant if the injunction           
does not issue.” Mercado-Salinas v. Bart Enterprises Int’l, Ltd.,         
671 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2011)). As the Court noted in its previous      
Opinion and Order, a government agency’s interests cannot be harmed       
“by the inability to continue enforcing preempted laws.” Siembra          
Finca Carmen, LLC., 437 F. Supp. 3d at 137. See also CTIA - The           
Wireless Ass’n v. Telecomm. Regul. Bd. of Puerto Rico, 2012 WL            
12845587,  *3  (D.P.R.  2012), report  and  recommendation  adopted       
(quoting Legend Night Club v. Miller, 637 F.3d 291, 302-03 (4th           
Cir. 2011)) (“Generally, a state ‘is in no way harmed by issuance         
of  an  injunction   that  prevents  the  state  from   enforcing         
unconstitutional  restrictions.’”).   By  contrast,   NWS   faces         
irreparable harm. Therefore, the balance of hardships favors a            
permanent injunction.                                                     
 D. Public interest                                                      

    The public interest which the fourth factor refers to is “the        
public  interest  in  the  issuance  of the  injunction  itself.”         
Braintree Labs., Inc. v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts, Inc., 622 F.3d 36,         
45 n.8 (1st Cir. 2010)) (emphasis in original). When analyzing            
this factor, the Court looks towards “a fit (or lack of friction)         
between the injunction and the public interest.” NuVasive, Inc. v.        
Day, 954 F.3d 439, 443 (1st Cir. 2020). “Just as a government has         
no  interest  in  enforcing  an  unconstitutional  law,  the  public      
interest is harmed by the enforcement of laws repugnant to the            
United States Constitution.” Siembra Finca Carmen, LLC., 437 F.           
Supp. 3d at 137. Moreover, the public has a strong interest in            
avoiding shortages of key food items such as poultry products.            
Therefore,  all  four  factors  favor  the  issuance  of  a  permanent    
injunction barring the application of Article XIV(A)’s labeling           
requirements and Article XII(B)’s PRDA inspector requirement.             
                         V.   CONCLUSION                                 
    In light of the above, Plaintiff’s request for a Declaratory         
Judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and Permanent Injunction are        
GRANTED.  The  Court  hereby  DECLARES  that  Articles  XII(B)  and       
XIV(A)(6) of Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture Regulation No.         
8764 (Market Regulation No. 8), are preempted by Section 467(e) of        
the Poultry Products Inspection Act (“PPIA”), 21 U.S.C. §§ 451-           
469.                                                                      
    Accordingly,  the  Court  hereby  GRANTS  permanent  injunctive      
relief and thus Defendants Ramón González-Beiró, Secretary of the         
Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, and Alex Muñiz-Lasalle, the        
Deputy Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, as         
well as their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and        
any other persons who are in active concert or participation with         
them, are hereby ENJOINED from:                                           
   A.  Enforcing Articles XII(B) and XIV(A)(6) of Regulation No.         
      8 against Northwestern Selecta;                                    
   B.  Enforcing  or  giving  effect  to  Article  XIV(A)(6)  of         

      Regulation No. 8 that imposes requirements with respect to         
      marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredients that are in           
      addition to, or different than those made under the PPIA;          
   C.  Enforcing or giving effect to Article XII(B) of Regulation        
      No. 8 requiring that a PRDA inspector be physically present        
      when  shipping  containers  are  opened  and  unloaded  in         
      official establishments; and                                       
   D.  Detaining imported poultry products or levying sanctions          
      (including suspension or revocation of any license issued          
      by the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, or failure           
      to renew the same) against Northwestern Selecta for failure        
      to comply with Articles XII(B) and/or XIV(A)(6) of Market          
      Regulation No. 8.                                                  
    This permanent injunction does not constitute a limitation on        
the PRDA’s enforcement of Regulation No. 8 provisions that are            
identical to federal regulations.                                         
    Judgment shall be entered accordingly.                               
    IT IS SO ORDERED.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT                        
                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO                          

NORTHWESTERN SELECTA, INC.

          v.

       OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION                 
RAÚL M. ARIAS-MARXUACH, United States District Judge                      
    Pending the before the Court is Plaintiff’s Urgent Motion            
Requesting  Emergency  Relief  Due  to  Illegal  Enforcement  of          
Regulation 8 (“Motion Requesting Emergency Relief”). (Docket No.          
35).  For  the  following  reasons,  Plaintiff’s  request  for  a         
preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of Regulation 8’s          
labeling and marketing requirements is GRANTED.                           
                         I.   BACKGROUND                                 
    Northwestern Selecta, Inc.’s (“Plaintiff” or “NWS”) filed a          
Verified Complaint against the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of          
the  Puerto  Rico  Department  of  Agriculture  (“PRDA”),  Ramón          
González-Beiró    and     Alex    Muñiz-Lasalle,     respectively         
(“Defendants”),  seeking  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  from      
PRDA  Market  Regulation  No.  8,  registered  with  the  Puerto  Rico    
Department of State as Regulation No. 8764 titled “To Govern the          
Quality and Marketing of Poultry Meat in the Commonwealth of Puerto       
Rico” (“Regulation 8” or “Regulation No. 8764”). (Docket No. 1).          
    Plaintiff argues that Regulation 8, which purportedly governs        
the  quality  and  marketing  of  poultry  meat  in  Puerto  Rico,  is    

preempted  by  the  Poultry  Products  Inspection  Act  (“PPIA”),  21     
U.S.C. §§ 451-469, and the regulations promulgated thereunder by          
the Food Safety and Inspection Service (“FSIS”). Id. ¶¶ 1, 28, 31.        
NWS  specifically  challenges  Articles  XIV(A)(6)  and  XII(B)  of       
PRDA’s Regulation 8 for imposing requirements “in addition to, or         
different than” those established by the PPIA. Id. ¶ 31. Article          
XIV(A)(6) prohibits imported poultry from being labeled as “Keep          
Refrigerated or Frozen” despite the fact that FSIS regulation at          
9  C.F.R.  §  381.125(a)  allows  such  labeling.  Id.  ¶¶  32,  34.      
Similarly,  Plaintiff   asserts  that   Article  XII(B)   imposes         
additional “re-inspection” requirements beyond those established          

by PIPA and FSIS regulations. Id. ¶ 48-56.                                
    Pursuant to this Court’s order at Docket No. 6, the parties          
filed joint factual and document stipulations. (Docket No. 14-1).         
Plaintiff filed a Memorandum in Support of Request for Injunction         
and Defendants filed a brief in opposition. (Docket Nos. 23 and           
24).                                                                      
    Subsequently,  NWS  filed  the  present  Motion   Requesting         
Emergency Relief notifying the Court that the PDRA detained over          
40,000  lbs  of  poultry  products  for  containing  the  label  “Keep    
refrigerated or frozen”. (Docket No. 35). Plaintiff asks the Court        
to issue the proposed permanent injunction as requested in the            
Verified  Complaint  or  alternatively  issue  an  order,   i.e.,         

preliminary injunction, barring the PRDA from enforcing Regulation        
8’s provisions regarding the labeling and packaging of poultry            
products until the Court issues a ruling resolving the case. Id.          
¶¶ 11-12.                                                                 
                      II.  FINDINGS OF FACT                              
    Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) requires that courts must state the            
findings  that  support  its  decision  in  granting  or  refusing  an    
interlocutory injunction. Having analyzed the relevant pleadings          
on the docket, and the stipulations filed by the parties, the Court       
makes the following findings of fact1:                                    
    1. The NWS facilities located at 769 Calle C, Mario Juliá            

      Industrial Park, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00920 are certified         
      as  an  “official  establishment”  by  the  United  States         
      Department of Agriculture. (Docket No. 14-1 ¶ 1).                  




1 References to a specific Finding of Fact shall be cited in the following 
manner: (Fact ¶ _).                                                       
2. NWS imports fresh and frozen poultry products domestically        
  from within the United States, as well as frozen poultry           
  products from foreign countries. Id. ¶ 2.                          
3. PRDA detained fresh poultry products from within the US by        
  NWS bearing the label “Keep Refrigerated or Frozen” and            
  did not allow NWS to distribute the products in Puerto Rico        

  unless they were re-labeled with a label that reads “Keep          
  Refrigerated” or “Keep Frozen.” Id. ¶ 5.                           
4. On December 7, 2021, the PRDA Deputy Secretary, through           
  its   inspectors,  issued  several  Orders  of   Detention         
  impounding over 7,000 pounds of fresh poultry products at          
  the NWS facilities which had been imported from within the         
  U.S. by NWS. The grounds for the Order of Detention were           
  that the products were labeled as “Keep Refrigerated or            
  Frozen” in violation of Article XIV(A)(6) of Regulation 8.         
  Id. ¶ 6.                                                           
5.  On June 30, 2021, Alex Muñiz, acting as Deputy Secretary          

  for Agro-Commercial Integrity, notified NWS that it had            
  violated Regulation 8764, and its intent to fine NWS with          
  $500.00 fines for each violation. Id. ¶ 13.                        
6.  On July 1, 2021, the PRDA rescinded the detention orders.         
  The detained product entered commerce. Id. ¶ 14.                   
7.  On July 20, 2021, NWS filed a motion to reconsider with           
  the  PRDA  where  it  argued,  among  other  grounds  that         
  Regulation   8764  was  preempted   by  Federal  Law  and          
  regulations. Id. ¶ 15.                                             
8.  On August 19, 2021, the PRDA vacated without prejudice the        
  notices of violations. Id. ¶ 16.                                   
9.  On August 30, 2021, the PRDA issued a notice of violation         
  and an order to NWS to show cause why it should not be held        

  in violation of Regulation 8764. Id. ¶ 17.                         
10. On September 14, 2021, NWS filed its motion showing cause         
  where it argued, among other grounds, that Regulation 8764         
  was preempted by Federal Law and regulations. Id. ¶ 18.            
11. On October 14, 2021, the PRDA issued a resolution and order       
  that denied the motion showing cause and imposed the fines         
  for each violation to Regulation 8764. Id. ¶ 19.                   
12. On November 15, 2021, NWS requested reconsideration with          
  respect  to  the  October  14,  2021  resolution  and  order,      
  reiterating that the fines were preempted by federal law.          
  Id. ¶ 20.                                                          

13. On  January  10,  2022,  the  PRDA  filed  its  answer  to  the   
  administrative complaint. In it, PRDA asserted, among other        
  things, that the administrative forum was “not the adequate        
  forum” to resolve NWS’s claims of federal preemption. Id.          
  ¶ 21.                                                              
   14. On January 20, 2022, the PRDA’s examining officer issued          
      an order scheduling an initial scheduling conference for           
      February 2, 2022. Id. ¶ 22.                                        
   15. On  February  2,  2022,  an  initial  scheduling  hearing  was    
      held. Id. ¶ 23.                                                    
   16. On  December  15,  2022,  the  PRDA  issued  an  Order  for       

      Detention notifying NWS that it had detained 908 boxes of          
      full chicken totaling 49,761.11 lbs for failing to comply          
      with  Regulation  8’s  labeling  requirements  because  the        
      chicken  in  its  individual  packaging  as  the  terms  “Keep     
      frozen or refrigerated.” (Docket No. 30-1).                        
                       III.  APPLICABLE LAW                              
 A. Preemption                                                           
    The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution states        
that:                                                                     
         This Constitution, and the Laws of the United                   
         States  which  shall  be  made  in  Pursuance                   
         thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall                  
         be  made,  under the  Authority  of  the  United                
         States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land;                   
         and the Judges in every State shall be bound                    
         thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws                  
         of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.                   

U.S.  Const.  Arti.  VI,  cl.2.  By  virtue  of  this  clause,  “the      
Constitution provides Congress with the power to pre-empt [sic]           
state law.” Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. F.C.C., 476 U.S. 355,          
357  (1986).  However,  “[f]ederal  law  is  presumed  not  to  have      
preemptive effect, and that presumption is overcome ‘only in the          
face of clear and contrary congressional intent.’” Siembra Finca          
Carmen, LLC. v. Sec'y of Dep't of Agric. of Puerto Rico, 437 F.           
Supp. 3d 119, 127 (D.P.R. 2020) (quoting Antilles Cement Corp. v.         
Fortuño, 670 F.3d 310, 323 (1st Cir. 2012). See also Florida Lime         
and Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142 (1963).              

    Congress  may  indicate  its  intent  to  preempt  state  law  or    
regulations “through a statute's express language or through its          
structure and purpose.” Altria Grp., Inc. v. Good, 555 U.S. 70, 76        
(2008). Accordingly, a federal statute can preempt state law in           
one of three ways: (1) express preemption whereby “congressional          
intent to preempt state law is made explicit in the language of a         
federal statute[;]” (2) field preemption when “federal regulation         
in a legislative field is so pervasive that congressional intent          
allows no inference that it left room for the states to supplement        
it[;]” or (3) conflict preemption which may arise “when it is             
impossible to comply with both federal and state law” or “when the        

state law stands as an obstacle to achieving the objectives of            
federal law.” In re Allied Fin., Inc., 572 B.R. 45, 52-53 (Bankr.         
D.P.R. 2017) (citations omitted). See also Siembra Finca Carmen,          
LLC., 437 F. Supp. at 127–28.                                             
 B. The PPIA and related regulations                                     
    The  general  purpose  of  the  PPIA  is  “to  provide  for  the     
inspection of poultry and poultry products and to regulate their          
processing and distribution to prevent the movement or sale in            
interstate  or  foreign  commerce  of  such  products  which  are         
adulterated or misbranded.” Nw. Selecta, Inc. v. Munoz, 106 F.            
Supp. 2d 223, 228 (D.P.R. 2000) (citing 21 U.S.C. § 452).                 
    In its relevant part, the PPIA’s preemption clause provides:         
         Requirements within the scope of this chapter                   
         with  respect  to  premises,  facilities  and                   
         operations of any official establishment which                  
         are in addition to, or different than those                     
         made under this chapter may not be imposed by                   
         any  State  or  Territory  or  the  District  of                
         Columbia, except that any such jurisdiction                     
         may    impose   recordkeeping    and    other                   
         requirements within the scope of paragraph (b)                  
         of section 460 of this title, if consistent                     
         therewith,   with   respect   to   any   such                   
         establishment. Marking, labeling, packaging,                    
         or ingredient requirements […] in addition to,                  
         or  different  than,  those  made  under  this                  
         chapter may not be imposed by any State or                      
         Territory  or  the  District  of  Columbia  with                
         respect to articles prepared at any official                    
         establishment   in   accordance   with    the                   
         requirements under this chapter, but any State                  
         or Territory or the District of Columbia may,                   
         consistent with the requirements under this                     
         chapter exercise concurrent jurisdiction with                   
         the  Secretary  over  articles  required  to  be                
         inspected under this chapter for the purpose                    
         of preventing the distribution for human food                   
         purposes  of  any  such  articles  which  are                   
         adulterated or misbranded and are outside of                    
         such  an  establishment,  or,  in  the  case  of                
         imported  articles  which  are  not  at  such  an               
         establishment,  after  their  entry  into  the                  
         United States. This chapter shall not preclude                  
         any  State  or  Territory  or  the  District  of                
         Columbia  from  making  requirement  or  taking                 
         other action, consistent with this chapter,                     
         with respect to any other matters regulated                     
         under this chapter.                                             
21 U.S.C. § 467e (emphasis added).                                        
    Chapter  III  Part  381  of  Title  IX  of  the  Code  of  Federal   
Regulations contains the poultry products inspection regulations          
that  implement  the  PPIA’s  provisions.  Subpart  N  establishes        
labeling  requirements  for   containers  of  poultry   products.         
Containers for inspected and passed poultry products must bear            

legible  labels  on  the  principal  display  that  contain  the          
information as required and outlined by subpart N in great detail.        
See 9 C.F.R. § 381.116. Specifically, the labels must identify the        
name,  class  and  quantity  of  the  product;  any  ingredients  or      
additives;  identification   of  the   manufacturer,  packer   or         
distributor;  the  official  inspection  legend  and  establishment       
number where the product was inspected; any specific dietary food         
properties; the applicable special handling label requirements;           
and the packing and processing date. See 9 C.F.R. §§ 381.117-126.         
Relevant to the case at bar, 9 C.F.R. § 381.125(a) provides:              
         Packaged  products   which  require   special                   
         handling to maintain their wholesome condition                  
         shall  have  prominently  displayed  on   the                   
         principal  display  panel  of  the  label  the                  
         statement:   “Keep    Refrigerated,”    “Keep                   
         Frozen,”  “Keep   Refrigerated  or   Frozen,”                   
         “Perishable—Keep  Under  Refrigeration,”   or                   
         such similar statement as the Administrator                     
         may approve in specific cases. The immediate                    
         containers for products that are frozen during                  
         distribution and intended to be thawed prior                    
         to or during display for sale shall bear the                    
         statement “Shipped/Stored and Handled Frozen                    
         for  Your  Protection,  Keep  Refrigerated  or                  
         Freeze.”                                                        
    In addition to identifying what information the labels must          
include, the PPIA’s accompanying regulations also dictates what           
information is impermissible on a label. 9 C.F.R. § 381.129(a)            
specifies that:                                                           
         No poultry product subject to the Act shall                     
         have any false or misleading labeling or any                    
         container that is so made, formed, or filled                    
         as to be misleading. However, established trade                 
         names and other labeling and containers which                   
         are  not  false  or  misleading  and  which  are                
         approved   by   the  Administrator   in   the                   
         regulations or in specific cases are permitted.                 

    § 381.129(b) provides several examples of what constitutes           
false or misleading statements, including:                                
         A   raw  poultry   product   whose   internal                   
         temperature has ever been below 26 °F may not                   
         bear  a  label  declaration  of  “fresh.”  A  raw               
         poultry product bearing a label declaration of                  
         “fresh”  but  whose  internal  temperature  has                 
         ever been below 26 °F is mislabeled”                            

         […]                                                             

         Raw poultry product whose internal temperature                  
         has ever been at or below 0°F must be labeled                   
         with  the  descriptive  term  “frozen,”  except                 
         when  such  labeling  duplicates  or  conflicts                 
         with the labeling requirements in § 381.125 of                  
         this subchapter.                                                

    Id. § 381.129(b)(6)(i)-(ii).                                         
    It is also worth noting that labels can only be used once            
they have been submitted and approved by the FSIS or if they are          
one  of  the  generically  approved  labels  authorized  by  the          
regulations. See 9 C.F.R. §§ 412.1-2.                                     
 C. Regulation 8                                                         
    Article  XIV   of  Regulation  8   specifies  the   labeling         
requirements  for  “[e]very  container  and  wrapping  used  for  the     
packing poultry meat that imported or marketed in Puerto Rico[.]”         
Specifically,  the  label  must  contain  “[t]he  term  ‘maintain         
refrigerated,’ if the product is fresh (26oF to 36oF)” or “[t]he          

term ‘maintain frozen’ if the product is frozen (0oF to 10oF). See        
Article  XIV(A)(4)-(5).  Article  XIV(A)(6)  provides  that  “[t]he       
terms ‘maintain refrigerated’ and ‘maintain frozen’ may not be            
used in the labeling of the same package.”                                
                         IV.  DISCUSSION                                 
    NWS  seeks  injunctive  relief  on  the  basis  that  the  PPIA      
preempts  the  PRDA’s  authority  to  impose  distinct   labeling         
requirements via Regulation 8. When a party “claims federal law           
immunizes [them] from state regulation, the court may issue an            
injunction upon finding the state regulatory actions preempted.”

    When  faced  with  a  motion  for  a  preliminary  injunction,       
district courts must assess the following four elements:                  
         (1) the likelihood of success on the merits;                    
         (2) the potential for irreparable harm if the                   
         injunction  is  denied;  (3)  the  balance  of                  
         relevant impositions, i.e., the hardship to                     
         the nonmovant if enjoined as contrasted with                    
         the hardship to the movant if no injunction                     
         issues; and (4) the effect (if any) of the                      
         court's ruling on the public interest.                          

Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151,           
162  (1st  Cir.  2004) (quoting  Ross-Simons  of  Warwick,  Inc.  v.      
Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996)).                         
 A. Likelihood of success on the merits                                  
    The “likelihood of success” factor “is ‘the touchstone of the        
preliminary  injunction  inquiry.’” Bos.  Duck  Tours,  LP  v.  Super     
Duck Tours, LLC, 531 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Philip           
Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d 670, 674 (1st Cir. 1998)).          
If said likelihood cannot be demonstrated by the moving party “the        
remaining  factors  become   matters  of  idle  curiosity.”   Id.         
(quoting New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287           
F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002)).                                               
    Although the PPIA permits some concurrent jurisdiction and           
enforcement, § 467(e) contains an “express preemption provision”          
which  prohibits  states  and  territories  from  imposing  marking,      
labeling, packaging or ingredient requirements in addition to or          
different than those required by the PPIA and its accompanying            
regulations. See La Vigne v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 772 F. App'x         
4, 5 (2d Cir. 2019). See also Nat'l Broiler Council v. Voss, 44           
F.3d  740,  746  (9th  Cir.  1994)  (“Although  the  PPIA  allows  for    
concurrent state jurisdiction with regards to certain aspects of          
poultry regulations, that is not the case with the labels required        
for poultry products under the act. . . The pre-emption clause as         
to labeling requirements evinces no such intent and uses no such          
language.”) (emphasis added).2                                            
    As this District has previously held, “[t]here is no doubt           
that Congress, pursuant to § 467e, intended to preempt requirements       
imposed by the state [or territory] which are ‘in addition to’ or         

‘different  from’  the  ‘marking’ requirements  established  in  the      
PPIA.” Munoz, 106 F. Supp. 2d at 229. The same conclusion must be         
reached with regards to labeling requirements.  9 C.F.R. § 381.125        
expressly authorizes labels with the statement “Keep Refrigerated         
or  Frozen[.]”  However,  such  language  is  prohibited  under  any      
circumstances  by  Regulation  8,  Article  XIV(A)(6).  Therefore,        
Article  XIV(A)(6)  impermissibly  imposes  requirements  which  are      
“different from” the labeling requirements established pursuant to        
the PPIA.                                                                 
    Furthermore, per 9 C.F.R. § 412.1(a), labels must be submitted       
for approval to the FSIS before being used. Thus, in order to             

comply with Article XIV(A)(6), NWS would have to modify its label         
that were approved by the FSIS. See, e.g., Webb v. Trader Joe's           
Co., 999 F.3d 1196, 1201–02 (9th Cir. 2021) (“Requiring Trader            
Joe's  to change its   labeling   ...  would   require changes to         


2 Defendants rely mostly on Ass'n des Éleveurs de Canards et d'Oies du Quebec 
v. Becerra, 870 F.3d 1140, 1152 (9th Cir. 2017), but it is inapposite, as it 
addresses concurrent state regulations under the PPIA but in matters distinct 
from labeling requirements.                                               
poultry labels that were approved by FSIS. Because Webb's state           
law  claims  seek  to  impose  requirements  “in  addition  to”  those    
outlined in the PPIA, her claims are preempted.”).                        
    In light of the above and given the PPIA’s express preemption        
with regards to labeling requirements, Plaintiffs have established        
a likelihood of success on the merits. Thus, this factor favors           

the  issuance  of  a  preliminary  injunction  baring  the  PRDA  form    
enforcing the preempted labeling regulation at Article XIV(A)(6).         
However, what remains impermissible under both the PPIA and Article       
XIV(A) is labeling a poultry product whose internal temperature           
has ever been below 26o F as fresh.                                       
 B. Irreparable harm                                                     
    Within the preliminary injunction context, irreparable harm          
“means an injury that cannot adequately be compensated either by          
a later-issued permanent injunction, after a full adjudication on         
the  merits,  or  by  a  later-issued  damages  remedy.” Rio  Grande      
Community Health Center, Inc. v. Rullan, 397 F.3d 56 (1st Cir.            

2005). In other words, irreparable harm exists when traditional           
legal remedies are inadequate. See Doble Seis Sport TV, Inc. v.           
Puerto Rico (D.P.R. 2019) (quoting Kmart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza,         
Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 915 (1st Cir. 1989)); Ross-Simons of Warwick,         
Inc., 102 F.3d at 18 (“It is usually enough if the plaintiff shows        
that  its  legal  remedies  are  inadequate.”).  Furthermore,  the        
articulated irreparable harm must be “likely and imminent, not            
remote or speculative.” N.A.A.C.P., Inc. v. Town of E. Haven, 70          
F.3d 219, 224 (2d Cir. 1995).                                             
    Once  a  law  or  regulation  is  deemed  to  be  preempted,  a      
plaintiff  “is  likely  to  experience irreparable harm by  having        
to choose between following federal law, which opens [them] up to         
liability under state law, or complying with an unconstitutional          

state law.” Maine Forest Prod. Council v. Cormier, 586 F. Supp. 3d        
22, 62–63 (D. Me.), aff'd, 51 F.4th 1 (1st Cir. 2022). See also           
Siembra Finca Carmen, LLC., 437 F. Supp. 3d at 137. (finding that         
the plaintiff “demonstrated that it is likely to suffer irreparable       
harm  in  the  absence  of  an  injunction  forbidding  PRDA  from        
continuing to enforce preempted laws.”). In the case at bar, the          
harm is not speculative, as Regulation 8’s labeling requirements          
are actively being enforced and thousands of pounds of poultry            
products are currently being detained pursuant to its preempted           
provisions.  (Fact  ¶  16).  Therefore,  this  factor  also  favors  a    
preliminary injunction.                                                   

 C. Balance of hardships                                                 
    When examining this third factor, “the Court must weight ‘the        
hardship that will befall the nonmovant if the injunctions issues         
[...]  with  the  hardship  that  will  befall  the  movant  if  the      
injunction does not issue.’” Am. Cruise Ferries, Inc. v. Vazquez          
Garced, 2020 WL 7786939, at *15 (D.P.R. 2020) (quoting Mercado-           
Salinas v. Bart Enterprises Int'l, Ltd., 671 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.        
2011)).  As  this  District  has  previously  held,  there  is  no        
convincing argument to explain why a government agency’s interests        
“are harmed by the inability to continue enforcing preempted laws.”       
Siembra Finca Carmen, LLC., 437 F. Supp. 3d at 137. See also CTIA         
- The Wireless Ass'n v. Telecommunications Regul. Bd. of Puerto           
Rico,   2012   WL  12845587,   *3   (D.P.R.   2012), report   and         

recommendation adopted (quoting Legend Night Club v. Miller, 637          
F.3d 291, 302-03 (4th Cir. 2011)) (“Generally, a state ‘is in no          
way harmed by issuance of an injunction that prevents the state           
from enforcing unconstitutional restrictions.’”). Conversely, NWS         
faces irreparable harm. Therefore, the balance of hardships favors        
Plaintiff.                                                                
 D. Public interest                                                      
    The public interest which the fourth factor refers to is “the        
public  interest  in  the  issuance  of the  injunction  itself.”         
Braintree Labs., Inc. v. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., 622 F.3d         
36, 45 n.8 (1st Cir. 2010)) (emphasis in original). When analyzing        

this factor, the Court looks towards “a fit (or lack of friction)         
between the injunction and the public interest.” NuVasive, Inc. v.        
Day, 954 F.3d 439, 443 (1st Cir. 2020). “Just as a government has         
no  interest  in  enforcing  an  unconstitutional  law,  the  public      
interest is harmed by the enforcement of laws repugnant to the            
United States Constitution.” Siembra Finca Carmen, LLC., 437 F.           
Supp. 3d at 137. Moreover, the public has a strong interest in            
avoiding shortages of key food items such as poultry products.            
Therefore, all four factors favor the issuance of a preliminary           
injunction.                                                               
                         V.   CONCLUSION                                 
    In sum, this is a case about whether Puerto Rico law can             
circumvent federally mandated common-sense advice on handling raw         

poultry  products.  Regulation  8,  Article  XIV(A)(6)’s  absolute        
prohibition of labeling “Keep refrigerated or frozen” is directly         
at odds with, and thus preempted by, the PPIA and regulations             
issued  thereunder.  Given  that  all  four  relevant  factors  favor     
Plaintiff, their request for a preliminary injunction at Docket           
No. 35 is GRANTED.                                                        
    Therefore, Defendants Ramón González-Beiró, Secretary of the         
Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, and Alex Muñiz-Lasalle, the        
Deputy Secretary of the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, as         
well as their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and        
any other persons who are in active concert or participation with         

them,  are  hereby  enjoined  from  enforcing  Article  XIV(A)(6)’s       
absolute  prohibition  of  labels  stating  “Keep  Refrigerated  or       
Frozen”  for  the  duration  of  this  litigation.  Accordingly,  all     
poultry products currently detained pursuant to said enforcement          
must be released.                                                         
    However,  both   Article  XIV(A)(4)-(5)   and  9   C.F.R  §          
381.129(b)(6)(i)-(ii)  prohibit  products  that  have  been  frozen       
(i.e., below a temperature of 26oF) from being labeled as fresh.          
While the PRDA cannot conclusively prohibit labels containing the         
phrase  “keep  refrigerated  or  frozen”  it  can  enforce  FSIS          
Regulations  prohibiting  false  and  misleading  advertising  of         
freshness. Thus, the preliminary injunction does not constitute a         
limitation on the PRDA’s enforcement of Regulation 8 provisions           

that are identical to federal regulations.                                
    Pursuant  to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65(c)  and  given  the  lack  of   
evidence of harm to the nonmovants, Plaintiff SHALL deposit a bond        
for the nominal amount of $1,000.00 as security with the Clerk of         
Court within five (5) days of entry of this Order.                        
    IT IS SO ORDERED.
