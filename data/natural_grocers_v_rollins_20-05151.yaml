reason_for_appeal: '=== Natural Grocers et al. (Plaintiffs-Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued under the APA that the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) acted contrary to law and arbitrarily and capriciously by excluding highly refined foods from the definition of "bioengineered food"—i.e., by providing that foods made with bioengineered ingredients are outside the disclosure requirement if the genetic material is not detectable under 7 C.F.R. § 66.9—and contended that the statute required disclosure for all such highly refined foods that may contain modified genetic material.

  2. Plaintiffs argued under the APA that the AMS acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and inconsistently with the amended Agricultural Marketing Act, by requiring that mandatory disclosures use only the term "bioengineered" and by refusing to require or allow more familiar terms such as "genetically engineered," "genetically modified organism," or "GMO" to satisfy the federal disclosure requirement.

  3. Plaintiffs argued under the APA that two disclosure-format regulations—7 C.F.R. § 66.106 (electronic or digital link/QR code option) and 7 C.F.R. § 66.108 (text-message disclosure option)—were unlawful because (a) after the statutory study showed that consumers lack sufficient access to disclosures via electronic or digital methods, the AMS was required to fix the deficiencies in the electronic/digital link option rather than leave it in place unchanged, and (b) the statute did not authorize the agency to create a freestanding fourth disclosure option (text messaging) beyond the three specified options of text, symbol, or electronic/digital link.

  4. Plaintiffs further contended that, having found §§ 66.106 and 66.108 unlawful, the district court erred in remanding those regulations to the agency without vacating them, and that the APA required vacatur (at least on a prospective basis) rather than remand without vacatur.'
