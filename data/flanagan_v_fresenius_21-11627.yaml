outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Martin Flanagan''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Flanagan argued that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failing to meet the heightened pleading standard under Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that his complaint satisfied the particularity required to assert fraud claims under the False Claims Act (FCA).

  2. Flanagan contended that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint, arguing that there was no undue delay or prejudice to the defendant and that he did not have the necessary claims data to amend until after the motion to dismiss was decided.

  3. Flanagan asserted that the district court should not have dismissed his claims for failing to sufficiently plead but-for causation under the FCA and Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), maintaining that his complaint adequately alleged causation or, alternatively, that but-for causation was not required.

  4. Flanagan argued that the district court failed to address his separate claims under 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1)(B) (false record or statement claims), contending that he sufficiently alleged that Fresenius made false records or statements material to false or fraudulent claims by falsely certifying compliance with the AKS and cost report requirements.

  5. Flanagan objected to the district court''s reliance on alternative grounds for dismissal, including failure to meet statutory requirements, the public-disclosure bar, and the first-to-file bar, to the extent those grounds affected the scope of his appeal.'
