                                           II.
                                   RELEVANT BACKGROUND

  A.      PROCEDURAL HISTORY

          On May 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint raising a single cause of action seeking
  declaratory judgment that Plaintiff’s trademark filing for the Nature’s Day mark does not infringe
  upon Defendant’s use and registration of its Nature’s Way mark. Dkt. 1.

         On June 29, 2023, the United States Supreme Court decided Abitron Austria GmbH v.
  Hetronic Int’l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412 (2023), holding the Lanham Act’s prohibition of unauthorized use
  in commerce of a protected trademark does not apply extraterritorially.

          On August 29, 2023, Defendant filed a Counterclaim for damages and injunctive relief
  against Plaintiff for its use of the Nature’s Day mark. Dkt. 28. Defendant-counterclaimant alleged
  the following causes of action:

          (1) Causes of Action One through Six: Trademark Infringement 1 in violation of 15
              U.S.C. § 1114(1);
          (2) Cause of Action Seven: False Designation and Unfair Competition in violation of 15
              U.S.C. § 1125(a);
          (3) Cause of Action Eight: Trademark Dilution in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c);
          (4) Cause of Action Nine: Unfair Business Practices in violation of Section 17200 of the
              California Business and Professions Code; and
          (5) Cause of Action Ten: Trademark Infringement and Unfair Competition in violation of
              California Common Law.

  Id.

          On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleging the
  following causes of action:

          (1) Cause of Action One: Declaratory Judgment of Non-Infringement under 15 U.S.C. §
              1114;
          (2) Cause of Action Two: Declaratory Judgment of Non-Infringement under 15 U.S.C. §
              1125(a);
          (3) Cause of Action Three: Declaratory Judgment of Non-Infringement under 15 U.S.C. §
              1125(c)
          (4) Cause of Action Four: Declaratory Judgment of Non-Infringement and No Unfair
              Business Practices under Section 17200 of the California Business and Professions Code;
              and

          1
           Cause of Action One: U.S. Trademark Registration No. 1,356,165; Cause of Action
  Two: U.S. Trademark Registration No. 1,400,087; Cause of Action Three: U.S. Trademark
  Registration No. 2,741,805; Cause of Action Four: U.S. Trademark Registration No. 4,317,153;
  Cause of Action Five: U.S. Trademark Registration No. 4,964,882; Cause of Action Six: U.S.
  Trademark Registration No. 5,863,985. Dkt. 28 ¶¶ 73-120.

          (5) Cause of Action Five: Declaratory Judgment of Non-Infringement and No Unfair
              Competition under California Common Law.

  Dkt. 30.

        On September 19, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer to the SAC, and Plaintiff filed an
  Answer to the Counterclaim. Dkts. 35, 36.

          On September 21, 2023, the parties submitted their Joint Rule 26(f) Report. Dkt. 37.
  Defendant provided a list of topics it expected to seek discovery on, including Plaintiff’s intent in
  adopting the Nature’s Day mark and Plaintiff’s representation that it had no plans to market,
  advertise, or sell products bearing the Nature’s Day mark in the United States. Id.

         On September 28, 2023, the Court issued its scheduling order, which set a deadline for all
  discovery to be completed by June 6, 2024 and motions to be heard by August 5, 2024. Dkt. 39.

          On October 23, 2023, the Court denied a Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed by
  Defendant finding “it appears that [Plaintiff] is using the Nature’s Day mark in the United States
  only to manufacture, label, and transport products bearing the mark to Asia.” Dkt. 44 at 2. Thus,
  the Court concluded Defendant cannot show it is likely to succeed on the merits or suffer
  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief because “there is no opportunity for a United
  States consumer to be confused, deceived, or mistaken” by supplements bearing Plaintiff’s Nature’s
  Day mark. Id. at 3-4.

  B.      THE INSTANT MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

         On December 28, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel “gave notice that it intended to move for
  summary judgment as to non-infringement, no dilution, and no unfair competition as a matter of
  law.” Dkt. 59-2, Supplemental Declaration of G. Warren Bleeker (“Suppl. Bleeker Decl.”), ¶ 5.

          On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Summary Judgment and Request
  for Judicial Notice. Dkts. 49, 50. Plaintiff argues (1) it is entitled to summary judgment on its
  corresponding causes of action for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and no unfair business
  practices and unfair competition under California law; and (2) Defendant’s counterclaims fail as a
  matter of law. Dkt. 49 at 2.

          On February 12, 2023, Defendant filed an Opposition and a Request for Judicial Notice.
  Dkt. 58. Among other arguments, Defendant claims the Motion should be denied as premature
  because discovery has not closed, “[t]here has been minimal discovery to-date by either party, and
  no depositions of [Plaintiff’s] declarants or any other witnesses.” Id. at 13-14. Defendant asserts it
  “endeavors to elicit” several facts, including “[w]hat knowledge [Plaintiff] had of the Nature’s Way
  marks when it adopted” Nature’s Day and how Plaintiff’s e-commerce platforms operate. Dkt. 58-
  2, Declaration of Aaron T. Olejniczak (“Olejniczak Decl.”), ¶ 9. Defendant claims this discovery is
  “pertinent to the issues involved” in the Motion, and is “essential for [Defendant] to oppose” the
  Motion. Id. ¶¶ 9, 10, 11. However, as of the date of the Opposition, Defendant had not
  “propound[ed] any discovery requests, serve[d] any deposition notices, or . . . request[ed] dates for
  depositions.” Suppl. Bleeker Decl. ¶ 6.

          On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Reply. Dkt. 59. This matter, thus, stands submitted.

                                              III.
                                          MATERIAL FACTS

          Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are uncontroverted. To the extent certain
  facts are not referenced in this Order, the Court has not relied on such facts in reaching its decision.
  In addition, the Court considers the parties’ evidentiary objections only where necessary. 2 All other
  objections are OVERRULED AS MOOT.

           Plaintiff is a “science-based nutritional supplement company,” based in Tustin, California.,
  that offers a “wide range of nutritional and dietary supplements,” including the instant Nature’s Day
  supplements. Dkt. 49-8, Plaintiff’s Statement of Uncontroverted Facts (“PSUF”), ¶ 1; dkt. 49-7,
  Declaration of Stacey Kato (“Kato Decl.”), ¶¶ 1, 4. Plaintiff “produces its Nature’s Day products . .
  . , including placing the Nature’s Day mark on the product or its containers[,] in the State of
  California.” Dkt. 58-4, Defendant’s Statement of Additional Uncontroverted Material Facts
  (“DSAUF”), ¶ 59; see dkt. 60, Plaintiff’s Response to Defendant’s Statement of Additional
  Uncontroverted Material Facts (“PRSAUF”), ¶ 59.

          Plaintiff “has made multiple bulk sales of Nature’s Day Supplements in Asia, and Nature’s
  Day Supplements are currently being sold in Hong Kong commerce.” PSUF ¶ 16; dkt. 49-6,
  Declaration of Peter Kim (“Kim Decl.”), ¶ 7. Plaintiff “transports or ships its products bearing the
  Nature’s Day mark . . . from its manufacturing facility in California.” DSAUF ¶ 60; see PRSAUF ¶
  60; dkt. 49-7, Kato Decl. ¶ 7; dkt. 49-1 at 13. Plaintiff “has not sold and does not intend to sell
  Nature’s Day Supplements in brick-and-mortar stores anywhere or to end consumers in the United
  States through any means.” PSUF ¶ 12; Kim Decl. ¶¶ 9-11. Plaintiff “has not advertised or
  marketed its Nature’s Day Supplement in the United States.” PSUF ¶ 18; Kim Decl. ¶ 12. Plaintiff
  “has no intention of advertising its Nature’s Day Supplements on its websites or social media
  accounts in the United States.” PSUF ¶ 14; Kim Decl. ¶ 12. Plaintiff “is unaware of any actual
  confusion that has occurred between it and Defendant’s respective goods.” PSUF ¶ 31; Kato Decl.
  ¶ 9.

         Defendant is a “dietary supplement brand[]” that advertises and sells vitamins and
  supplements “through distributors and retailers to consumers in all 50 states.” Dkt. 29-3,
  Declaration of Andrew Hartshorn (“Hartshorn Decl.”), ¶¶ 4, 5, 13; DSAUF ¶ 43; PRSAUF ¶ 43.

         On November 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed an application for a U.S. Federal Trademark for
  Nature’s Day, 3 covering a dietary and nutritional supplement product line that it had recently
  developed. PSUF ¶¶ 2-4; dkt. 58-4, Defendant’s Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact

          2
           “[O]bjections to evidence on the ground that it is irrelevant, speculative, and/or
  argumentative, or that it constitutes an improper legal conclusion are all duplicative of the summary
  judgment standard itself[.]” Burch v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 433 F. Supp. 2d 1110, 1119 (E.D.
  Cal. 2006). The Court declines to address such objections.
         Plaintiff owns U.S. Federal Trademark Application Serial No. 97/676,848. PSUF ¶ 4,
          3

  DSDF ¶ 4.

  (“DSDF”), ¶¶ 2-4. The Notice of Publication states the “mark appears to be entitled to register on
  the Principal Register,” and is scheduled to publish on February 6, 2024. PSUF ¶ 4; DSDF ¶ 4.
  Plaintiff additionally “owns Madrid International Trademark Reg. No. 1,723,828 for Nature’s Day,”
  which is “based on” the U.S. Federal Trademark Application and “has designations to the European
  Union, China, and Japan under the Madrid Protocol.” PSUF ¶ 5; DSDF ¶ 5.

          On April 20, 2023, Defendant sent Plaintiff a cease-and-desist letter regarding Plaintiff’s use
  of the Nature’s Day mark and demanded Plaintiff “expressly abandon its trademark applications
  worldwide.” DSAUF ¶ 47; PRSAUF ¶ 47.

                                              IV.
                                         LEGAL STANDARD

          Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party “shows that there is no genuine
  dispute as to any material fact” and the moving party “is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”
  FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a). A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit[.]” Nat’l Ass’n
  of Optometrists & Opticians v. Harris, 682 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v.
  Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). A dispute of material fact is “genuine” if “the
  evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson,
  477 U.S. at 248.

           The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of production by
  “producing evidence, or showing the absence of evidence, on the motion for summary judgment[.]”
  Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Companies, Inc., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000). “[T]he
  ultimate burden of persuasion can refer either to the burden of persuasion on the motion or to the
  burden of persuasion at trial.” Id. A moving party without the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial
  “must either produce evidence negating an essential element of the nonmoving party’s claim or
  defense or show that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element to
  carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.” Id. “[T]o carry its ultimate burden of persuasion on
  the motion, the moving party must” establish “there is no genuine issue of material fact.” Id.

           If the moving party meets its initial burden of production, the burden then shifts to the non-
  moving party to “go beyond the pleadings” and “designate specific facts showing that there is a
  genuine issue for trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P.
  56(e)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The non-moving party “must do more than simply show
  that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.
  Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). The non-moving party “cannot manufacture a
  genuine issue of material fact merely by making assertions in its legal memoranda.” S. A. Empresa
  De Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines) v. Walter Kidde & Co., 690 F.2d 1235, 1238 (9th
  Cir. 1982).

          In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view all inferences drawn from
  the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus.
  Co., 475 U.S. at 587. Summary judgment is, therefore, not proper “where contradictory inferences
  may reasonably be drawn from undisputed evidentiary facts[.]” Hollingsworth Solderless Terminal
  Co. v. Turley, 622 F.2d 1324, 1335 (9th Cir. 1980). Furthermore, the court does not make credibility
  determinations with respect to the evidence offered. See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec.
  Contractors Ass’n, 809 F.2d 626, 630-31 (9th Cir. 1987).

                                        V.
               PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS GRANTED

  A.      DEFENDANT’S REQUEST TO DENY THE MOTION AS PREMATURE
          UNDER FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 56(d) IS DENIED

          1.      Applicable Law

           If a party has not had sufficient time and opportunity for discovery, the party may request
  deferral or denial of the motion for summary judgment. See FED. R. CIV. P. 56(d). To warrant
  deferral or denial, the requesting party “must show: (1) it has set forth in affidavit form the specific
  facts it hopes to elicit from further discovery; (2) the facts sought exist; and (3) the sought-after facts
  are essential to oppose summary judgment.” Fam. Home & Finance Ctr. v. Fed. Home Loan
  Mortgage Corp., 525 F.3d 822, 827 (9th Cir. 2008). “[T[he evidence sought must be more than ‘the
  object of pure speculation.’” Stevens v. Corelogic, Inc., 899 F.3d 666, 678 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting
  California v. Campbell, 138 F.3d 772, 779-80 (9th Cir. 1998)); Apache Survival Coal. v. United
  States, 21 F.3d 895, 911 n.17 (9th Cir. 1994) (“Even if Appellants otherwise were entitled to
  discovery, it was within the district court’s discretion to deny it when, as in this case, the
  complaining party could only speculate as to what it might discover.”). “Failure to comply with
  these requirements ‘is a proper ground for denying discovery and proceeding to summary
  judgment.’” Fam. Home & Finance Ctr., 525 F.3d at 827 (quoting Campbell, 138 F.3d at 779).

          Moreover, even if the requesting party makes an adequate factual showing, “the failure to
  conduct discovery diligently is grounds for the denial of a [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d)]
  motion.” Pfingston v. Ronan Eng’g Co., 284 F.3d 999, 1005 (9th Cir. 2002); see Mackey v. Pioneer
  Nat’l Bank, 867 F.2d 520, 524 (9th Cir. 1989) (“A movant cannot complain if it fails diligently to
  pursue discovery before summary judgment.”); Landmark Dev. Corp. v. Chambers Corp., 752 F.2d
  369, 372 (9th Cir. 1985) (concluding that court properly denied request to permit further discovery
  before ruling on the motion for summary judgment because the “[f]ailure to take further depositions
  apparently resulted largely from plaintiffs’ own delay”).

          2.      Analysis

           Here, Defendant has failed to establish denial of or deferral of a ruling on the Motion is
  warranted. First, while Defendant submits a declaration from counsel listing the “specific facts it
  hopes to elicit from further discovery,” Defendant fails to provide a basis to conclude the facts
  sought exist. For example, the declaration only conclusorily claims “[u]pon information and belief,
  the facts [Defendant] seeks exist” and these facts “are essential to oppose [the Motion].” Olejniczak
  Decl. ¶¶ 10, 11. Additionally, Defendant fails to explain why it believes certain facts Defendant
  seeks exist. For example, Defendant fails to provide information to contradict “[w]hether [Plaintiff]
  is aware of any instances of actual confusion,” Olejniczak Decl. ¶ 9, when Plaintiff has already
  submitted a declaration from its CFO that Plaintiff “is unaware of any actual confusion that has
  occurred between it and Defendant’s respective goods.” Kato Decl. ¶ 9. Thus, Defendant has
  failed to carry its burden to establish that denial or deferral is warranted under Rule 56(d).

           Second, even if Defendant had carried its burden, Defendant has failed to conduct discovery
  diligently in this matter. See Pfingston, 284 F.3d at 1005. Defendant sent its cease-and-desist letter
   Page 6 of 12                        CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL                       Initials of Deputy Clerk NP
Case 8:23-cv-00766-KK-KES Document 65 Filed 03/29/24 Page 7 of 12 Page ID #:4105



  on April 20, 2023, and this case has been pending since May 2, 2023. Dkt. 1. Defendant filed its
  Counterclaim on August 29, 2023, and discovery has been ongoing since at least September 21,
  2023. Dkts. 28, 37. Notably, during this time, Defendant failed to conduct any discovery. As of
  February 2024, weeks after the Motion was filed, Defendant still had not “propound[ed] any
  discovery requests, serve[d] any deposition notices, or . . . request[ed] dates for depositions.” Suppl.
  Bleeker Decl. ¶ 6.

          Therefore, Defendant has had more than sufficient time and notice of any information it
  needed to seek in discovery, but has failed to conduct discovery diligently. Based on this record,
  Defendant’s request to deny or defer ruling on the Motion until discovery is closed is denied. See
  Rosebud LMS Inc. v. Adobe Sys. Inc., 812 F.3d 1070, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (finding no abuse of
  discretion in granting summary judgment before close of discovery where plaintiff had notice of
  intent to file and did not oppose filing of early dispositive motion and did not serve deposition
  notices or subpoenas until several weeks after motion filed).

  B.      PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON DEFENDANT’S
          COUNTERCLAIMS FOR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, FALSE
          DESIGNATION, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND UNFAIR BUSINESS
          PRACTICES

          1.      Plaintiff’s Act of Manufacturing, Labeling, and Transporting the Nature’s
                  Day Supplements in the United States Qualifies as Use in Commerce Under
                  the Lanham Act

                  a.      Applicable Law

          “It is a longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary
  intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.”
  Morrison v. Nat’l Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 255 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).
  Furthering this principle is a “presumption against extraterritoriality” – specifically, a “presumption
  against application [of United States law] to conduct in the territory of another sovereign.” Kiobel
  v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 119 (2013).

          “Applying the presumption against extraterritoriality involves ‘a two-step framework.’”
  Abitron Austria GmbH, 600 U.S. at 417 (quoting RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community, 579
  U.S. 325, 337 (2016)). First, a court must “determine whether a provision is extraterritorial, and that
  determination turns on whether ‘Congress has affirmatively and unmistakably instructed that’ the
  provision at issue should ‘apply to foreign conduct.’” Id. at 417-18 (quoting RJR Nabisco, Inc., 579
  U.S. at 335, 337). Second, if the provision is not extraterritorial, then the court must determine
  “whether the suit seeks a (permissible) domestic or (impermissible) foreign application of the
  provision.” Id. at 418. “To make that determination, courts must start by identifying the focus of
  congressional concern underlying the provision at issue.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation
  omitted). Thus, “[w]hen a claim involves both domestic and foreign activity, the question is whether
  the conduct relevant to the statute’s focus occurred in the United States.” Id. at 424 (internal
  quotation marks omitted); Nestle USA, Inc. v. Doe, 593 U.S. 628, 633 (2021)).

          The Supreme Court held that the Lanham Act is “not extraterritorial” and that the Act’s
  regulation of “‘use in commerce’ is the conduct” of congressional concern. Abitron Austria GmbH,

  600 U.S. at 422, 423 (quoting 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1)(a), 1125(a)(1)). Under the Lanham Act, “a mark
  shall be deemed to be in use in commerce on goods when it is placed in any manner on the goods or
  their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, . . . and
  the goods are sold or transported in commerce . . . .” 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Thus, while any conduct
  outside of the United States is not actionable under the Lanham Act, if the alleged “use in
  commerce” “occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application
  of the statute, even if other conduct occurred abroad.” Abitron Austria GmbH, 600 U.S. at 424
  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

                  b.      Analysis

          Here, Plaintiff’s conduct in the United States is limited to manufacturing, bottling, labeling,
  and transporting its Nature’s Day branded supplements. DSAUF ¶¶ 59, 60; see PRSAUF ¶¶ 59, 60;
  Kato Decl. ¶ 7; dkt. 49-1 at 13. Under the Lanham Act, this qualifies as a “use in commerce” as a
  result of its “transport[]” throughout the United States. See 15 U.S.C. § 1127. Thus, Plaintiff’s
  domestic conduct and use of the Nature’s Day mark is actionable under the Lanham Act. However,
  such conduct is actionable under the Lanham Act to the extent that it is likely to cause consumer
  confusion.

          2.      Plaintiff’s Domestic Use of the Nature’s Day Mark Does Not Violate the
                  Lanham Act as Trademark Infringement Because Plaintiff’s Use of the Mark
                  Is Not Likely to Cause Consumer Confusion

                  a.      Applicable Law

          To prevail on a claim of trademark infringement, a party must establish that (1) it has a valid,
  protectable mark, and (2) the infringing party’s use of the mark is likely to cause consumer
  confusion. Applied Info. Scis. Corp. v. eBAY, Inc., 511 F.3d 966, 969 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing
  Brookfield Commc’ns, Inc. v. W. Coast Ent. Corp., 174 F.3d 1036, 1053 (9th Cir. 1999)). In
  considering likelihood of confusion, courts evaluate the Sleekcraft factors: (1) the strength of the
  mark; (2) proximity or relatedness of the goods; (3) similarity of the marks; (4) evidence of actual
  confusion; (5) marketing channels used; (6) type of goods and the degree of care likely to be
  exercised by the purchaser; (7) the defendant’s intent in selecting the mark; and (8) the likelihood of
  expansion of the product lines. JL Beverage Co., LLC v. Jim Beam Brands Co., 828 F.3d 1098, 1106
  (9th Cir. 2016); AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979), abrogated on
  other grounds by Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mountain Prods., 353 F.3d 792 (9th Cir. 2003). “[T]his
  eight-factor test for likelihood of confusion is pliant.” Brookfield Commc’ns, 174 F.3d at 1054.
  “Some factors are much more important than others,” and “it is often possible to reach a conclusion
  with respect to likelihood of confusion after considering only a subset of the factors.” Id.

                  b.      Analysis

           Here, Plaintiff has presented evidence that it “has not sold and does not intend to sell
  Nature’s Day Supplements in brick-and-mortar stores anywhere or to end consumers in the United
  States[.]” PSUF ¶ 12; Kim Decl. ¶¶ 9-11. Plaintiff has additionally presented evidence that it “has
  not advertised or marketed its Nature’s Day Supplement in the United States,” and it does not
  intend to change either of these practices. PSUF ¶¶ 14, 18; Kim Decl. ¶ 12. Defendant has not
  presented any evidence to contradict these claims, despite having at least five months to conduct
   Page 8 of 12                       CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL                      Initials of Deputy Clerk NP

  discovery. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 585-86 (holding a party opposing summary judgment is required
  to tender evidence of specific facts in support of his contention that a dispute exists). Thus, there is
  no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff’s only use in commerce under the Lanham Act is its
  transport of its Nature’s Day branded supplements from its manufacturing facility to its consumers
  in Asia. Defendant has not presented any evidence to show Plaintiff sells, advertises, or otherwise
  interacts with any of Defendant’s consumers, let alone United States consumers. See Brookfield
  Commc’ns, 174 F.3d at 1056 (“If . . . [the parties] did not compete to any extent whatsoever, the
  likelihood of confusion would probably be remote.”); Therma-Scan, Inc. v. Thermoscan, Inc., 295
  F.3d 623, 636 (6th Cir. 2002) (“Where the parties have different customers and market their goods
  or services in different ways, the likelihood of confusion decreases.”). Defendant additionally has
  not cited to any cases where the transport of a product alone without any advertising or promoting
  of the marked good is likely to cause consumer confusion.

           In evaluating the Sleekcraft factors, there is no genuine issue of material fact that consumer
  confusion between Nature’s Day supplements and Nature’s Way supplements is not likely. First,
  there is no evidence in the record of actual confusion by consumers between the Nature’s Day and
  Nature’s Way supplements. Plaintiff presented a declaration from its CFO that Plaintiff was
  unaware of any actual confusion, and Defendant has failed to present any evidence to the contrary.
  PSUF ¶ 31; Kato Decl. ¶ 9. Thus, based on the record, there is no genuine issue of material fact that
  actual confusion of consumers does not exist. Accordingly, this factor – evidence of actual
  consumer confusion – weighs against a finding that Plaintiff’s use of the Nature’s Day mark is likely
  to cause consumer confusion. JL Beverage Co., LLC, 828 F.3d at 1106.

           Second, as to marketing channels, “[c]onvergent marketing channels increase the likelihood
  of confusion.” Nutri/Sys., Inc. v. Con-Stan Indus., Inc., 809 F.2d 601, 606 (9th Cir. 1987). “In
  assessing marketing channel convergence, courts consider whether the parties’ customer bases
  overlap and how the parties advertise and market their products.” Pom Wonderful LLC v.
  Hubbard, 775 F.3d 1118, 1130 (9th Cir. 2014). Here, Plaintiff has presented evidence that it “has
  not advertised or marketed its Nature’s Day Supplement in the United States,” nor does Plaintiff
  have any “intention of advertising its Nature’s Day Supplements on its websites or social media
  accounts in the United States.” PSUF ¶ 14; Kim Decl. ¶ 12. Defendant has not presented any
  evidence to the contrary. Thus, there is no evidence and no genuine issue of material fact that the
  marketing channels used by Plaintiff are not likely to cause consumer confusion in the United States.
  See Bias v. Moynihan, 508 F.3d 1212, 1219 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that “[b]ecause [the non-moving
  party] failed to present any evidence in opposition to [the] motion for summary judgment, [the non-
  moving party] has failed to demonstrate that there are any genuine issues of material facts in
  dispute). Accordingly, this factor – marketing channels used – weighs against a finding that
  Plaintiff’s use of the Nature’s Day mark is likely to cause consumer confusion. JL Beverage Co.,
  LLC, 828 F.3d at 1106.

           Third, as to likelihood of expansion of product lines, “a ‘strong possibility’ that either party
  may expand [their] business to compete with the other will weigh in favor of finding that the present
  use is infringing.” Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d at 354. Here, Plaintiff has presented evidence that it
  “does not intend to sell Nature’s Day Supplements in brick-and-mortar stores anywhere or to end
  consumers in the United States through any means.” PSUF ¶ 12; Kim Decl. ¶¶ 9-11. Defendant
  has not presented any evidence to the contrary. Thus, there is no evidence and no genuine issue of
  material fact that Plaintiff does not intend to expand its product lines to compete with Defendant in
  the United States. Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 585-86; Bias, 508 F.3d at 1219. Accordingly, this factor –
   Page 9 of 12                        CIVIL MINUTES—GENERAL                     Initials of Deputy Clerk NP
Case 8:23-cv-00766-KK-KES Document 65 Filed 03/29/24 Page 10 of 12 Page ID #:4108



  likelihood of expansion of product lines – weighs against a finding that Plaintiff’s use of the Nature’s
  Day mark is likely to cause consumer confusion. JL Beverage Co., LLC, 828 F.3d at 1106.

           As to the remaining five factors – the strength of the mark, proximity or relatedness of the
  goods, similarity of the marks, type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the
  purchaser, and the defendant’s intent in selecting the mark – the Court finds these factors are less
  relevant in light of the absence of any sales, advertising, or other interaction with United States
  consumers and the fact that Plaintiff advertises and sells only to consumers abroad. Brookfield
  Commc’ns, Inc., 174 F.3d at 1054 (“Even where there is precise identity of a complainant’s and an
  alleged infringer’s mark, there may be no consumer confusion – and thus no trademark infringement
  – if the alleged infringer is in a different geographic area . . . .”).

          Accordingly, based on the record, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff’s
  use of the Nature’s Day mark for its transport in commerce is not likely to cause consumer
  confusion. Because there is no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff’s use of the Nature’s Day
  mark is not likely to cause consumer confusion, Plaintiff use of the mark does not constitute
  trademark infringement as a matter of law.

          3.       Plaintiff Is Entitled to Summary Judgment on Defendant’s Remaining Claims
                   of False Designation of Origin, Unfair Competition, and Unfair Business
                   Practices in Light of the Absence of Consumer Confusion

          To prevail on a claim of false designation of origin under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), a plaintiff
  must show that “(1) defendant uses a designation (any word, term, name, device, or any combination
  thereof) or false designation of origin; (2) the use was in interstate commerce; (3) the use was in
  connection with goods or services; (4) the designation or false designation is likely to cause
  confusion, mistake, or deception as to (a) the affiliation, connection, or association of defendant
  with another person, or (b) as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of defendant’s goods, services,
  or commercial activities by another person; and (5) plaintiff has been or is likely to be damaged by
  these acts.” Summit Tech., Inc. v. High-Line Med. Instruments, Co., 933 F. Supp. 918, 928 (C.D.
  Cal. 1996); Zamfir v. Casperlabs, LLC, 528 F. Supp. 3d 1136, 1143 (S.D. Cal. 2021) (same).

          In the Ninth Circuit, courts have consistently held that Lanham Act false designation of
  origin claims and state and federal unfair competition claims predicated upon alleged infringement
  are subject to the same analysis as Lanham Act trademark infringement claims. See Cleary v. News
  Corp., 30 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir. 1994) (“This Circuit has consistently held that state common
  law claims of unfair competition and actions pursuant to California Business and Professions Code §
  17200 are ‘substantially congruent’ to claims made under the Lanham Act.”); New W. Corp. v. NYM
  Co. of California, 595 F.2d 1194, 1201 (9th Cir. 1979) (“The courts have uniformly held that
  common law and statutory trade-mark infringements are merely specific aspects of unfair
  competition.”); Brookfield Commc’ns, Inc., 174 F.3d at 1046 n.8 (holding “the analysis [of
  trademark infringement and false designation of origin claims] is oftentimes identical”); Grupo
  Gigante SA De CV v. Dallo & Co., 391 F.3d 1088, 1100 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[T]rademark claims under
  California law are ‘substantially congruent’ with federal claims and thus lend themselves to the same
  analysis.”).

Case 8:23-cv-00766-KK-KES Document 65 Filed 03/29/24 Page 11 of 12 Page ID #:4109



         Here, because Defendant’s claim of trademark infringement fails, Defendant’s claims of false
  designation of origin and unfair competition under the Lanham Act and unfair business practices
  and unfair competition under California law also fail for the same reasons.

  C.      PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON DEFENDANT’S
          COUNTERCLAIM FOR TRADEMARK DILUTION

           To prove a claim for dilution under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c), a claimant “must show that (1) the
  mark is famous and distinctive; (2) the [other party] is making use of the mark in commerce; (3) the
  [other party’s] use began after the mark became famous; and (4) the [other party’s] use of the mark is
  likely to cause dilution by blurring[.]” 4 Jada Toys, Inc. v. Mattel, Inc., 518 F.3d 628, 634 (9th Cir.
  2008). “[T]he question is whether the ‘association arising from the similarity between a mark or
  trade name and a famous mark . . . impairs the distinctiveness of the famous mark.’” Id. at 635.
  Courts consider the following six factors when making this determination: (1) the degree of
  similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark; (2) the degree of inherent or
  acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark; (3) the extent to which the owner of the famous mark
  is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark; (4) the degree of recognition of the famous
  mark; (5) whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the
  famous mark; (6) any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark. Id.
  at 636.

           Here, there is no genuine issue of material fact that Plaintiff’s use of the Nature’s Day mark
  is not likely to cause dilution by blurring. First, there is no actual association between Nature’s Day
  and Nature’s Way because Nature’s Day is not sold or advertised in the United States – only abroad.
  As discussed above, Plaintiff has presented evidence it “has not sold and does not intend to sell
  Nature’s Day Supplements in brick-and-mortar stores anywhere or to end consumers in the United
  States[.]” PSUF ¶ 12; Kim Decl. ¶¶ 9-11. Plaintiff has additionally presented evidence that it “has
  not advertised or marketed its Nature’s Day Supplement in the United States,” and it does not
  intend to change either of these practices. PSUF ¶¶ 14, 18; Kim Decl. ¶ 12. Defendant has not only
  failed to present any evidence to create a dispute, Defendant appears to concede, at the time it filed
  its Opposition, it merely “believes that [Plaintiff’s] intent in adopting the Nature’s Day mark is to
  create an association with the well-established Nature’s Way marks[.]” Dkt. 58 at 28 (emphasis
  added). This mere speculation unsupported by any evidence is insufficient to defeat summary
  judgment. Taylor v. List, 880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir. 1989) (“A summary judgment motion
  cannot be defeated by relying solely on conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data.”); Shane
  v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., 868 F.2d 1057, 1061 (9th Cir. 1989) (“Because the affidavit contains only
  conclusory allegations, not backed up by statements of fact, it cannot defeat a motion for summary
  judgment.”).

           Thus, Plaintiff has established Defendant will not be able to prove one of its necessary
  elements – namely that Plaintiff’s use of the mark is likely to cause dilution by blurring. Therefore,
  Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is granted as to Defendant’s claim for trademark dilution.



          4
           Defendant states it is pursuing dilution by blurring only and not dilution by tarnishment.
  See dkt. 58 at 27.

                                         CONCLUSION

          For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.

          IT IS SO ORDERED.
