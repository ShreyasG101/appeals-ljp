reason_for_appeal: '=== Ernst Jacob GmbH & Co. KG and Shipowners Insurance & Guaranty Company, Ltd.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the United States on liability under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) because the United States failed to prove that the natural resources at issue were ''belonging to, managed by, controlled by, or appertaining to the United States'' as required by 33 U.S.C. § 2706(a), and that the court failed to address this statutory standing element.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court erred by applying an arbitrary-and-capricious standard of review to the Federal On-Scene Coordinator''s (FOSC) ''substantial threat'' determination, rather than requiring the United States to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the vessel posed a substantial threat of a discharge of oil as an element of liability under OPA.

  3. Appellants argued that the district court improperly granted summary judgment before allowing discovery, despite genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether the FOSC made a ''substantial threat'' determination and whether such a threat existed.

  4. Appellants asserted that, even if the FOSC''s determination were relevant, the district court should have applied de novo review rather than arbitrary-and-capricious review because the agency''s factfinding was inadequate and such deference would violate due process.

  5. Appellants claimed that, under the Federal Relations Act, the natural resources in question are exclusively managed by Puerto Rico, precluding United States liability for damages to those resources under OPA.'
