outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Little Hearts Marks Family II L.P.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in dismissing its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, contending these were direct claims based on its own contractual rights under the Operating Agreement and not derivative of the company’s rights.

  2. Appellant contended that it had individual contractual rights to use, occupy, develop, and acquire specific units in the building (the ''Marks Units''), and that the lower courts incorrectly found these rights were not distinct from its general investment in the company.

  3. Appellant argued that the lower courts erred in holding that its claims for breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty were derivative and could only be asserted by the creditor trustee, asserting that these claims were based on duties owed directly to it.

  4. Appellant contended that its unjust enrichment claim should not have been dismissed as duplicative of the contract claims, maintaining that it stated a separate and viable cause of action.

  5. Appellant argued that the bankruptcy court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over its direct claims and that the case should be remanded to state court.'
