outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Brian Fischer, Anthony J. Annucci, and Terrence X. Tracy (Defendants-Appellants-Cross-Appellees)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Defendants argued that the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of legal and administrative impediments that prevented them from unilaterally initiating a resentencing proceeding for Santiago during the 2007-08 period.

  2. Defendants contended that the exclusion of this evidence prejudiced their defense, particularly with respect to the jury''s award of punitive damages.

  3. Defendants asserted that the district court erred by denying their motion for a new trial related to Santiago’s incarceration in 2007-08.

  4. Defendants challenged the denial of qualified immunity for the 2007-08 period, arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity in connection with the enforcement of post-release supervision terms not separately pronounced at sentencing.


  === Jesus Santiago (Plaintiff-Appellee-Cross-Appellant)''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. Santiago argued that the district court erred in holding that the defendants acted reasonably in 2010 and could not be liable for damages for his incarceration from September to December 2010.

  2. Santiago contended that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to the defendants on his claims related to his incarceration in 2010 on the basis of qualified immunity.'
