UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

KENNETH M. KARAS, District Judge:                                         

                          I.  Background                                 
    Pro se Plaintiff Ernst Theodore Tenemille (“Plaintiff”) brought this Action against former 
Town of Ramapo Supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence (“St. Lawrence”), former Councilman 
Patrick Withers (“Withers”), Chief of Police Bradley R. Weidel (“Weidel”), Chief of Staff 
Thomas Cokeley (“Cokeley”), Squad Lieutenant Daniel Hyman (“Hyman”), Squad Sergeant 
Salomon Matos (“Matos”), Desk Sergeant Christopher Franklin (“Franklin”; collectively, the 
“Individual Defendants”), and the Town of Ramapo (the “Town” or “Ramapo”; together with 
Individual Defendants, “Defendants”), alleging that Defendants discriminated against and 
subsequently retaliated against him on the basis of his race, color, national origin, and religion, in 
violation of Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“§ 1983”), Title VII 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq.; and New York State 
Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”), N.Y. Exec. Law §§ 290, et seq.  (See generally Fourth Am. 
Compl. (“Fourth AC”) (Dkt. No. 88).)  On January 13, 2022, the Court issued an Opinion & 

Order granting Moving Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, which dismissed all claims with 
prejudice save for Plaintiff’s hostile work environment claims, which the Court dismissed 
without prejudice, as it was Plaintiff’s first adjudication of these claims on the merits.  (Op. & 
Order 33 (“2022 Op.”) (Dkt. No. 109).)  In its Opinion & Order, Court also permitted Plaintiff to 
file a fifth amended complaint within 30 days.  (Id. at 33–34.)1          
    Thirty days after the Court issued its Opinion & Order, Plaintiff, in lieu of a fifth 
amended complaint, filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court’s Opinion & Order pursuant 
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), (the “Motion”), as well as supporting papers.  (See Dkt. 
Nos. 110–112.)2  On March 25, 2022, Defendants filed a Memorandum of Law in Opposition to 
the Motion.  (Defs.’ Mem. of Law in Opp. to Pl.’s Mot. (“Defs.’ Mem.”) (Dkt. No. 115).)  

Finally, on April 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Reply.  (Pl.’s Reply Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. 
(“Pl.’s Reply Mem.”) (Dkt. No. 117).)                                     
    For the following reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion is denied.             



    1 The Court assumes the Parties’ familiarity with the facts at issue as well as the Action’s 
procedural history, up to and including the substance of that Opinion.  (See generally 2022 Op.)   

    2 Plaintiff first filed his Notice of Motion and his Memorandum of Law in Support of the 
Motion simultaneously but absent exhibits, (see generally Dkt. No. 110), then re-filed the same 
documents with exhibits, (see generally Dkt. No. 111).  Subsequently, Plaintiff re-filed three 
exhibits.  (See generally Dkt. No. 112.)  For purposes of this Opinion, the Court refers to Dkt. 
No. 110 as the “Motion” and to Dkt. No. 111 as Plaintiff’s Memorandum of Law (“Pl.’s Mem.”). 
                          II.  Discussion                                
    A.  Standard of Review                                               
    “Motions for reconsideration are governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 
Local Civil Rule 6.3, which are meant to ensure the finality of decisions and to prevent the 

practice of a losing party examining a decision and then plugging the gaps of a lost motion with 
additional matters.”  Arthur Glick Truck Sales, Inc. v. Stuphen E. Corp, 965 F. Supp. 2d 402, 404 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citation omitted), aff’d, 577 F. App’x 11 (2d Cir. 2014). The standard for such 
motions is “strict” and “should not be granted where the moving party seeks solely to relitigate 
an issue already decided.”  Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir. 1995); see 
also In re Gen. Motors LLC Ignition Switch Litig., No. 14-MD-2543, 2017 WL 3443623, at *1 
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2017) (“It is well established that the rules permitting motions for 
reconsideration must be narrowly construed and strictly applied so as to avoid repetitive 
arguments on issues that have been considered fully by the [c]ourt.” (citation and omitted)).  A 
movant may not “rely upon facts, issues, or arguments that were previously available but not 

presented to the court.”  Indergit v. Rite Aid Corp., 52 F. Supp. 3d 522, 523 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).  
Therefore, “[a] motion for reconsideration is not the proper avenue for the submission of new 
material.”  Sys. Mgmt. Arts Inc. v. Avesta Techs., Inc., 106 F. Supp. 2d 519, 521 (S.D.N.Y. 
2000).  “Rather, to be entitled to reconsideration, a movant must demonstrate that the [c]ourt 
overlooked controlling decisions or factual matters that were put before it on the underlying 
motion, which, had they been considered might reasonably have altered the result reached by the 
court.”  Arthur Glick, 965 F. Supp. 2d at 405 (citation omitted); Shrader, 70 F.3d at 257 (same).  
In other words, “[a] motion for reconsideration should be granted only when the [movant] 
identifies an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need 
to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.”  Alvarez v. City of New York, No. 11-CV-
5464, 2017 WL 6033425, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2017) (quoting Kolel Beth Yechiel Mechil of 
Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 2013)); see also Indergit, 52 F. 
Supp. 3d at 523.                                                          

    B.  Analysis                                                         
         1.  Rule 59(e)                                                  
    “To invoke Rule 59(e) to alter or amend a judgment, the moving party must move ‘no 
later than 28 days after entry of judgment.’”  Darcelin v. New York, No. 09-CV-5611, 2010 WL 
723455, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2010) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e)).  Plaintiff filed his 
motion 30 days after the entry of judgment.  (See Dkt.)  “[T]he liberal treatment afforded to pro 
se litigants does not exempt a pro se party from compliance with relevant rules of procedural and 
substantive law.”  Bell v. Jendell, 980 F. Supp. 2d 555, 559 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quotation marks 
omitted); see also Caidor v. Onondaga County, 517 F.3d 601, 605 (2d Cir. 2008) (“[P]ro se 
litigants generally are required to inform themselves regarding procedural rules and to comply 

with them.” (italics and citation omitted)).  Accordingly, the Court cannot waive Congress’ 
imposition of the 28-day time limit.3                                     


    3 Additionally, Local Civil Rule 6.3, entitled Motions for Reconsideration or 
Reargument, provides:                                                     

    [A] notice of motion for reconsideration . . . of a court order determining a motion 
    shall be served within fourteen (14) days after the entry of the Court’s determination 
    of the original motion, or in the case of a court order resulting in a judgment, within 
    fourteen (14) days after the entry of the judgment.  There shall be served with the 
    notice of motion a memorandum setting forth concisely the matters or controlling 
    decisions which counsel believes the Court has overlooked.           

Local Civ. R. 6.3.  In other words, Plaintiff failed to comply with local rules regarding Motions 
for Reconsideration in addition to the Federal Rules.                     
    The Court will nevertheless exercise its authority to “ignore the legal label that a pro se 
litigant attaches to a motion and recharacterize the motion in order to place it within a different 
legal category . . . to avoid an unnecessary dismissal.”  Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 
381 (2003) (italics omitted); see also Lora v. O’Heaney, 602 F.3d 106, 111 (2d Cir. 2010) (“An 

untimely motion for reconsideration [under Rule 59(e)] is treated as a Rule 60(b) motion.”); 
Munn v. APF Mgmt. Co., No. 19-CV-10791, 2021 WL 2355308, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2021) 
(“[S]everal courts in this Circuit have construed untimely motions for reconsideration under Rule 
59(e) or Local Civil Rule 6.3 as motions brought under Rule 60(b).” (quoting McGraw-Hill 
Glob. Educ. Holdings, LLC v. Mathrani, 293 F. Supp. 3d 394, 397 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 2018))).  Thus, 
the Court will consider the instant Motion under Rule 60(b).              
         2.  Rule 60(b)                                                  
    Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs relief from a final judgment 
or order.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).                                     
    On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative 
    from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: 
         (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;      
         (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable diligence, could not 
         have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);  
         (3)  fraud  (whether  previously  called  intrinsic  or  extrinsic), 
         misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;          
         (4) the judgment is void;                                       
         (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on 
         an  earlier  judgment  that  has  been  reversed  or  vacated;  or  applying  it 
         prospectively is no longer equitable; or                        
         (6) any other reason that justifies relief.                     
Id.                                                                       
    “Properly applied[,] Rule 60(b) strikes a balance between serving the ends of justice and 
preserving the finality of judgments.”  Nemaizer v. Baker, 793 F.2d 58, 61 (2d Cir. 1986).  “In 
other words[,] it should be broadly construed to do substantial justice, yet final judgments should 
not be lightly reopened.”  Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted). “Rule 60(b) provides a 

mechanism for extraordinary judicial relief available only if the moving party demonstrates 
exceptional circumstances, and relief under the rule is discretionary.” Motorola Credit Corp. v. 
Uzan, 561 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2009) (citation, quotation marks, and alteration omitted); see 
also Mendell ex rel. Viacom, Inc. v. Gollust, 909 F.2d 724, 731 (2d Cir. 1990) (“Motions under 
Rule 60(b) are addressed to the sound discretion of the district court and are generally granted 
only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.”). “Relief under Rule 60(b) is generally not 
favored and is properly granted only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.”  Ins. Co. of 
N. Am. v. Pub. Serv. Mut. Ins. Co., 609 F.3d 122, 131 (2d Cir. 2010) (quotation marks omitted).  
Thus, “[t]he movant must adduce ‘highly convincing material’ in support of the motion.”  Leeber 
Realty LLC v. Trustco Bank, No. 17-CV-2934, 2019 WL 498253, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2019) 

(quoting United States v. Cirami, 563 F.2d 26, 33 (2d Cir. 1977)), aff’d, 798 F. App’x 682 (2d 
Cir. 2019).  This is, in short, a “demanding standard.”  Bell v. Deutsche Bank, No. 18-CV-1593, 
2021 WL 4480549, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2021).                         
    Plaintiff argues that the Court “mishandled facts” and “misevaluated” his arguments.  
(Pl.’s Mem. 1.)  In support of this idea, Plaintiff not only reprises and reforms his arguments, 
(see generally id.), but he also brings forward “35 additional documents,” (id. at 1).  Defendants 
assert that Plaintiff’s arguments “largely rehash the same arguments he presented” and that the 
Motion “must be denied because [Plaintiff] does not show an intervening change of controlling 
law, that new evidence has become available, or that there is a need to correct a clear error or 
prevent manifest injustice.”  (Defs.’ Mem. 1.)  Plaintiff, in reply, makes these same arguments 
and asserts new ones regarding Defendants’ apparent concessions as well as brand new 
arguments for the underlying motion to dismiss.  (See generally Pl.’s Reply Mem.) 
    In the first instance, the Court cannot consider any of Plaintiff’s new exhibits.  “Courts 

typically do not consider new evidence raised on reconsideration.”  Piña v. United States, 
No. 20-CV-1371, 2022 WL 782996, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2022) (citing Munn, 2021 WL 
2355308, at *3).  Put simply, “[a] motion to reconsider is not [a party’s] opportunity to put 
forward evidence that he could have, but failed, to provide the Court when the Court initially 
considered the motion.”  Francis v. AccuBanc Mortg. Corp., No. 19-CV-902, 2021 WL 827123, 
at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 4, 2021) (first alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Posada, 206 
F. Supp. 3d 866, 868 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)).  Plaintiff does not allege that any of these new exhibits 
was previously unavailable or unobtainable, so the Court will not consider them here.  
    With regard to the substance of Plaintiff’s arguments, Plaintiff falls well short of the 
aforementioned high bar.  Because Plaintiff filed the instant Motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), his 

Memorandum in Support of the Motion did not articulate the subsection of Rule 60(b) under 
which he would be entitled to relief.  Nonetheless, the Court addresses the two possible prongs of 
Rule 60(b) into which the Motion could be classified.4                    
              a.  Rule 60(b)(1)                                          
    Under Rule 60(b)(1), the Court may vacate an Order on the basis of “mistake, 
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).  In light of Plaintiff’s 


    4 Plaintiff does not assert in his Motion that there is new evidence in the case, foreclosing 
subsection 2.  (See generally Pl.’s Mem.)  Similarly, Plaintiff does not suggest that Defendants 
engaged in fraud to mislead the Court, foreclosing subsection 3.  (See generally id.)  Subsections 
4 and 5 are also not viable, as Plaintiff does not suggest the judgment is void or that it has been 
satisfied or is no longer viable.  (See generally id.)                    
arguments, including his recitation of seven “Supporting Facts,” (see generally Pl.’s Mem.), and 
his highlighting of purportedly wrong assumptions, Defendants’ ostensible concessions, and his 
new arguments underlying the cause of action itself, (see generally Pl.’s Reply Mem.), the Court 
interprets Plaintiff’s motion as arising under a mistake rather than “inadvertence, surprise, or 

excusable neglect.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1).                            
    “Rule 60(b)(1) motions premised upon mistake are intended to provide relief to a party in 
only two instances: (1) when the party has made an excusable litigation mistake . . . or (2) when 
the judge has made a substantive mistake of law or fact in the final judgment or order.”  Leeber 
Realty, 2019 WL 498253, at *4 (alteration in original) (quoting Bey v. Iaquinto, No. 12-CV-
5875, 2016 WL 462412, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2016)).  Plaintiff does not allege his own 
mistake, only the Court’s, and “[u]nder this provision, a district court may correct its own 
mistakes that are ‘of a substantive legal nature,’ and ‘its own mistake[s] of fact.’”  Castro v. 
Bank of N.Y. Mellon, 825 F. App’x 25, 28 (2d Cir. 2021) (summary order) (alteration in original) 
(quoting Int’l Controls Corp. v. Vesco, 556 F.2d 665, 670 (2d Cir. 1977) and Gey Assocs. Gen. 

P’ship v. 310 Assocs. (In re 310 Assocs.), 346 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 2003)). 
    Plaintiff’s Supporting Facts 1 and 2—that Plaintiff ultimately signed a HIPAA release 
form and that the Court’s description of the Ramapo Police Department’s investigation was 
misleading—speak to the genesis of the Ramapo Police Department’s investigation concerning 
Plaintiff’s sick days.  (See Pl.’s Mem. 3–6.)  Plaintiff argues that the Court “misframed” the facts 
at issue.  (Id. at 5.)  Even if the Court “misframed” the facts at issue—and Plaintiff provides no 
objective basis to substantiate its belief that the Court committed such an error, only semantical 
arguments—adopting an alternate “framing” of the facts alleged, at most, creates frustration with 
the Court’s interpretation thereof, not factual or legal error.  “Dissatisfaction with a judgment 
does not sufficiently justify an allegation of mistake under Rule 60(b)(1).”  Hamilton v. Lee, 188 
F. Supp. 3d 221, 238 (E.D.N.Y. 2016).  Thus, neither Supporting Fact 1 nor Supporting Fact 2 
can support Plaintiff’s Motion.                                           
    The Court agrees with Defendants’ reading of Supporting Facts 3, 4, and 6, each of which 

concern the Court’s recitation of past events, (Pl.’s Mem. 7–12), as Plaintiff seemingly 
“misunderst[oo]d that the Court actually considered the more recent events on their merits,” 
(Defs.’ Mem. 9).  In each of these Supporting Facts, Plaintiff purports to argue that the Court’s 
recitation of older facts skews its analysis and interpretation of the more recent events that 
culminated in Plaintiff’s firing.  (See Pl.’s Mem 7 (describing Supporting Fact 3); 8–9 
(describing Supporting Fact 4); 10–12 (describing Supporting Fact 6).)  But in its 2022 Opinion, 
the Court considered the more recent actions relating specifically to Plaintiff’s firing at length.  
(See 2022 Op. 21–26.)  The Court’s consideration of events preceding Plaintiff’s firing was, as 
the Court stated, solely for additional context and in no way took away from the Court’s 
consideration of the immediate events giving rise to Plaintiff’s firing.  “Rule 60(b)(1) will not 

provide a movant an additional opportunity to make arguments or attempt to win a point already 
‘carefully analyzed and justifiably disposed.’”  Bousa Inc. v. United States (In re Bulk Oil (USA) 
Inc.), Nos. 89-B-13380, 93-CV-4492, 93-CV-4494, 2007 WL 1121739, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 
11, 2007) (quoting Matura v. United States, 189 F.R.D. 86, 90 (S.D.N.Y.1999)).  Accordingly, 
these Facts similarly cannot support Plaintiff’s Motion.                  
    In his explanation for Supporting Fact 3, Plaintiff also accuses the Court of failing to 
countenance Plaintiff’s allegations in his Complaint regarding discussions of seemingly similarly 
situated colleagues.  (See Pl.’s Mem. 7 (arguing that the Court inappropriately held that Plaintiff 
conceded Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff failed to establish an inference of discrimination 
vis-à-vis comparators “despite the verifiable fact that Plaintiff literally did”).)  At the motion to 
dismiss stage, Defendants pointed out that Plaintiff stated only that he shared the same doctor as 
“most”—not all—of a group of officers, that he failed to identify these other officers’ underlying 
medical issues, that they were subject to similar decisionmakers, or that the officers had similar 

responsibilities, histories, or any several other material factors.  (Defs.’ Mem. of Law in Supp. of 
Mot. to Dismiss 15–17 (Dkt. No. 101).)  Moreover, Plaintiff stated in his Complaint that his 
doctor’s note was “identical” to those submitted by other officers, despite the fact that the 
majority of his Doctor’s note is biographical information, and the remainder is specific treatment 
information, neither of which could have or would have been “identical” for any other officer.  
(See Fourth AC ¶ 35.)                                                     
    As the Court remarked in its Opinion, Plaintiff failed to grapple with the specific points 
Defendants made, issuing only a naked, generalized response that he was, contrary to 
Defendants’ assertion, “similarly situated” to these officers.   (Pl.’s Mem. of Law in Opp. of Mot. 
to Dismiss § 7 (Dkt. No. 102).)5  This does not actually address the substance of Defendants’ 

arguments, thereby conceding it.  See DMAC LLC v. City of Peekskill, No. 09-CV-5093, 2012 
WL 4459290, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2012) (holding that “[b]ecause [the nonmovant] ignores 
[the movants’] detailed, specific argument on the issue, it effectively concedes [it]”).   
    Plaintiff aims to rehash the merits of this argument in his Reply, including citing one out-
of-circuit case.  (See Pl.’s Reply Mem. 8–9.)  In the first instance, district courts are “bound by 

    5 Moreover, as Defendants point out, Plaintiff’s concession in his Complaint that he has 
submitted “many doctor’s notes” from “the same doctor” further undermines an inference of 
discrimination, meaning that even if arguendo the Court improperly misread Plaintiff’s failure to 
specifically combat Defendants’ arguments, this is not a “material mistake that changed the 
outcome of the [C]ourt’s judgment.”  Samuels v. United States, No. 12-CV-7362, 2017 WL 
6624849, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 11, 2017) (alteration in original) (quoting Matura, 189 F.R.D. at 
89 ).                                                                     
the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and those of the Circuit Court of 
Appeals in their own circuit, but are not bound by those of a federal court of co-ordinate 
jurisdiction, or even the decisions of a federal Circuit Court of Appeals in another circuit.”  
Cont’l Sec. Co. v. Interborough Rapid Transit Co., 165 F. 945, 959–60 (S.D.N.Y. 1908); see also 

Langsam v. Vallarta Gardens, No. 08-CV-2222, 2009 WL 2252612, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 
2009) (noting that the District Court for the Southern District of New York is bound only by 
“[c]ontrolling decisions,” which “include decisions from the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit; they do not include decisions from other circuits or district courts, even 
courts in the Southern District of New York”).  “The Court must therefore adhere to and follow 
precedent set by the Second Circuit, while jurisprudence from elsewhere—such as the case to 
which Plaintiff[] direct[s] the Court—may only be considered for its persuasive value when the 
Second Circuit has not issued such precedent.”  Barton v. Ne. Transp., Inc., No. 21-CV-326, 
2022 WL 203593, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2022).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s citation to one out-
of-circuit case is unavailing at best.                                    

    More importantly, as the Court has already explained, Plaintiff’s argument falls short on 
the merits.  Plaintiff’s allegations that several white officers have used sick notes without 
incident and that some unspecified portion thereof have the same doctor does not satisfy the 
Second Circuit’s standard that an inference of discrimination is born of allegations that one is 
“similarly situation in all material respects to the individuals with whom []he seeks to compare 
[him]self.”  Brown v. Daikin Am. Inc., 756 F.3d 219, 230 (2d Cir. 2014) (quotation marks 
omitted) (emphasis added).  That Plaintiff offered a name to this group of people—the “Preferred 
Group”—and referenced that name throughout his FAC does not change that.  (See Pl.’s Reply 
Mem. 8–9.)                                                                
    The Court also agrees with Defendants’ interpretation of Plaintiff’s Supporting Fact 5 as 
misinterpreting the Court’s 2020 Opinion, which permitted Plaintiff the opportunity to file a 
Fourth Amended Complaint.  (See Sep. 2020 Op. & Order (“2020 Op.”) 42 (Dkt. No. 79).)  But 
“‘[t]he mere filing of an [a]mended [c]omplaint does not entitle [a] [p]laintiff to relitigate his 

claims absent new factual allegations.’”  Kotler v. Boley, No. 17-CV-239, 2020 WL 905752, at 
*3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2020) (quoting Weslowksi v. Zugibe, 96 F. Supp. 3d 308, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 
2015)), reconsideration denied, 2020 WL 8665289 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2020).  “Because the 
[Fourth] Amended Complaint . . . is in large part identical to Plaintiff[’s] [Third Amended] 
Complaint, the law of the case doctrine counsels against reconsideration of the 
Court’s . . . dismissal of the [Third Amended] Complaint.”  Weslowksi, 96 F. Supp. 3d at 316; 
see also Kotler, 2020 WL 905752, at *3 (collecting cases applying the law-of-the-case doctrine 
to dismiss portions of a pro se complaint where the two pleadings at issue were “substantially 
identical”).  Accordingly, that the Court applied the law of the case doctrine to dismiss identical 
claims is neither an error of law nor fact.                               

    Finally, Plaintiff’s argument regarding Support Fact 7 provides no refuge.  The Rockland 
County Police Act was referenced only once in Plaintiff’s Fourth Amended Complaint, wherein 
Plaintiff “allege[d] that in addition to being false, Defendant[s’] alleged violation is time barred 
per the Rockland County Police Act.”  (Fourth AC ¶ 48.)6  This concern, as Defendants note, “is 
not at issue” in this Action and would have been appropriately raised “in the disciplinary hearing 


    6 Additionally, Plaintiff asserts that “the Rockland County Police Act . . . is actual New 
York State Law.”  (Pl.’s Mem. 13.)  The Court cannot find evidence of New York State law 
under that title; rather, the law governs only Rockland County, “authoriz[ing] town boards 
[therein] to hear and determine disciplinary charges against members of the police department in 
accordance with its own rules and regulations.”  City of Schenectady v. New York State Pub. 
Emp. Rels. Bd., 86 N.E.3d 536, 540 n.2 (N.Y. 2017).                       
itself, and on the appeal to the Appellate Division.”  (Defs.’ Mem. 13.)  This Fact is therefore 
irrelevant here.                                                          
    This remains true as Plaintiff rehashes such arguments in his Reply.  Plaintiff asserts that 
“the hearing officer did not factor in that Plaintiff did sign a HIPAA release in his evaluation of 

the case before rendering a decision.”  (Pl.’s Reply Mem. 12.)  Plaintiff also asserts that 
Defendants’ actions “subverted their own written policy” and constituted a “violation[] of the 
Ramapo PBA’s active labor contract.”  (Id. at 14.)  The Court cannot stress enough that Plaintiff 
did not bring such claims in his Fourth Amended Complaint; these arguments are thus not 
properly before the Court and the Court will not opine on their veracity, save to say they are 
immaterial to this proceeding.                                            
    The remaining arguments in Plaintiff’s Reply similarly fail to persuade the Court that it 
made a mistake of fact or law.  First, Plaintiff argues that Defendants apparently concede 
important points that demonstrate Plaintiff met his burden.  Plaintiff begins by asserting that the 
Defendants made “two key assumptions” that led them to discriminate against Plaintiff, pointing 
to Flowers v. Mississippi, 139 S. Ct. 2228 (2019).  (See Pl.’s Reply Mem. 3–4.)7  In the first 

instance, Flowers concerns a Batson violation, which speaks to the striking of jurors on the sole 
basis of race in violation of a criminal defendant’s Fourteenth Amendment rights.  See generally 
139 S. Ct. 2228.  Flowers is wholly irrelevant to this case.              
    Nonetheless, to the extent the Court views Plaintiff’s citation to Flowers as simply a 
rhetorical device by which to rehash his arguments concerning Defendants’ actions (in the form 
of two “assumptions”), Plaintiff’s arguments regarding Defendants’ supposed concessions are 


    7 When citing to Plaintiff’s Reply, the Court refers to the ECF-stamped page numbers at 
the top right-hand corner of each page.                                   
erroneous.  Plaintiff avers that Defendants “concede[] . . . that Plaintiff satisfied all [of] the legal 
elements of a [p]rima facie case of discrimination under Title VII.”  (Pl.’s Mem. 7.)  This is 
false.  Defendants simply agreed with the Court that the only event that qualifies as an adverse 
event, meaning the only event that could give rise to a Title VII claim, is Plaintiff’s firing; this is 

simply not the same as stating that Plaintiff met his burden in establishing a prima facie claim for 
discrimination.  Defendants say as much two paragraphs after the language Plaintiff cited: 
“Because the Fourth Amended Complaint did not allege Plaintiff was ‘similarly situated in all 
material respects’ to any other officers, the Court properly found that Plaintiff failed to state a 
discrimination claim regarding his termination.”  (Def.’s Mem. 8.)  Accordingly, it is inaccurate 
to say that Defendants conceded this point.                               
    Lastly, Plaintiff makes yet another new argument in his Reply based on the continuing 
violation doctrine; it is both misguided and unavailing.  At the outset, “‘[a]rguments made for the 
first time in a reply brief need not be considered by a court,’ of course.”  Kowalski v. 
YellowPages.com, LLC, No. 10-CV-7318, 2012 WL 1097350, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2012) 

(quoting Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Dumas, 960 F. Supp. 710, 720 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 1997)).  
Nevertheless, even if the Court were to consider it, Plaintiff would still fall short.   
    The Court’s previous discounting of intermittent, non-continuous events speaks to 
whether events that occurred years ago—i.e., events for which the statute of limitations has 
run—can nonetheless give rise to a discrimination claim.  See Corrado v. N.Y. Unified Ct. Sys., 
163 F. Supp. 3d 1, 20 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (“The continuing violation doctrine provides that, ‘if a 
plaintiff has experienced a continuous practice and policy of discrimination, . . . the 
commencement of the statute of limitations period may be delayed until the last discriminatory 
act in furtherance of it.’” (alteration in original) (quoting Washington v. County of Rockland, 373 
F.3d 310, 317 (2d Cir. 2004))), aff’d 698 F. App’x 36 (2d Cir. 2017).  In other words, the 
doctrine has no bearing on the connection between the investigation and the firing. 
    More importantly, though, all participants in this Action have been all fours insofar as 
Defendants’ investigation and firing are related.  The question was whether, in addition to 

Plaintiff’s firing, the investigation itself that preceded—and precipitated—Plaintiff’s firing was 
also a discrete action that could give rise to an inference of discrimination separate and apart 
from Plaintiff’s firing.  The Court held that it did not for the reasons stated, (see 2022 Op. 23–
25), and the continuing violation doctrine does not change this.          
    In sum, Plaintiff has not carried the substantial burden of demonstrating that the Court 
has made a “substantive mistake of law or fact in the final judgment or order.”  Leeber Realty, 
2019 WL 498253, at *4 (quotation marks omitted).                          
              b.  Rule 60(b)(6)                                          
    The Second Circuit long ago recognized that “it is settled that [Rules] 60(b)(1) and 
60(b)(6) are not pari passu and are mutually exclusive, and that the latter section cannot be used 
to break out from the rigid time restriction of the former.”  Rinieri v. News Syndicate Co., 385 

F.2d 818, 822 (2d Cir. 1967).  In other words, “any conduct which generally falls under the 
former cannot stand as a ground for relief under the latter.”  United States v. Cirami, 535 F.2d 
736, 740 (2d Cir. 1976).  “It is undeniable that [Plaintiff’s Motion] is, at bottom, premised on 
[the Court’s purported] mistake.”  Stevens v. Miller, 676 F.3d 62, 68 (2d Cir. 2012).  
Nonetheless, given Plaintiff’s status as a pro se litigant and the Court’s concomitant obligation to 
consider his submissions to raise the strongest possible arguments, see Triestman v. Fed. Bureau 
of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 2006), the Court evaluates his motion under Rule 
60(b)(6).                                                                 
    “Rule 60(b)(6) authorizes a district court to grant relief to a moving party for ‘any other 
reason that justifies relief.’  It is a ‘grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular 
case.’  But that reservoir is not bottomless.  Recognizing Rule 60(b)(6)’s potentially sweeping 
reach, courts require the party seeking to avail itself of the Rule to demonstrate that 

‘extraordinary circumstances’ warrant relief.”  Stevens, 676 F.3d at 67 (citation omitted) (quoting 
Matarese v. LeFevre, 801 F.2d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 1986)).  Indeed, the Second Circuit has 
“described Rule 60(b)(6) as a catch-all provision that ‘is properly invoked only when there are 
extraordinary circumstances justifying relief [and] when the judgment may work an extreme and 
undue hardship[.]’”  Metzler Inv. GmbH v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 970 F.3d 133, 143 (2d 
Cir. 2020) (emphasis added) (quoting Nemaizer, 793 F.2d at 63).           
    “Given that the ‘Rule does not particularize the factors that justify relief,’ courts have 
refrained from applying a rigid test when deciding Rule 60(b)(6) motions.”  Stanley v. CUNY, 
John Jay Coll., No. 18-CV-4844, 2020 WL 6823011, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2020) (quoting 
Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863–64 (1988)); cf. Mirlis v. Greer, 

No. 16-CV-678, 2022 WL 959915, at *3 (D. Conn. Mar. 30, 2022) (“Relief under Rule 60(b)(6) 
is less well-defined.”).  Lacking discrete tests, the Court relies on high-water—or low-water—
marks to guide its thinking.                                              
    For example, a sister court in this district has held that extraordinary circumstances were 
not found where an incarcerated, legally blind, pro se plaintiff was denied meaningful access to 
the prison law library and to legal assistance from the facility itself.  See Brown v. Nelson, 
No. 05-CV-4498, 2008 WL 4104040, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2008).  Another court in this 
district denied a motion under Rule 60(b)(6), holding that no extraordinary circumstances existed 
to justify reopening a default judgment when the movant’s failure to appear was due to his 
illness.  See generally New Card, Inc. v. Glenns, No. 00-CV-4756, 2004 WL 540417 (S.D.N.Y. 
Mar. 18, 2004), aff’d, 137 F. App’x 384 (2d Cir. 2005).  In contrast to illness, handicap, or 
obvious obstructions to pressing his case, “Plaintiff has not shown any ‘extraordinary 
circumstances’ entitling him to relief under Rule 60(b)(6).”  Kamdem-Ouaffo v. Balchem Corp., 

No. 17-CV-2810, 2022 WL 1000285, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2022) (citing Gonzalez v. Crosby, 
545 U.S. 524, 536 (2005)).                                                
                          III.  Conclusion                               
    For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion is denied.  Because the underlying dismissal 
is the first adjudication of Plaintiff’s claims of a hostile work environment on the merits, the 
dismissal of hostile work environment claims is without prejudice.  Plaintiff is advised that the 
fifth amended complaint, should Plaintiff file one, will replace, not supplement, all prior 
complaints.  Accordingly, the fifth amended complaint must contain all of the claims, factual 
allegations, and exhibits that Plaintiff wishes the Court to consider.  Plaintiff is also advised that 
he may not bring any claims that have already been dismissed with prejudice, including his 

claims against the Individual Defendants, (2020 Op. 42), all claims against the Ramapo Police 
Demartment, (id.), any claims for punitive damages against the Town of Ramapo or individual 
Defendants in their official capacities, (id.), as well as a discriminatory workplace or retaliation 
under Title VII and § 1983, (2022 Op. 25–26, 33).   Furthermore, if Plaintiff fails to abide by the 
30-day deadline, the Action will be dismissed with prejudice.             
    The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the pending Motions, (Dkt. 
Nos. 110–112), and mail a copy of this Opinion & Order to Plaintiff.      

SO ORDERED.

KENNETH M. KARAS, United States District Judge:                           

    Plaintiff Ernst Theodore Tenemille (“Plaintiff”) brings this Action against former Town 
of Ramapo Supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence (“St. Lawrence”), former Councilman Patrick 
Withers (“Withers”), Chief of Police Bradley R. Weidel (“Weidel”), Chief of Staff Thomas 
Cokeley (“Cokeley”), Squad Lieutenant Daniel Hyman (“Hyman”), Squad Sergeant Salomon 
Matos (“Matos”), Desk Sergeant Christopher Franklin (“Franklin”; collectively, “Individual 
Defendants”), and the Town of Ramapo (the “Town” or “Ramapo”; collectively “Defendants”), 
alleging that Defendants discriminated against and subsequently retaliated against him on the 
basis of his race, color, national origin, and religion, in violation of Section 1983 of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“§ 1983”), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
(“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.; and New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”), 
N.Y. Exec. Law § 290, et seq.  (See generally Fourth Am. Compl. (“Fourth AC”) (Dkt. No. 88).)  
Before the Court is a Motion To Dismiss (the “Motion”), pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 12(b)(6), filed by the Town, Weidel, Cokeley, Hyman, Matos, and Franklin (the 
“Moving Defendants”).1  (Not. of Mot. (Dkt. No. 99).)2                    

    For the reasons discussed below, the Motion is granted.              
                          I.  Background                                 
    A.  Factual Background                                               
    The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff’s Fourth AC and are assumed to be true for 
the purpose of resolving the instant Motion.                              
         1.  Context Regarding Plaintiff’s Experiences in the Ramapo Police Department 
    Plaintiff is a Haitian American who immigrated to the United States from Haiti in 1984.  
(Fourth AC ¶ 26.)  After graduating from high school in 1988, Plaintiff joined the U.S. Navy, 
from which he was honorably discharged in 1991.  (Id. ¶¶ 27–28.)  Plaintiff then graduated from 
State University of New York (“SUNY”) Rockland Community College in 1999 with an 
Associate’s degree in criminal justice and from SUNY Purchase in May 2017 with a Bachelor’s 

degree in liberal studies and a minor in psychology.  (Id. ¶¶ 29, 32.)  In 2000, Plaintiff joined the 
Rockland Sheriff’s Department as a correction officer.  (Id. ¶ 30.)  In 2002, he was hired by the 
Town of Ramapo Police Department (the “Department”) as a police officer.  (Id. ¶ 31.)  The 


    1 Plaintiff names Cokeley in the case caption but omits him when listing the defendants in 
the Complaint’s preliminary statement.                                    
    2 Defendants St. Lawrence and Withers have not appeared in this Action, and, according 
to Moving Defendants, “[u]pon information and belief,” they were never served.  (Mov. Defs.’ 
Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. (“Mov. Defs.’ Mem.”) 22 n.11 (Dkt. No. 101).)  Plaintiff filed 
affidavits of service indicating that these Defendants were served at Ramapo’s Town Hall, (Dkt. 
Nos. 6, 7, 11, 16), but Moving Defendants represent that these Defendants were not associated 
with or employed by the Town when service occurred, (Mov. Defs.’ Mem. 22 n.11). 
following discrete events, which all occurred once he was an employee of the Department, 
provide context to Plaintiff’s claims.                                    
              a.  Background Check                                       
    In the same year Plaintiff was hired by the Department, he attended the Rockland County 
Police Academy.  (Id. ¶ 95.)  While there, he was “abruptly pulled out of his training” and asked 

questions about alleged “‘inaccuracies’ and concerns about his ‘character and background.’”  
(Id.)  According to Plaintiff, the detectives who conducted his background check for the 
Department could not confirm his service with the Navy and claimed that the copy of the “U.S. 
Navy service discharge form (DD-214)” provided by Plaintiff was fraudulent.  (Id.)  Weidel, 
who was serving as an Administrative Sergeant at the time, led this investigation, and questioned 
whether Plaintiff had instead served in the Republic of Haiti’s Navy rather than the United States 
Navy as well as whether Plaintiff had falsified other information on his application, including his 
age.  (Id.)  Plaintiff was “in fear of losing his employment” due to this incident.  (Id.)  Despite 
this incident, the information on Plaintiff’s application was later confirmed.  (Id.)  
              b.  Yelling Incident                                       

    In December 2004, Plaintiff heard Sergeant Brian Corbett (“Corbett”), a fellow officer, 
“rag[e] loudly” against him, during which Corbett “yelled [that Plaintiff] ‘does not belong’” in 
the Department, and that “‘[h]e should go back to corrections if they would have him[.]’”  (Id. ¶ 
99.)3  According to Plaintiff, Corbett then stated that “[African Americans are] only [two-fifths] 
of a person anyway.”  (Id. (quotation marks omitted).)  Plaintiff “immediately notified a 



    3 Plaintiff does not provide Corbett’s first name in the Fourth AC.  (See generally Fourth 
AC.)  However, Corbett is identified in prior pleadings.  (See generally Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) 
(naming Sergeant Brian Corbett as a defendant).)                          
supervisor,” but Corbett “never apologized” for his statements “nor was he ever disciplined in 
any way for making them.”  (Id.)                                          
              c.  Report Writing                                         
    Around this time, Plaintiff was “continually advised that he needed to improve his report 
writing skills,” and was told that he had “illegible handwriting.”  (Id. ¶ 97 (quotation marks 

omitted).)  Corbett was Plaintiff’s immediate supervisor at the time.  (Id.)  Plaintiff turned in a 
report on a domestic violence incident to Corbett that contained several errors that had been 
covered with white-out, and Plaintiff asked Corbett if he could re-copy the report.  (Id.)  Corbett 
replied that the report was fine, and ultimately reviewed and approved it.  (Id.)  However, the 
same report was later flagged as “‘messy and unprofessional’ further up the chain of command,” 
as Corbett then wrote up Plaintiff for “turning in a messy report” despite his earlier approval.  
(Id.)  In response, Plaintiff was required to retake a “video-taped[] course on report writing,” 
which he had already taken and passed at the Rockland County Police Academy.  (Id.)  Plaintiff 
alleges that Corbett pushed the report “up the chain of command” specifically to tarnish Plaintiff 
and give rise to a “green sheet (supervisory contact report),” which would be brought to the 

attention of Plaintiff’s supervisor and further harm Plaintiff’s reputation.  (Id.)   
    Due to the complaints he received about his handwriting, Plaintiff began typing his 
reports.  (Id. ¶ 98.)  Soon after the incident with the report given to Corbett, Squad Lieutenant 
David Holmes (“Holmes”) summoned Plaintiff to speak to him and Sergeant Patrick Reynar 
(“Reynar”).  (Id.)  Reynar “expressed surprise” at the improved quality of Plaintiff’s reports.  
(Id.)  During this meeting, Holmes speculated that “‘perhaps Plaintiff was having [his] wife 
complete the reports for [him].’”  (Id. (alteration in original).)  Plaintiff’s annual evaluation did 
not include mention of his improved reports.  (Id.)                       
              d.  Prison Cell Incident                                   
    In August 2005, Plaintiff supervised a prisoner in a holding cell at the police station.  (Id. 
¶ 100.)  When the prisoner asked to make a phone call, Plaintiff handed the prisoner the receiver 
and dialed the number while remaining outside of the holding cell, per Department regulations.  
(Id.)  Plaintiff’s supervisor, Lieutenant Leslie Lampert (“Lampert”), who is white, submitted a 
report into Plaintiff’s personnel record stating Plaintiff had in fact gone into the cell.  (Id.)4  

Lampert then refused to review camera footage at Plaintiff’s behest, which Plaintiff asserts 
would have exonerated him.  (Id.)                                         
              e.  Being Demeaned by a Fellow Officer                     
    In June 2006, Franklin, a white male officer, “demeaned” Plaintiff in front of other 
officers for issuing a traffic ticket to one of Franklin’s friends.  (Id. ¶ 101.)  Although Plaintiff 
complained about this encounter, Franklin was not reprimanded; Franklin was instead promoted 
shortly after and has continued to thrive in the Department.  (Id.)5      
              f.  Sector Two                                             
    The following year, Plaintiff was assigned to cover Sector Two, an area of Ramapo large 
enough that patrolling it created a “workload [that] was too heavy for one officer to effectively 

handle.”  (Id. ¶ 104.)  Plaintiff submits that he raised this to his supervisors but was ignored; he 
was instead “relentlessly reprimanded for not being fast enough.”  (Id.)  When Plaintiff was later 
transferred to a different section of the Town, a white police officer took over Sector Two.  (Id.).  


    4 Lampert’s first name is not provided in the Fourth AC or any accompanying materials.  
However, Lampert is identified in prior pleadings.  (See Compl. (Dkt. No. 1) ¶ 39 (identifying 
Lieutenant Leslie Lampert).)                                              

    5 Franklin is alleged to be a sergeant rather than a lieutenant elsewhere in the Fourth AC.  
(Compare id. ¶ 15 (providing the title of “Sergeant” and “Desk Sergeant” to Franklin) with id. ¶ 
101 (observing that Franklin was promoted to lieutenant); id. ¶ 109 (same).) 
That white officer then raised the same complaints Plaintiff had.  (Id.)  Following the white 
officer’s complaint, the Department subsequently deemed the sector to be too large of a 
workload for one officer and split it into two sectors, assigning a second officer to oversee what 
was once Sector Two.  (Id.)  Plaintiff raised “his concern over the difference in treatment and the 
handling these two identical complaints,” but his overtures were ignored.  (Id.)6   

              g.  Shoveling Incident                                     
    Also in 2007, Plaintiff states that he and his wife had just endured a miscarriage.  (Id. ¶ 
102.)  Plaintiff took a legitimate day of sick leave when feeling ill.  (Id.)  Despite having taken 
the day off due to his illness, Plaintiff shoveled his driveway because his wife was medically 
unable to do so following the miscarriage.  (Id.)  An officer witnessed him shoveling.  (Id.)  That 
officer then reported to others in the Department, who came to conclude that “Plaintiff had 
misled the [D]epartment regarding his reported sick day.”  (Id.)  Plaintiff was not offered the 
opportunity to explain himself or get the report expunged.  (Id.)         
              h.  Scheduling Request                                     
    In or around June 2008, the Department accommodated a newly hired Jewish officer’s 

request for a modified schedule pursuant to a religious accommodation request without question 
or pushback.  (Id. ¶ 105.)  Plaintiff subsequently requested a modified schedule to accommodate 
his religious beliefs as a Seventh Day Adventist.  (Id.)  Months after filing the request, it was 
only partially honored: Plaintiff would only be allowed to take off days for the Sabbath if he had 
already scheduled it and if he had personally identified an officer willing to work the scheduled 
shift.  (Id.)                                                             


    6 Plaintiff alleges that the letters of reprimand he received for his allegedly substandard 
patrolling of Sector Two were unearthed and then later used against him to “justify” his 
termination, (id.), but he does not articulate how these letters were used.  
    In fall of 2009, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (“EEOC”) regarding the religious observance disparities.  (Id. ¶ 106).  Following 
his complaint, the EEOC issued a right to sue letter.  (Id.)  Simultaneously, the instances of 
discriminatory conduct temporarily dissipated for fear of suit.  (Id.)  Notwithstanding the letter’s 

issuance, Plaintiff forewent filing suit in order to avoid causing further discord within the 
Department.  (Id.)                                                        
              i.  Euthanization Incident                                 
    In June 2010, Plaintiff was again written up in a report alleging that he “us[ed] too many 
rounds . . . to euthanize an injured animal.”  (Id. ¶ 107.)  According to Plaintiff, the Department 
does not have a policy as to how many rounds constitute “too many.”  (Id.)  Nonetheless, as a 
result of this incident, Plaintiff was forced to undertake “remedial firearms training[,] []which he 
passed with excellence[.]”  (Id.)                                         
              j.  Traffic Ticket Deletion                                
    In December 2012, Plaintiff noticed that traffic tickets he had issued were deleted from 
the records of the Town and Department, and none of Plaintiff’s supervisors knew what had 

happened to them.  (Id. ¶ 108.)  Plaintiff lodged a written complaint, for which he was “severely 
reprimanded, sanctioned[,] and . . . was subjected to a psychological evaluation and test.”  (Id.; 
Fourth AC Ex. 14.)  It was later discovered that Franklin was responsible for deleting the tickets.  
(Fourth AC ¶ 109.)  Franklin was “minimally reprimanded” for having done so and was not 
required to undergo a “psychological test.”  (Id. ¶ 109.)  Moreover, despite his misconduct, 
Plaintiff alleges that the Department recently promoted Franklin.  (Id.)  
              k.  Political Solicitation                                 
    In September 2013, the “then [Police Benevolent Association] president (and now)[] 
Detective Dennis Procter” used the Department’s email system to solicit the personal e-mail 
addresses of officers “for the political benefit of Councilman . . . Withers,” who was 
campaigning for re-election as councilman.  (Id. ¶ 110.)  Plaintiff was the only officer solicited 
who declined to provide his email address, which “generated a wave of discriminatory and 
retaliatory backlash” until Plaintiff was later terminated in 2016.  (Id.)  Plaintiff alleges that 

Withers “played a decisive role” in this reaction.  (Id.)                 
              l.  Insufficient Evaluation                                
    During Plaintiff’s annual evaluation in 2014, which was delivered by Hyman, it was not 
mentioned that Plaintiff had stopped an attempted suicide.  (Id. ¶ 111.)  This was remedied and 
the action was noted in his evaluation, but only after Plaintiff protested.  (Id.)  The evaluation 
also noted that Plaintiff had had the fourth most arrests by any officer in the Department in 2014, 
despite being injured and unable to work for a month, and that he was recommended for a 
“Lifesaving Award.”  (Id.)  Further, “commendation letters” Plaintiff received as a result of his 
actions were omitted from his evaluation.  (Id.)  Despite these plaudits, Plaintiff received a rating 
of “Average” for the year.  (Id.)  Moreover, he never received the “Lifesaving Award.”  (Id.)  
Instead, his 2014 evaluation noted that Plaintiff was written up when he responded, “Great idea,” 

to an e-mail sent by Weidel because Plaintiff “should have known that no response was 
necessary.”  (Id.) (quotation marks omitted).                             
         2.  The Events Giving Rise to Plaintiff’s Termination           
    From November 2 through November 5, 2015, Plaintiff took sick days.  (Fourth AC 
Ex. 16, at 1, 5.)  Pursuant to the Department’s policy, any officer taking more than three 
consecutive sick days “shall, no later than the fourth day of sick absence, provide to the 
Department a physician’s or dentist’s note reflecting the date(s) of visitation at the 
physician/dentist office, the illness or injury for which treatment was administered, a prognosis, a 
diagnosis, and the anticipated period of illness.”  (Fourth AC Ex. 5, at § C.2.f.)  Additionally, the 
policy makes plain that “[n]on-compliance with this provision may result in loss of pay for the 
period of absence and disciplinary charges.”  (Id.)                       
    Plaintiff submitted two notes from Dr. Stephen Klein dated November 5, 2015 and a third 
note dated November 9, 2015.  (See Fourth AC Ex. 11, 15.)7  The first note reads, in pertinent 

part, “Ernest Tenemille (11/15/1970) is currently under my medical care and was seen in the 
office on 11/03/2015.  Please excuse his absence from work on 11/4/2015 and 11/5/2015.”  
(Fourth AC Ex. 15, at 1.)  The second note repeats these sentences in full, and then reads: “This 
patient was seen for musculoskeletal pain to the left distal arm which [sic] he was advised to 
wear a brace for 2 weeks.  This patient can return to work at earliest convenience with no 
limitations.”  (Id. at 2.)  The final note reads: “Ernest Tenemille (11/15/1970) is currently under 
my medical care and may return to [sic] on 11/08/2015.  Was also seen on 11/3/2015. Dx 
[diagnosis]: left forearm/wrist pain. Activity is restricted as follows: none[.]”  (Id. at 3.)   
    According to Hyman’s testimony, the Department initiated an investigation upon the 
suspicion that Plaintiff was abusing his sick leave days, in part because the doctor’s notes 

purportedly omitted details necessary to comply with the Department’s policy.  (See generally 
Fourth AC Ex. 3; see also Fourth AC ¶ 42.)  On November 23, 2015, Plaintiff was ordered to 
sign a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) release pursuant to the 
Department’s investigation, which narrowly sought medical records relating to Plaintiff’s injury 
and corresponding sick days.  (Fourth AC ¶¶ 42, 51.)  Plaintiff demurred and ultimately declined 
to sign the release.  (Id. ¶ 51.)  Plaintiff wrote to a superior officer detailing his reasoning for 


    7 It is not clear to the Court when the doctor’s notes were submitted.  Email records 
suggest the notes were submitted on November 5 and 9, respectively, though that is not certain.  
(See Fourth AC Ex. 11, at 1–2.)  The date of submission is not of paramount importance, as 
neither Party relies upon it in any material way.                         
declining to sign the release and signaling an openness to do so upon “proof” that the 
Department was entitled to the information sought.  (Id.)                 
    At 11:40 p.m. on November 30, 2015, Plaintiff received a second order to sign, approve, 
notarize, and return a HIPAA release form regarding “medical records in connection with the 

investigation of your absence from duty on November 2,3,4,5 [sic].”  (Fourth AC Ex. 16, at 1.)  
Moreover, the release was to be returned within 24 hours.  (Id.; Fourth AC ¶ 64.)  In response, 
Plaintiff did not refuse to follow the order but instead questioned Department’s authority to 
require such an action.  (Fourth AC ¶ 64.)  Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s inquiry, Matos 
represented to Weidel that Plaintiff refused to sign the order.  (Id. ¶ 54.)  Following this refusal, 
Plaintiff “endure[d] two days of interrogation, without the benefit of effective counsel” regarding 
this episode.  (Id. ¶ 104.)8                                              
    On March 10, 2016, “charges against Plaintiff were drawn” in relation to this episode.  
(Id. ¶ 48.)  The following day, the charges were “issued to Plaintiff.”  (Id.)  “Plaintiff asserts that 
[the issuance of charges] marked the official beginning of the process which ultimately led to 

Plaintiff’s termination.”  (Id. ¶ 20.)  Plaintiff litigated his charges before a hearing officer in the 
months that followed.  (Id. ¶¶ 21, 47).                                   
    Ultimately, Plaintiff was terminated on November 16, 2016.  (Id. ¶ 19.)   
    On or about October 4, 2017, Plaintiff filed a second complaint with the EEOC, alleging 
“unlawful discriminatory employment practices because of race/color, national origin, age, sex, 
and religion.”  (Id. ¶ 22.)  On October 30, 2017, “the EEOC rendered a determination finding to 



    8 Plaintiff does not state in the Fourth AC when this interrogation occurred.  (See 
generally Fourth AC.)  However, in Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”), Plaintiff 
asserted that it took place on December 16 and 17, 2015.  (See TAC ¶¶ 69, 70 (Dkt. No.67).)   
support the allegations of the October 4[,] 2017 [c]omplaint” and issued to Plaintiff a right-to-sue 
letter.  (Id. ¶¶ 22–23.)                                                  
    Beyond the discrete events discussed above, Plaintiff alleges that during the course of his 
employment, he consistently “fe[lt] degraded, unappreciated and not welcomed,” describing his 

experience as “isolating” and likening his status to one of “an escaped convict posing as a police 
officer.”  (Id. ¶ 98.)  He was “continually singled out” by other officers “including his direct 
supervisor[,] [a]ll of whom, collectively or in part, subjected Plaintiff to a constant bombardment 
of discrimination and harassment.”  (Id. ¶ 96.)                           
    B.  Procedural Background                                            
    Plaintiff filed his original Complaint on January 26, 2018, at which point he was 
proceeding pro se.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  On March 19, 2018, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint.  
(Dkt. No. 20.)  On April 3, 2018, Moving Defendants filed a pre-motion letter seeking to file a 
Motion To Dismiss the Amended Complaint, and the Court scheduled a pre-motion conference.  
(Dkt. Nos. 22–23.)  Prior to the conference, Plaintiff filed two applications for pro bono counsel, 

which the Court denied without prejudice.  (Dkt. Nos. 27–29.)  On June 12, 2018, the Court held 
a pre-motion conference and set a briefing schedule for Moving Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss 
the Amended Complaint.  (Dkt. (minute entry for June 12, 2018).)  After receiving leave to file 
excess pages and an extension from the Court, (Dkt. Nos. 31, 36), Moving Defendants filed their 
Motion To Dismiss the Amended Complaint on August 21, 2018, (Dkt. Nos. 33–35), after which 
Plaintiff obtained counsel, (Dkt. Nos. 41–42).  Plaintiff filed a Response to the Motion To 
Dismiss the Amended Complaint on November 2, 2018, (Dkt. No. 46), after receiving an 
extension from the Court, (Dkt. No. 45).  Also after receiving an extension, (Dkt. No. 48), 
Moving Defendants filed their Reply, (Dkt. No. 49).                       
    On March 29, 2019, the Court issued an Order denying Moving Defendants’ Motion To 
Dismiss the Amended Complaint without prejudice, given that Plaintiff asserted in his Response 
that he had challenged his termination in an Article 78 proceeding that was pending in New York 
state court.  (Order 1–2 (Dkt. No. 50).)  As such, the Court directed Plaintiff to clarify which 

claims had been raised in the Article 78 proceeding.  (Id. at 2.)  The Court also noted that some 
of Plaintiff’s claims in the Amended Complaint had already been adjudicated and dismissed in a 
separate action before Judge Seibel on June 25, 2015, except for claims related to Plaintiff’s 
termination.  (Id. at 1.)  Plaintiff filed his supplemental response to this Order on April 12, 2019, 
to which Moving Defendants replied on May 8, 2019.  (Dkt. Nos. 51, 54.)  The Court held 
another pre-motion conference on May 15, 2019, after which Plaintiff filed a Second Amended 
Complaint on June 17, 2019.  (See Dkt. (minute entry for May 15, 2019); Second Am. Compl. 
(Dkt. No. 57).)  On July 1, 2019, Moving Defendants sought to file another Motion To Dismiss, 
(Dkt. No. 58), which Plaintiff opposed, (Dkt. Nos. 60, 62).  The Court scheduled a pre-motion 
conference for August 22, 2019, which was then rescheduled to September 10, 2019.  (Dkt. Nos. 

63, 65.)  At the pre-motion conference, Plaintiff represented that he would file a Third Amended 
Complaint (“TAC”), which he did on October 9, 2019.  (See Dkt. (minute entry for September 
10, 2019); Dkt. No. 67.)                                                  
    On October 23, 2019, Moving Defendants once again sought to file a Motion To Dismiss 
the TAC, and the Court set a briefing schedule on October 30, 2019.  (Dkt. Nos. 68–69.)  After 
receiving an extension from the Court, (Dkt. No. 71), Moving Defendants filed a Motion To 
Dismiss on December 19, 2019.  (Dkt. No. 72.)  After the Court granted his request for an 
extension, Plaintiff filed his Response on February 3, 2020.  (Dkt. No. 77).)  Moving Defendants 
filed a Reply on February 18, 2020.  (Dkt. No. 78).)                      
    On September 24, 2020, the Court granted Moving Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss 
without prejudice, with the exception of Plaintiff’s Title VII claims against the Individual 
Defendants, all claims against the Ramapo Police Department, and any claims for punitive 
damages against the Town or individual Defendants in their official capacities, which were 

dismissed with prejudice.  (Op. & Order (“Op.”) 42 (Dkt. No. 79).)  The Court made clear in its 
opinion that Plaintiff had the right to file a fourth amended complaint within 30 days pursuant to 
its ruling.                                                               
    Plaintiff availed himself of that right, filing the Fourth AC on December 1, 2020.  (Dkt. 
No. 88.)  Per the Fourth AC, Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief as well as 
compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  (Fourth AC 36–37.)   
    On January 17, 2021, Moving Defendants submitted a Letter Motion requesting a pre-
motion conference in anticipation of moving to dismiss the Fourth AC.  (Dkt. No. 93.)  On 
February 1, 2021, the Court set a briefing schedule.  (Dkt. No. 95.)  Moving Defendants filed the 
instant Motion on March 22, 2021.  (Not. of Mot.; Decl. of Vernée Pelage, Esq. in Supp. of Mot. 

(Dkt. No. 100); Mov. Defs.’ Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mov. Defs.’ Mot. To Dismiss (“Mov. 
Defs.’ Mem.”) (Dkt. No. 101).)  Plaintiff filed his Response in the form of a Letter Response on

    9 The Letter Response was dated April 12, 2021.  (See Dkt. No. 102.) 
                          II.  Discussion                                
    A.  Standard of Review                                               
    A complaint “does not need detailed factual allegations” to survive a motion to dismiss. 
Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  However, “a plaintiff’s obligation to 

provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a 
formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Id. (alteration and 
quotation marks omitted).  Said otherwise, compliance with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure “demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.”  
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  In practice, a complaint’s “[f]actual allegations 
must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.   
    “[O]nce a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of 
facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.”  Id. at 563.  A plaintiff need show “only 
enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 570.  If a plaintiff has 
not “nudged [his or her] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, the[] complaint 

must be dismissed.”  Id.; see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (“Determining whether a complaint 
states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing 
court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.  But where the well-pleaded facts do 
not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has 
alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” (citation omitted) 
(second alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2))); id. at 678–79 (“Rule 8 marks a 
notable and generous departure from the hypertechnical, code-pleading regime of a prior era, but 
it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than 
conclusions.”).                                                           
    In considering Moving Defendants’ Motion, the Court is required to “accept as true all of 
the factual allegations contained in the [Fourth AC].”  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 
(2007); see also Nielsen v. Rabin, 746 F.3d 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2014) (same).  Additionally, the Court 
must “draw[] all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.”  Daniel v. T & M Prot. Res., 

Inc., 992 F. Supp. 2d 302, 304 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Koch v. Christie’s Int’l PLC, 699 F.3d 
141, 145 (2d Cir. 2012)).  Furthermore, “[i]n adjudicating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a district court 
must confine its consideration to facts stated on the face of the complaint, in documents 
appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference, and to matters of which 
judicial notice may be taken.”  Leonard F. v. Isr. Disc. Bank of N.Y., 199 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir. 
1999) (quotation marks omitted).                                          
    The Court also undertakes its analysis in this case with a particular lens.  As the Supreme 
Court has stated, “[a] document filed pro se is to be liberally construed and a pro se complaint, 
however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted 
by lawyers.”  Erickson, 551 U.S. at 94 (quotation marks, citations, and italics omitted); see also 

Darby v. Greenman, 14 F.4th 124, 127–28 (2d Cir. 2021) (same) (citing Walker v. Schult, 717 
F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2013)).10  This means that a court must “‘interpret[] [a pro se complaint] 
to raise the strongest arguments that [it] suggest[s].’”  Sykes v. Bank of Am., 723 F.3d 399, 403 
(2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 2006)).  
Moreover, when a plaintiff proceeds pro se, the Court may consider “materials outside the 


    10 It could be argued that Plaintiff ought to be entitled to far less deference, having 
enjoyed the benefit of counsel’s assistance in the filing of prior complaints in this action.  Cf. 
CIT Grp./Com. Servs., Inc. v. Prisco, 640 F. Supp. 2d 401, 407 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (holding that 
pro se pleadings are not entitled to relaxed standard when an attorney has assisted in the drafting 
in some material way).  But for reasons set forth, even a relaxed standard does save Plaintiff’s 
claims in the Fourth AC from dismissal.                                   
complaint to the extent that they are consistent with the allegations in the complaint,” Alsaifullah 
v. Furco, No. 12-CV-2907, 2013 WL 3972514, at *4 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2013) (quotation 
marks omitted), including “documents that a pro se litigant attaches to his opposition 
papers,” Agu v. Rhea, No. 09-CV-4732, 2010 WL 5186839, at *4 n.6 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 

2010) (italics omitted).                                                  
    B.  Analysis                                                         
    Moving Defendants argue that: (1) many of Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred, (Mov. 
Defs.’ Mem. 8–11); (2) the Court has already made findings on Plaintiff’s claims, which 
constitutes the law of the case, (id. at 8); (3) Plaintiff failed to include his state law claims in his 
notice of claim, (id. at 10–11); (4) Plaintiff fails to state a prima facie claim for discrimination or 
a hostile work environment, (id. at 11–19); (5) Plaintiff fails to state a prima facie claim of 
retaliation, (id. at 19–21); and (5) Plaintiff fails to state a claim for negligent hiring, retention, 
and supervision, (id. at 21–22).  Moving Defendants also argue that one of the individual 
Defendants, Cokeley, should be dismissed, that Plaintiff fails to allege that the remaining 

individual Defendants acted with retaliatory animus, and that, in any event, the individual 
Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.  (Id. at 19–25.)           
         1.  Prior Dismissal of Two of Plaintiff’s Causes of Action      
    The Court previously dismissed with prejudice Plaintiff’s “Title VII claims against the 
individual Defendants, all claims against the Ramapo Police Department, and any claims for 
punitive damages against the Town or individual Defendants in their official capacities.”  (Op. 
42.)  As Moving Defendants observe, Plaintiff “removed Corbett and Holmes” from the case 
caption in the Fourth AC.  (Mov. Defs.’ Mem. 23.)  So, too, did Plaintiff remove Officers 
William Gravina and Al Gumbs as well as the Town of Ramapo Police Department.  (Compare 
TAC 1 (case caption) with Fourth AC 1 (case caption).)  Notwithstanding these limited removals, 
the remaining Defendants subject to the Fourth AC include the majority of those previously 
named in the TAC, including many individual Defendants.  With this in mind, the Court turns 
back to Plaintiff’s claims.                                               
    Plaintiff’s causes of action group all Defendants together for each claim.  (See, e.g., 

Fourth AC ¶ 69.)  Thus, the Court interprets each of those claims to be made against each of the 
Defendants named in the caption, meaning the causes of action filed under Title VII pertain to 
the individual defendants.  As stated above, the First Cause of Action (Retaliation in Violation of 
Title VII) against all Moving Defendants save for the Town of Ramapo have already been 
dismissed because “individual defendants cannot be held liable under Title VII.”  (Op. 22 (citing 
Davis-Bell v. Columbia Univ., 851 F. Supp. 2d 650, 687 (S.D.N.Y. 2012)).)  This reasoning 
applies to both the First Cause of Action as well as the Fourth Cause of Action (Discrimination 
and Harassment in Violation of Title VII).  See, e.g., Rojas v. Roman Cath. Diocese of Rochester, 
660 F.3d 98, 107 n.10 (2d Cir. 2011) (“[A]n individual defendant with supervisory control may 
not be held personally liable under Title VII.”); Perry v. State of N.Y. Dep’t of Lab., No. 02-CV-

7566, 2003 WL 22327887, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2003) (concluding that the “Second Circuit 
has unambiguously denied” holding individuals liable under Title VII).  Because this precedent 
continues to govern Plaintiff’s claims, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff’s First and 
Fourth Causes of Action.  See Denny v. Barber, 576 F.2d 465, 471 (2d Cir. 1978) (holding that 
the plaintiff was not entitled to “a third go-around); Jackson v. NYS Dep’t of Lab., No. 09-CV-
6608, 2012 WL 843631, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2012) (“Where, as here . . . the [c]ourt has 
explained in detail the defects in the original complaints, instructed plaintiff on how to rectify her 
claims and afforded her an opportunity to do so in a second amended complaint, dismissal with 
prejudice is justified.”).                                                
         2.  Statutes of Limitations                                     
              a.  Title VII                                              
    To the extent Plaintiff’s Title VII claims remain, i.e. solely against the Town, Moving 
Defendants argue that the Court has already made findings relating to their prior arguments that 
many of Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred.  (Mov. Defs.’ Mem. 8–9.)      
    “The law of the case doctrine commands that ‘when a court has ruled on an issue, that 

decision should generally be adhered to by that court in subsequent stages in the same case’ 
unless ‘cogent and compelling reasons militate otherwise.’”  Johnson v. Holder, 564 F.3d 95, 99 
(2d Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Quintieri, 306 F.3d 1217, 1225 (2d Cir. 2002)), cert. 
denied, 560 U.S. 919 (2010); see also In re PCH Assocs., 949 F.2d 585, 592 (2d Cir. 1991) 
(“Under the law of the case doctrine, a decision on an issue of law made at one stage of a case 
becomes binding precedent to be followed in subsequent stages of the same litigation.”).  “The 
law of the case doctrine is admittedly discretionary and does not limit a court’s power to 
reconsider its own decisions prior to final judgment.”  Virgin Atl. Airways, Ltd. v. Nat’l 
Mediation Bd., 956 F.2d 1245, 1255 (2d Cir. 1992); see also Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 

618 (1983) (“Law of the case directs a court’s discretion, it does not limit the tribunal’s power.”); 
First Nat’l Bank of Hollywood v. Am. Foam Rubber Corp., 530 F.2d 450, 453 n.3 (2d Cir. 1976) 
(“In this Circuit, the law of the case is a discretionary doctrine that need not be applied when no 
prejudice results from its omission.”), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 858 (1976).   
    The Court sees no reason to reverse its prior rulings on this issue.  As the Second Circuit 
has observed, “[t]he major grounds justifying reconsideration are an intervening change of 
controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent 
manifest injustice.”  Virgin Atl. Airways, 956 F.2d at 1255 (quoting marks omitted).  No such 
impetus is present.                                                       
    Plaintiff fails to substantively respond to Moving Defendants’ argument regarding the 
law of the case doctrine; Plaintiff instead responds in kind, accusing Defendants of initiating 
time-barred actions.  (Pl.’s Mem. 4.)  Plaintiff’s argument is as follows: the Rockland County 
Police Act “governs the functions of all police departments in Rockland County, dictates that 

‘ . . . charges shall not be brought more than sixty days after the time when the facts upon which 
such charges are based are known to the town board,’” and the charges against Plaintiff were 
drawn on March 10, 2016, which is 130 days from the final date at which Defendants allege 
Plaintiff committed any professional misconduct worthy of firing.  (Id.)  Plaintiff essentially 
makes the point that the Department, including several defendants therein, acted improperly by 
firing him after they were permitted to do so.  (Id.)                     
    This response fails to grapple with either of the Moving Defendants’ arguments with 
respect to whether Plaintiff’s Title VII claims are time-barred.  This issue—whether Defendants 
acted improperly pursuant to the laws governing Rockland County Policy activity—is not before 
the Court, and the Court therefore does not opine on it.  Thus, in effect, Plaintiff’s non-

responsive answer is a de facto concession of Defendant’s timeliness argument.  “A plaintiff 
effectively concedes a defendant’s arguments by his failure to respond to them.”  Felske v. 
Hirschmann, No. 10-CV-8899, 2012 WL 716632, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2012) (collecting 
cases); see also Lopez Canas v. Whitaker, No. 19-CV-6031, 2019 WL 2287789, at *5 (W.D.N.Y. 
May 29, 2019) (“It is well settled in this Circuit that a plaintiff effectively concedes a 
defendant’s arguments by his failure to respond to them” (alteration and quotation marks 
omitted)); Miles v. Walawender, No. 10-CV-973, 2013 WL 1908304, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. May 7, 
2013) (“[The] [p]laintiff’s opposing [m]emorandum of [l]aw does not respond to this argument, 
and effectively concedes these arguments by his failure to respond to them.” (alteration, citation, 
and quotation marks omitted)).  This alone favors granting Moving Defendants’ Motion on this 
claim.                                                                    
    Nevertheless, turning to the merits of whether Plaintiff’s Title VII claims are time-barred, 
the Court has reviewed its prior analysis, (see Op. 15–17), and sees no reason to upend it.  The 

Court will therefore continue to consider Plaintiff’s firing, which occurred on December 16, 
2016, (Fourth AC ¶ 33) as a “timely allegation of an adverse employment action” and will 
“consider [his] other allegations as ‘background evidence’ to determine whether that adverse 
action was the result of a discriminatory motive.” (Op. 17 (quoting Hagan v. City of New York, 
39 F. Supp. 3d 481, 496 n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 2014))).                           
              b.  Section 1983                                           
    In Plaintiff’s TAC, his First Cause of Action is titled “Retaliation in Violation of Section 
1981,” and the substance of the claim sounds in § 1981.  (TAC 20.)  The Court, following 
briefing on the matter, concluded that the claims are more appropriately considered under § 
1983.  (Op. 17–19.)  Following the Court’s Opinion, Plaintiff changed the title of the First Cause 
of Action of the Fourth AC to read “Retaliation in Violation of Section 1983,” but the text of this 

cause of action nevertheless cites § 1981.  (Fourth AC 16 & ¶¶ 66–69.)  Whether Plaintiff’s 
claims are brought under § 1981 or § 1983 therefore emerges once more.    
    Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s retaliation claims against a municipality and 
state actors are brought under § 1983, referencing the Court’s prior decision on this point.  (Mov. 
Defs.’ Mem. 9–10.)  Moving Defendants therefore argue that Plaintiff’s claims pre-dating 
January 28, 2015, are time-barred per its prior ruling.  (Id.)            
    As stated previously, Plaintiff fails to respond substantively to Moving Defendants’ 
argument that the Court has already decided this issue and that, notwithstanding this prior 
decision, the claims are time-barred.  (See Pl.’s Mem. 4.)                
    Putting aside Plaintiff’s apparent concession of this point, the Court concludes that its 
prior decision was correct and that these claims are properly brought under § 1983.  (See Op. 17–
19.)  Moreover, the Court remains of the opinion that Plaintiff’s “claims of discrete acts of 
retaliation and discrimination brought pursuant to § 1983 that occurred prior to January 28, 2015 

are time-barred” and “to the extent these allegations provide ‘context and support for the timely 
claims that Plaintiff asserts,’ the Court will consider them.”  (Op. 19 (quoting Allen, 51 F. Supp. 
3d at 510 n.2).)11                                                        
         3.  Failure to State a Claim for Discrimination Under Title VII and § 1983 
    Plaintiff brings claims for discrimination under Title VII, § 1983, and the NYSHRL.  
(Fourth AC ¶¶ 75–86.)  These claims are all evaluated using the same framework.  See Brown v. 
City of Syracuse, 673 F.3d 141, 150 (2d Cir. 2012) (deploying the McDonnell Douglas 
framework for race discrimination claims under Title VII and the NYSHRL); Ruiz v. County of 
Rockland, 609 F.3d 486, 491–92 (2d Cir. 2010) (same for § 1983 claims).   
    “To establish a claim of racial discrimination a claimant ‘must show: (1) he belonged to a 
protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position he held; (3) he suffered an adverse 

employment action; and (4) that the adverse employment action occurred under circumstances 

    11 Moving Defendants also assert that Plaintiff’s state law claims—which include the 
Third Cause of Action (retaliation in violation of the NYSHRL), Sixth Cause of Action 
(discrimination and harassment in violation of the NYSHRL), and Seventh Cause of Action 
(negligent hiring, retention, and supervision)—are similarly time-barred as a result of their notice 
mechanism.  (Mov. Defs.’ Mem. 10–11.)  Because the Court has dismissed the Fourth AC, the 
Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims and thus 
does not opine on the merits of this argument.  See Marcus v. AT&T Corp., 138 F.3d 46, 57 (2d 
Cir. 1998) (“In general, where the federal claims are dismissed before trial, the state claims 
should be dismissed as well.”); Thomas v. Grunberg 77 LLC, No. 15-CV-1925, 2017 WL 
3263141, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2017) (dismissing state claims where the federal claims had 
been dismissed as moot); Torres v. City of New York, 248 F. Supp. 2d 333, 334 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) 
(“Where the basis for pendent jurisdiction is dismissed, ordinarily so should the state law claims 
be dismissed.”).                                                          
giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.’”  Brown, 673 F.3d at 150 (quoting Holcomb 
v. Iona Coll., 521 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2008)); see also Salu v. Miranda, 830 F. App’x 341, 
345 (2d Cir. 2020) (summary order) (same); Hill v. Rayboy-Brauestein, 467 F. Supp. 2d 336, 350 
(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (same) (citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)).  

Once plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the “burden then must shift to the employer to 
articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee’s [adverse action].”  
McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.  “If the employer puts forth a legitimate, non-
discriminatory justification, the presumption drops out of the analysis and the plaintiff must 
establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer’s justification is a pretext for 
discrimination.”  Lenzi v. Systemax, Inc., 944 F.3d 97, 107–08 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting Legg v. 
Ulster County, 820 F.3d 67, 73–74 (2d Cir. 2016)).  For the reasons set forth, Plaintiff does not 
establish a prima facie case for discrimination.                          
    Plaintiff has established that he belongs to a protected class.  It is undisputed that Plaintiff 
“is an African–American . . . whose race places [him] in a protected class.”  Hill, 467 F. Supp. 2d 

at 350 (citing Norville v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir. 1999)).  (See also 
Fourth AC ¶ 26 (Plaintiff is an “African-American citizen, who immigrated from the Republic of 
Haiti”).)                                                                 
    Plaintiff has also established that he was qualified for the position in question.  The 
standard for one’s qualification to hold a position in a discrimination claim is “minimal.”  
Slattery v. Swiss Reinsurance Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 92 (2d Cir. 2001).  This question “should 
focus on the plaintiff’s competence and whether he possesses the basic skills necessary for 
performance of [the] job.”  Ruiz, 609 F.3d at 492 (quotation marks omitted) (alteration in 
original).  In light of Plaintiff’s military service, prior position as a correction officer, and law 
enforcement training, the Court finds Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that he was qualified for the 
job from which he was terminated.                                         
    Plaintiff’s termination constitutes an adverse employment action.  “An adverse 
employment action is a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment,” 

Torre v. Charter Commc’ns, Inc., 493 F. Supp. 3d 276, 286 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (citing 
Mathirampuzha v. Potter, 548 F.3d 70, 78 (2d Cir. 2008)), that rises above “‘a mere 
inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities,’” Brown, 673 F.3d at 150 (quoting Joseph 
v. Leavitt, 465 F.3d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 2006)).  Put another way, this standard is only met when an 
action is “of such quality or quantity that a reasonable employee would find the conditions of her 
employment altered for the worse.” Albuja v. Nat’l Broad. Co. Universal, Inc., 851 F. Supp. 2d 
599, 606 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Torres v. Pisano, 116 F.3d 625, 632 (2d Cir. 1997)).  As 
determined above, given the application of the statute of limitations, the only potential adverse 
employment actions are the order for Plaintiff to release his medical records and his subsequent 
termination.  Courts in the Second Circuit have explained that “[e]xamples of materially adverse 

changes include termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or 
salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material 
responsibilities, or other indices unique to a particular situation.”  Karupaiyan v. CVS Health 
Corp., No. 19-CV-8814, 2021 WL 4341132, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2021) (emphasis added) 
(quoting Terry v. Ashcroft, 336 F.3d 128, 138 (2d Cir. 2003)).  Thus, Plaintiff’s firing is an 
adverse employment action.                                                
    The demand that Plaintiff sign a HIPAA release, on the other hand, is not.  As the 
aforementioned examples make clear, an adverse event must have a tangible impact on the 
employee’s responsibilities, title, or compensation.  An inquiry brought about by suspicion of a 
rule violation bears no such resemblance to these categories of harms.  For that reason, the 
Second Circuit has held that being questioned by a supervisor—as well as a supervisor’s attempt 
to access an employee’s computer, an act arguably comparable to a request to review an 
employee’s medical records, as here—does not constitute an adverse event.  See Chang v. Safe 

Horizons, 254 F. App’x 838, 839 (2d Cir. 2007) (summary order) (holding, on a motion for 
summary judgment, that “oral and written warnings issued by [a plaintiff’s supervisor], [the 
plaintiff’s] being questioned by [her supervisor], and [the supervisor’s] attempt to access [the 
plaintiff’s] computer do not constitute materially adverse actions in the view of a reasonable 
employee” (quotation marks omitted)); see also Lee v. Verizon Wireless, Inc., No. 07-CV-532, 
2008 WL 4479410, at *7 (D. Conn. Sept. 26, 2008) (holding at the summary judgment stage that 
“questioning by supervisors, manipulation of an employee’s workspace and oral or written 
warnings based on documented company policy violations are not materially adverse actions in 
the view of a reasonable employee and constitute, at best, trivial harms which are not 
actionable.” (quotation marks omitted)); cf. Hoffman v. Baltimore Police Dep’t, 379 F. Supp. 2d 

778, 792 (D. Md. 2005) (concluding that “[t]he few courts that have considered whether an 
investigation, by itself, can constitute an adverse employment action have answered that question 
in the negative.”).                                                       
    In an analogous example—albeit one decided at the summary judgment stage—a court in 
this district found that “being asked to bring in a doctor’s note to substantiate a request for sick 
leave in compliance with [a government organization’s personnel] policy” was not an adverse 
event for purposes of discrimination.12  Blake v. Potter, No. 03-CV-7733, 2007 WL 2815637, at 


    12 “Claims of employment discrimination under [§] 1981 are analyzed under the same 
framework that applies to Title VII claims and claims under [§] 1983.”  Bermudez v. City of New 
York, 783 F. Supp. 2d 560, 576 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (collecting cases).        
*9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2007), aff’d, 330 F. App’x 232 (2d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 
1138 (2010).  Considering the applicable precedent in this Circuit as well as the tangible impact 
of the order itself, the Court finds that the order issued to Plaintiff to release narrowly tailored 
medical records in response to suspicion of a policy violation does not constitute an adverse 

employment action.  Thus, the sole adverse employment action at issue under which Plaintiff 
may make a discrimination claim is his termination.                       
    Plaintiff’s claims in this arena thus turn on whether his firing, “the adverse employment 
action[,] occurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.’”  
Brown, 673 F.3d at 150.  It is at this point that Plaintiff’s claim falters. 
    “To establish an inference of discrimination, a plaintiff must allege that []he was 
similarly situated in all material respects to the individuals with whom []he seeks to compare 
[him]self.”  Brown v. Daikin Am. Inc., 756 F.3d 219, 230 (2d Cir. 2014) (quotation marks 
omitted).  Plaintiff notes that he was under the care of the same doctors as other officers.  (Fourth 
AC ¶ 35.)  Plaintiff also asserts that he “has submitted many doctor’s notes previously which 

have all been acceptable.”  (Id. ¶ 41 (citing Fourth AC Ex. 4).)  But what Plaintiff submitted was 
in fact testimony of Matos regarding prior notes.  (See Fourth AC Ex. 4.)  There is no apples-to-
apples comparison to be made between otherwise analogous notes.  Absent such comparative 
exemplars, Plaintiff’s theory of discrimination is unsupported.  See Farooq v. N.Y.C. Health & 
Hosps. Corp., No. 19-CV-6294, 2020 WL 5018387, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 25, 2020) (concluding 
that failure to “identify comparators, let alone to provide any specificity as to [his] alleged 
comparators’ [similarities] is fatal to [his] claims” (quotation marks omitted) (collecting cases)). 
    Because Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead facts that give rise to an inference of 
discriminatory intent, Moving Defendants’ Motion with respect to Plaintiff’s Causes of Actions 
regarding an allegedly discriminatory workplace under Title VII and § 1983 is granted and 
Plaintiff’s correspondent causes of action are dismissed with prejudice.  See Shcherb v. Angi 
Homeservices Inc., No. 19-CV-367, 2020 WL 2571041, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2020) (“When 
a plaintiff does not correct the defects in an initial pleading through the filing of a more detailed 

amended complaint, the amended complaint may be dismissed with prejudice.” (quoting Liner v. 
Goord, 115 F. Supp. 2d 432, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 2000))).                        
         4.  Failure to State a Claim for a Hostile Work Environment Under Title VII and § 
           1983                                                          
    “To prevail on a hostile work environment claim under Title VII, ‘a plaintiff must first 
show that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the 
victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment.’”  Lewis v. N. Gen. Hosp., 502 
F. Supp. 2d 390, 402 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Feingold v. New York, 366 F.3d 138, 149 (2d 
Cir. 2004)).  “Second, a hostile work environment claim under Title VII requires a showing that 
the conduct occurred because of [the] plaintiff’s membership in a protected class.”  Id. (citing 
Brennan v. Metro. Opera Ass’n, 192 F.3d 310, 318 (2d Cir. 1999)).  “Finally, the plaintiff must 
demonstrate that a specific basis exists for imputing the conduct that created the hostile 
environment to the employer.”  Id. (citing Van Zant v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 80 F.3d 708, 
715 (2d Cir. 1996)).                                                      
    When deciding if a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of a hostile work 
environment, a court must “look[] at all the circumstances.  These may include the frequency of 

the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a 
mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work 
performance.”  Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993).  This inquiry has “both a 
subjective and an objective component.”  Lewis, 502 F. Supp. 2d at 402.  Not only is the Court to 
evaluate objective metrics such as the “frequency” of such actions, but it must also take into 
consideration “the employee’s psychological well-being,” which bears on “whether the plaintiff 
actually found the environment abusive.”  Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.         
    Plaintiff’s allegations convince the Court that the subjective prong of this inquiry has 

been satisfied.  As highlighted previously, Plaintiff alleges that his treatment left him “feeling 
degraded, unappreciated and not welcomed.”  (Fourth AC ¶ 98.)  Plaintiff has also described his 
experience on the police force, as a result of the allegedly hostile work environment, as 
“isolating” and likening his status to one of “an escaped convict posing as a police officer.”  (Id.)  
Plaintiff thus meets this subjective mark.                                
    Unfortunately for Plaintiff, precedent in the Second Circuit neuters his claim with respect 
to the objective inquiry.  To satisfy this standard, “[t]he incidents must be repeated and 
continuous; isolated acts or occasional episodes will not merit relief.”  Kotcher v. Rosa & 
Sullivan Appliance Ctr., Inc., 957 F.2d 59, 62 (2d Cir. 1992) (citing Carrero v. N.Y.C. Hous. 
Auth., 890 F.2d 569, 577 (2d Cir. 1989)).  Additionally, the events in question must evince a 

“racial overtone.”  Gong v. City Univ. of N.Y., 846 F. App’x 6, 9 (2d Cir. 2021) (summary order).  
Acts of individualized punishment, however severe or disproportionate, do not give rise to a 
hostile work environment claim if they lack a connection to the characteristic on which Plaintiff 
alleges discrimination.  See Pease v. City of New York, No. 19-CV-7693, 2021 WL 2651400, at 
*13 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2021) (discarding events put forward in a hostile work environment 
claim that fail to “support[] the inference that these actions were motivated by discriminatory 
animus rather than, e.g., dissatisfaction with [the] [p]laintiff’s performance of his duties”).  As 
the Second Circuit has explained:                                         
    Everyone  can  be  characterized  by  sex,  race,  ethnicity  or  (real  or  perceived) 
    disability; and many bosses are harsh, unjust, and rude.  It is therefore important in 
    hostile work environment cases to exclude from consideration personnel decisions 
    that  lack  a  linkage  or  correlation  to  the  claimed  ground  of  discrimination.  
    Otherwise, the federal courts will become a court of personnel appeals. 
Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 377 (2d Cir. 2002).                     
    Plaintiff directs the Court to 12 discrete episodes besides the events involving Plaintiff’s 
doctors’ notes: (1) Weidel’s investigation into Plaintiff’s military service while attending the 
police academy in 2002, (Fourth AC ¶ 95); (2) Corbett’s 2004 tirade against Plaintiff, (id. ¶ 99); 
(3) Corbett’s negative report regarding Plaintiff’s handwriting, Plaintiff’s subsequent 
improvement, the department’s failure to recognize said improvements, and Reynar’s speculation 
that Plaintiff no longer wrote his own reports, (id. ¶¶ 97, 98, 42); (4) Lampert’s 2005 report as to 
Plaintiff’s security infraction in the holding cell, (id. ¶ 100); (5) Franklin’s diatribe the following 
year against Plaintiff for having written his friend a ticket, (id. ¶ 101); (6) the department’s 2007 
splitting of Sector Two only after a white officer complained that it was too large, (id. ¶ 104); 
(7) the report the same year by an unnamed officer regarding Plaintiff’s shoveling his driveway 
on a sick day, (id. ¶ 102); (8) the department’s scheduling accommodations for a newly hired 
Jewish officer’s religious obligations the following year and its comparably poor 

accommodations for Plaintiff’s request, (id. ¶ 105); (9), Plaintiff’s use of “too many 
rounds . . . to euthanize an injured animal” in 2010, (id. ¶ 107); (10) Franklin’s deleting of tickets 
Plaintiff previously issued as well as the department’s reprimand of Plaintiff and its ordering 
Plaintiff to undergo a psychological test, (id. ¶ 108); (11) Plaintiff’s refusal in 2013 to provide 
his personal email address for a political election, (id. ¶ 110); and (12) Plaintiff’s 2014 
evaluation failing to note particular achievements and excellent performance, (id. ¶ 111). 
              i.  Events That Lack a Connection to Any Protected Class   
    Many of the events put forward by Plaintiff lack any connection to Plaintiff’s national 
origin, political affiliations, race, or religion.  Where a plaintiff fails to allege facts connecting 
actions to an animus related to one’s national origin, political affiliations, race, or religion, such 
allegations are “too conclusory to permit an inference of discriminatory animus.”  Trujillo v. City 
of New York, No. 14-CV-8501, 2016 WL 10703308, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2016) (collecting 
cases), aff’d, 696 F. App’x 560 (2d Cir. 2017).  Specifically, Plaintiff does not allege any facts 

that connect his national origin, political affiliation, race, or religion to the following incidents: 
whether he stepped into the holding cell in violation of department policy, (Fourth AC ¶ 100); 
whether Plaintiff was correct in ticketing Franklin’s friend and whether Franklin was wrong to 
berate Plaintiff for having done so, (id. ¶ 101); whether he was in violation of department policy 
for shoveling snow while taking a sick day, (id. ¶ 102); whether the Department incorrectly 
failed to appreciate his improvements and achievements in 2004 and 2014, respectively (id. ¶¶ 
98, 111); whether he used an inappropriate method to euthanize an animal, (id. ¶ 107); and 
whether it was appropriate for him to undergo a psychological exam because he accurately saw 
tickets were deleted.  See Salerno v. Town of Bedford, No. 05-CV-7293, 2008 WL 5101185, at 
*8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2008) (holding that, absent additional proof of racial animus, “[a]llegations 

of negative job evaluations or excessive reprimands are insufficient to establish a hostile 
environment claim”).  Nothing Plaintiff avers suggests that these incidents were a result of 
anything other than a “personality conflict[] between employees,” which is “not the business of 
the federal courts.”  Vore v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co., 32 F.3d 1161, 1162 (7th Cir. 1994); see also 
Pacheco v. N.Y. Presbyterian Hosp., 593 F. Supp. 2d 599, 624 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“Title VII does 
not create a ‘general civility code.’” (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 
U.S. 75, 81 (1998))).  Therefore, these events do not factor into the Court’s calculus for a hostile 
work environment claim on any protected basis.                            
              ii.  Isolated Events That Tangentially Connect to National Origin, Political 
              Actions, Race, and Religion Are Insufficiently Severe and Infrequent to 
              Have Created a Hostile Work Environment                    
    The remaining events are too disparate or insufficiently severe to give rise to a hostile 
work environment claim on any potential grounds.  One event offers, at best, a cursory 
connection to Plaintiff’s national origin: the department’s investigation into his background 
while in the police academy.  (Fourth AC ¶ 95.)  There, Plaintiff alleges only that the department 
was unable to verify his background, including his military service, and thus asked if he in fact 
served in the military of the country in which he was born.  This fails to give rise to an inference 
that Plaintiff was discriminated against based on his national origin.  Rather, the questions are 
“reasonably related” to Plaintiff’s hiring, including whether he was honest or lied on his 
application following the department’s good faith but unsuccessful effort to verify his military 
service.  Kho v. N.Y. & Presbyterian Hosp., 344 F. Supp. 3d 705, 722 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (finding 
that comments or questions “reasonably related to [an employee’s] ability to adequately perform 
her job” militates against an inference of discrimination).  Moreover, even if the Court concluded 
that this questioning did give rise to harassment, this isolated incident does not meet the Second 

Circuit’s standard of “pervasive or continuous” conduct.  Costello v. N.Y. State Nurses Ass’n, 
783 F. Supp. 2d 656, 680 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); see Alfano, 294 F.3d at 379–80 (holding that an 
employee could not establish a hostile work environment based on five relatively minor incidents 
of harassment over four years, including several that the employer could not remedy due to the 
perpetrator’s anonymity).  Therefore, the investigation as to Plaintiff’s military service, even 
when read in concert with Plaintiff’s firing, does not give rise to a hostile work environment 
claim on the basis of Plaintiff’s national origin.                        
    The same can be said about Plaintiff’s claim for a hostile work environment due to his 
religion.  The only event Plaintiff asserts regarding his religion is the allegedly inferior treatment 
of his religious accommodation request compared to that of a newly hired Jewish officer who 
received a religious accommodation.  (Fourth AC ¶ 105.)  Plaintiff concedes that his request was 
ultimately granted, albeit it after a slight delay and with one additional condition.  (Id.)  Thus, the 
Court does not find that this constitutes harassment.  But, once again, even if the Court were to 

assume arguendo that it were, this lone episode “does not come close to the level of harassment 
courts in this circuit have found to be ‘extraordinarily severe.’”  Yan v. Ziba Mode Inc., No. 15-
CV-47, 2016 WL 1276456, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2016) (quoting Albert-Roberts v. GGG 
Constr., LLC, 542 F. App’x 62, 64 (2d Cir. 2013)).                        
    Another lone event speaks to Plaintiff’s political participation.13  Specifically, Plaintiff 
alleges that his refusal to engage in certain political activities “generated a wave of 
discriminatory and retaliatory backlash, up to and including Plaintiff’s termination.”  (Fourth AC 
¶ 110.)  Again, this single episode of alleged hostility meets neither the severity nor frequency 
threshold this Circuit has established.  See Alfano, 294 F.3d at 379–80 (holding that an employee 
could not establish a hostile work environment based on five relatively minor incidents of 

harassment over four years).  Therefore, Plaintiff cannot plausibly plead a hostile work 
environment on the basis of his political actions or affiliation.         

    13 Plaintiff did not specifically name political affiliation or action as a ground for his 
hostile work environment claim.  However, as noted, the Court must read pro se pleadings “‘to 
raise the strongest arguments they suggest.’”  Hill v. City of New York, 820 F. App’x 86, 87 (2d 
Cir. 2020) (summary order) (quoting McLeod v. Jewish Guild for the Blind, 864 F.3d 154, 156 
(2d Cir. 2017)).  Attacks or retaliation as a result of one’s political affiliation is often evaluated 
on the basis of § 1983 claim for sake of a deprivation of one’s First Amendment rights.  Kohutka 
v. Town of Hempstead, 994 F. Supp. 2d 305, 317–22 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (evaluating whether an 
employee was retaliated against for sake of her political affiliations).  But because Plaintiff’s 
claims for retaliation under § 1983 were already dismissed with prejudice, see II.B.2.b, the Court 
examines this potential theory on Plaintiff’s behalf.  See Kohutka, 994 F. Supp. 2d at 326–29 
(adjudicating municipality defendant’s motion for summary judgment and finding that a material 
fact existed regarding whether an employee faced a hostile work environment for sake of her 
political affiliations and actions).                                      
    The two remaining incidents touch on Plaintiff’s race: Corbett’s 2004 outburst that 
implicated Plaintiff’s race, (see Fourth AC ¶ 99), and the Department’s actions in 2007 to 
reprimand Plaintiff for having raised objection to the size of Sector Two only to then break up 
Sector Two when a white officer raised analogous objections, (id. ¶ 104).  These two incidents, 

when viewed together with Plaintiff’s filing, are still “too few [and] too separate in time” to 
establish an abusive or hostile working environment.  Alfano, 294 F.3d at 380; see also Raspardo 
v. Carlone, 770 F.3d 97, 114 (2d Cir. 2014) (“The incidents complained of must be more than 
episodic; they must be sufficiently continuous and concerted in order to be deemed pervasive.” 
(quotation marks omitted)).  Indeed, the Second Circuit has previously held that “five incidents 
over a four-year period” were not sufficient to establish a hostile workplace.  Alfano, 294 F.3d at 
380.  Moreover, the incidents—totaling two over the course of a 15-year career, and which were 
made three years apart from one another—were too temporally disconnected to sustain Plaintiff’s 
claim.  See Kalola v. Int’l Bus. Machines Corp., No. 13-CV-7339, 2015 WL 861718, at *9 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2015) (“Two discriminatory comments, made four years apart, over the course 

of a decade of employment, are insufficient to sustain a hostile work environment claim.”).  
Thus, even construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, these isolated events years 
apart do not evince a workplace “permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and 
insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment 
and create an abusive working environment.”  Anderson v. New York City Dep’t of Fin., No. 19-
CV-7971, 2020 WL 1922624, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 2020) (quoting Gorzynski v. JetBlue 
Airways Corp., 596 F.3d 93, 102 (2d Cir. 2010)).                          
    Because discriminatory conduct must be sufficiently pervasive and hostile for Plaintiff’s 
hostile work environment claim to survive, Moving Defendants’ Motion with respect to 
Plaintiff’s claims of this kind is granted.  Given that this is the first adjudication of Plaintiff’s 
claim for a hostile work environment on the merits, this dismissal is without prejudice.  
         5.  Plaintiff Failed to State a Claim for Retaliation Under Title VII and Section 
           1983                                                          
    Plaintiff’s claims for retaliation remain only against the Town of Ramapo.  Moving 
Defendants are correct that “this claim is no different from that which this Court rejected when it 
dismissed the Third Amended Complaint.”  (Mov. Defs.’ Mem. 21.)  Plaintiff’s Fourth AC has 
not cured its previous deficiencies regarding connecting the protected activities to his 
termination, be it directly or indirectly, (Op. 27–31), nor its deficiencies regarding the level of 
adversity the actions posed, (id. at 31–38).  Because Plaintiff has raised these claims before and 

failed to rectify the inadequacies the Court previously identified, Plaintiff’s claims for retaliation 
under Title VII and § 1983 are dismissed with prejudice.  See Haber v. EOS CCA, No. 20-CV-
6637, 2021 WL 4429501, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2021) (“[B]ecause [the] [p]laintiff has had 
ample notice of the deficiencies in his complaint but has failed to rectify them, the [c]ourt will 
dismiss with prejudice and deny leave to amend.”).                        
                          III.  Conclusion                               
    For the foregoing reasons, Moving Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss is granted.  Because 
this is the first adjudication of Plaintiff’s claims of a hostile work environment on the merits, the 
dismissal of related claims is without prejudice.  The remaining claims, having been previously 
adjudicated, are dismissed with prejudice.  If Plaintiff wishes to file a fifth amended complaint 

addressing the deficiencies discussed in this Opinion & Order with respect to claims dismissed 
without prejudice Plaintiff must do so within 30 days of the date of this Opinion & Order.  
Plaintiff is advised that the fifth amended complaint will replace, not supplement, all prior 
complaints.  The fifth amended complaint must contain all of the claims, factual allegations, and 
exhibits that Plaintiff wishes the Court to consider.  If Plaintiff fails to abide by the 30-day 
deadline, the remaining claims may be dismissed with prejudice.           
    The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the pending Motion, (Dkt. No. 99), and mail a 
copy of this Opinion & Order to Plaintiff.                                

SO ORDERED.

KENNETH M. KARAS, United States District Judge:                           
    Plaintiff Ernst Theodore Tenemille (“Plaintiff”) brings this Action against the Town of 
Ramapo (the “Town” or “Ramapo”), Town of Ramapo Police Department (the “Police 
Department”), former Town Supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence (“St. Lawrence”), Councilman 
Patrick Withers (“Withers”), Chief of Police Bradley R. Weidel (“Weidel”), Chief of Staff 
Thomas Cokeley (“Cokeley”), Police Lieutenant (“Lt.”) David Holmes (“Holmes”), former 
Administrative Lt. William Gravina (“Gravina”), Squad Lt. Daniel Hyman (“Hyman”), Detective 
Sergeant (“Sgt.”) Brian Corbett (“Corbett”), Squad Sgt. Salomon Matos (“Matos”), Desk Sgt. 
Christopher Franklin (“Franklin”), and Police Sgt. Al Gumbs (“Gumbs”), alleging that 
Defendants retaliated against him on the basis of his race, color, national origin, and religion, in 
violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), 42 U.S.C. § 200e, et seq.; 42 
U.S.C. § 1981; and New York State Human Rights Law (“NYSHRL”), N.Y. Exec. Law § 290, et 

seq.  (See generally Third Am. Compl. (“TAC”) (Dkt. No. 67).)  Before the Court is a Motion To 
Dismiss (the “Motion”), pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), filed by the 
Town, the Police Department, Weidel, Cokeley, Holmes, Hyman, Corbett, Matos, and Franklin 
(the “Moving Defendants”).  (Not. of Mot. (Dkt. No. 72).)1  For the reasons discussed below, the 
Motion is granted.                                                        
                          I.  Background                                 
    A.  Factual Background                                               
    The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff’s TAC and are assumed to be true for the 
purpose of resolving the instant Motion.                                  
    Plaintiff is a 47-year-old Haitian American who immigrated to the United States from 

Haiti in 1984.  (TAC ¶ 29.)  After graduating from high school in 1988, Plaintiff joined the U.S. 
Navy, from which he was honorably discharged in 1997.  (Id. ¶¶ 29–30.)  Plaintiff then 
graduated from State University of New York (“SUNY”) Rockland Community College in 1999 
with an associate’s degree in criminal justice and from SUNY Purchase in May 2017 with a 
bachelor’s degree in liberal studies and a minor in psychology.  (Id. ¶ 30.) 


    1 Defendants St. Lawrence, Withers, Gravina, and Gumbs have not appeared in this 
Action, and, according to Moving Defendants, “[u]pon information and belief,” they were never 
served.  (Moving Defs.’ Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. (“Moving Defs.’ Mem.”) 19 n.7 (Dkt. 
No. 74).)  Plaintiff filed affidavits of service indicating that these Defendants were served at 
Ramapo’s Town Hall, (Dkt. Nos. 6, 7, 11, 16), but Moving Defendants represent that these 
Defendants were not associated with or employed by the Town when service occurred, (Moving 
Defs.’ Mem. 19 n.7).                                                      
    In 2000, Plaintiff joined the Rockland Sheriff’s Department as a Correction Officer.  (Id. 
¶ 31.)  In 2002, he was hired by the Town as a police officer.  (Id.)  In the same year, Plaintiff 
attended the Rockland County Police Academy.  (Id. ¶ 34.)  While there, he was “abruptly pulled 
out of his training” and asked questions about alleged inaccuracies in his background report.  

(Id.)  According to Plaintiff, the detectives who conducted his background check for the Police 
Department could not confirm his service with the Navy, and claimed that the copy of the “U.S. 
Navy service discharge form (DD-214)” provided by Plaintiff was fraudulent.  (Id.)  Weidel, 
who was an administrative sergeant at the time, led this investigation, and questioned whether 
Plaintiff had instead served in the Republic of Haiti’s Navy and whether Plaintiff had falsified 
information on his application, including his age.  (Id. ¶¶ 34–35.)  Plaintiff was “in fear of losing 
his employment” due to this incident.  (Id. ¶ 35.)  However, the information on Plaintiff’s 
application was confirmed, but no disciplinary action was taken against Weidel or the detectives 
who performed the investigation.  (Id. ¶¶ 35–36.)                         
    In December 2004, Plaintiff heard Corbett, who is white, engage in a “heated rant” 

against him, during which Corbett stated that Plaintiff “d[idn’t] belong” at the Police 
Department, and that he “need[ed] to go back to where he came from if they will have him.”  (Id. 
¶¶ 37–38 (quotation marks omitted).)  Corbett then stated that “they [African Americans] only 
have [two-fifths] of a brain anyway.”  (Id. ¶ 38 (first alteration in original) (quotation marks 
omitted).)  Plaintiff complained to his supervisors about these statements, but Corbett was 
promoted shortly after this incident and was not “reprimanded or disciplined in any way.”  (Id. 
¶ 39.)                                                                    
    Plaintiff was also “continually advised that he needed to improve his report writing 
skills,” and was told that he had “illegible handwriting.”  (Id. ¶ 40 (quotation marks omitted).)  
Corbett was Plaintiff’s immediate supervisor at the time.  (Id.)  Plaintiff turned in a report on a 
domestic violence incident to Corbett that contained several errors that had been covered with 
white-out, and Plaintiff asked Corbett if he could re-copy the report.  (Id.)  Corbett replied that 
the report was fine, and ultimately reviewed and approved it.  (Id.)  However, the same report 

was later flagged “further up the chain of command” as “messy and unprofessional,” and Corbett 
then wrote up Plaintiff for “turning in a messy report,” despite his earlier approval.  (Id. 
(quotation marks omitted).)  Plaintiff was then required to retake a “videotaped[] course on 
report writing,” which he had already taken and passed at the Rockland County Police Academy.  
(Id. ¶ 41.)  Plaintiff alleges that Corbett “knowingly insist[ed] that [the] domestic report be 
pushed up the chain of command,” which resulted in a “green sheet (supervisory contact 
report),” and was raised with Plaintiff’s supervisors.  (Id.)  According to Plaintiff, this green 
sheet was “used as a basis for the actions, which led to [Plaintiff’s] termination” in 2016.  (Id.) 
    Due to the complaints he received about his handwriting, Plaintiff began typing his 
reports.  (Id. ¶ 40.)  Soon after the incident with the report given to Corbett, Holmes summoned 

Plaintiff to speak to him with Sgt. Reynar, and “expressed surprise” at the improved quality of 
Plaintiff’s reports.  (Id. ¶ 42.)  During this meeting, Holmes speculated that “perhaps [Plaintiff] 
was having his wife complete the reports for him.”  (Id. (quotation marks omitted).)  
Additionally, Plaintiff’s annual evaluation did not include mention of his improved reports.  (Id.)  
Generally, Plaintiff alleges that he was “constantly under-evaluated[,] . . . all in . . . [D]efendants’ 
concerted effort to bolster the . . . Police Department’s aim of terminating him,” and that he 
frequently received lower scores than “a majority of [w]hite officers whose productivity were 
[sic] inferior to his.”  (Id. ¶ 43.)  Instead, Defendants engaged in a pattern of “outright ignoring 
[Plaintiff’s] positive accomplishments,” while other officers received awards for similar 
accomplishments, and of “highlighting mistakes [for which] most [w]hite officers at worst 
received warnings.”  (Id. ¶ 44.)  For example, in 2004, Plaintiff’s annual evaluation did not 
mention that he had received a “commendation letter for community service” he performed at 
SUNY Rockland Community College, and even though Plaintiff worked 201 shifts, during 

which he wrote “numerous reports” and made “numerous arrests,” he still received an 
unsatisfactory evaluation, and his termination was recommended.  (Id. ¶¶ 44–46.)  During this 
time, he was one of four African-American police officers at the Police Department, and the only 
one of Haitian descent.  (Id. ¶ 47.)                                      
    In 2005, Plaintiff was written up by now-retired Lt. Leslie Lampert (“Lampert”) for 
“entering a holding cell while armed,” which, based on camera footage, was an inaccurate 
allegation.  (Id. ¶ 48.)  This write-up remained in Plaintiff’s personnel file and was used by the 
Town in 2016 to justify Plaintiff’s termination.  (Id.)  In 2006, Franklin, a white male officer, 
“berated” Plaintiff in front of other officers for a “routine” traffic ticket issued to one of 
Franklin’s friends.  (Id. ¶¶ 49, 61.)  Although Plaintiff complained about this encounter, Franklin 

was not reprimanded and was promoted shortly after.  (Id. ¶ 50.)          
    The following year, Plaintiff was assigned to cover Sector Two, an area that includes the 
Police Station and the Town Court.  (Id. ¶ 51.)  Plaintiff found that the workload for this sector 
was heavy, and “often complained . . . and advised” that Sector Two should be split between 
multiple officers.  (Id.)  In response, Plaintiff was “advised to manage his time better” and 
“reprimanded for not being able to keep up with his workflow.”  (Id.)  However, when Plaintiff 
was ultimately transferred to a different section of the Town, a white police officer took over 
Sector Two, and it was deemed to be too large of a workload for one officer and split into two 
sectors.  (Id. ¶ 52.)  The reprimand letters Plaintiff received were not retracted, and they 
“resurfaced” during his ultimate termination.  (Id.)                      
    Also in 2007, Plaintiff had a two-year old child, and his wife was pregnant with another 
child.  (Id. ¶ 53.)  Plaintiff took a day of sick leave, and he was seen shoveling his driveway, 

which “led to accusations that [Plaintiff] was abusing his sick leave.”  (Id. ¶ 54.)  Plaintiff was 
“served with disciplinary charges and penalized,” and received “low marks” on his annual 
evaluation as a result.  (Id.)  Prior to this day, Plaintiff had “rarely used sick leave,” and was 
“commended many times for going years” without taking a day off.  (Id. ¶ 53.)  This incident 
was also raised during Plaintiff’s later termination.  (Id. ¶ 54.)        
    In 2008, Plaintiff took a personal day that he “did not have available,” and was written up 
for “[m]isuse of [a]ccumulated [t]ime.”  (Id. ¶ 55.)  In September 2008, Plaintiff filed a grievance 
“in connection with securing a modified schedule for religious observance.”  (Id.)  Three months 
earlier, a white female officer had done the same.  (Id.)  In 2009, Plaintiff filed an “EEOC 
Complaint (520-2009-00006)” against the Town, which “highlighted the disparities in the way 

that the religious observations were handled between [Plaintiff] and the white female officer” 
and documented other incidents, such as Corbett’s 2004 remark.  (Id. ¶ 56.)  On November 30, 
2010, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a right to sue letter, but 
Plaintiff did not file a lawsuit because he “hoped that the threat of a lawsuit would change the 
culture of the [P]olice [D]epartment.”  (Id. ¶ 57.)                       
    In May 2010, Plaintiff filed a police report about an au pair he had terminated, and who 
left his house with a set of Plaintiff’s house and car keys.  (Id. ¶ 58.)  The Police Department did 
not try to contact the au pair, and did not investigate Plaintiff’s report until he complained to a 
supervisor about the case, which was handled by Gumbs.  (Id.)  According to Plaintiff, Gumbs 
told other officers that Plaintiff “likely tried to cheat the [a]u [p]air out of her wages.”  (Id. 
(quotation marks omitted).)                                               
    One month later, Plaintiff was again written up in a report alleging that he “us[ed] too 
many rounds . . . to euthanize an injured animal.”  (Id. ¶ 59.)  Although the Town does not have a 

policy on euthanizing animals, and Plaintiff had explained that he “felt obligated” to end the 
animal’s suffering after he fired an initial round, Plaintiff underwent “remedial firearms 
training[,] []which he passed with excellence[.]”  (Id.)  The report about this incident and the 
“green sheet associated with it” remained a part of Plaintiff’s personnel file and were referenced 
when he was later terminated from the Police Department.  (Id.)           
    In December 2012, Plaintiff noticed that traffic tickets he had issued were deleted from 
the records of the Town and Police Department, and none of Plaintiff’s supervisors knew what 
had happened to them.  (Id. ¶ 60.)  Plaintiff lodged a written complaint, for which he was 
“severely reprimanded, sanctioned[,] and . . . was subjected to a second psychological evaluation 
and test.”  (Id.)2  This written report was also used in support of Plaintiff’s ultimate termination.  

(Id. ¶ 61.)  It was later discovered that Franklin was responsible for the deletion of the tickets, 
but Franklin was “minimally reprimanded,” was not required to undergo a “second psychological 
test,” and was recently promoted by the Police Department.  (Id.)         
    In September 2013, “then PBA president (and now)[] Detective Dennis Procter” used the 
Police Department’s system to solicit personal e-mail addresses of officers “for the political 
benefit of . . . Withers,” who was campaigning for re-election as councilman.  (Id. ¶ 62.)  
Plaintiff was the only officer who declined to provide his email address, which “generated a 


    2 Plaintiff does not appear to allege when an initial psychological evaluation took place.  
(See generally TAC.)                                                      
wave of discriminatory and retaliatory backlash” until Plaintiff was terminated in 2016.  (Id.)  
Plaintiff alleges that Withers “played a decisive role” in this reaction.  (Id.) 
    During Plaintiff’s annual evaluation in 2014, which was delivered by Hyman, it was not 
mentioned that Plaintiff had stopped an attempted suicide until he protested.  (Id. ¶ 63.)  The 

evaluation also noted that Plaintiff had had the fourth largest number of arrests in 2014, despite 
being injured and unable to work for a month, and that he was recommended for a “Lifesaving 
Award.”  (Id.)  Despite these accomplishments, Plaintiff received a rating of “[a]verage” for the 
year, and he never received the “Lifesaving Award.”  (Id.)  Further, “commendation letters” 
Plaintiff received were omitted from his evaluation, and instead, his evaluation noted that 
Plaintiff was written up when he responded, “Great idea,” to an e-mail sent by Weidel, because 
Plaintiff “should have known that no response [to the e-mail] was necessary.”  (Id. (quotation 
marks omitted).)                                                          
    In 2015, Plaintiff worked until December 1 but did not receive an evaluation for the year, 
despite the fact that he received three “commendation letters for . . . superior performance,” 

including a letter speaking to the “major role” he played in a “gang assault” case.  (Id. ¶¶ 65–66.)  
Instead, in 2015, the process for terminating Plaintiff began, and “hostility [toward Plaintiff] 
further spiked” after he put a bumper sticker reading “Yes.  I voted Obama” on his personal 
vehicle.  (Id. ¶ 66 (quotation marks omitted).)  On December 1, 2015, Plaintiff received from 
Matos a written order to sign, approve, notarize, and return within 24 hours a Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) release form, which Plaintiff accepted.  (Id. 
¶ 67.)3  If Plaintiff did not comply, he would face disciplinary action.  (Id. ¶ 73.)  The order was 


    3 Plaintiff later alleges that he was presented with this order on November 30, 2015.  (Id. 
¶ 73.)                                                                    
issued at 11:40 p.m., and Plaintiff returned to request the HIPAA form from Matos five minutes 
later.  (Id.)  Former “PBA president” Detective Greg Whalen (“Whalen”) witnessed Plaintiff ask 
for the form.  (Id. ¶ 76.)  However, Matos informed Plaintiff that it was “out of his hands” and 
that Weidel was on the way to see him.  (Id. ¶ 73 (alteration and quotation marks omitted).)  

Plaintiff was deemed “[u]nwilling to [c]omply” with the order and placed on administrative 
leave 40 minutes later by Weidel, “who assumed that [Plaintiff] had no intention” of following 
the order to sign the HIPAA form.  (Id. ¶¶ 67, 74 (quotation marks omitted).)  Plaintiff alleges 
that he was the only officer in the Town ever required to sign a HIPAA release due to “an 
uncontested regular sick day.”  (Id. ¶ 68.)                               
    On December 16, 2015, Plaintiff was summoned to the Town’s police headquarters and 
was “interrogated for nearly [eight] hours” by Hyman and Lt. Colbath.  (Id. ¶ 69.)  A 
stenographer, the “PBA president,” and the “PBA attorney” were also present at the time, and the 
session was recorded.  (Id.)  Plaintiff had “no influential counsel representing him” during this 
process, and, according to Plaintiff, Hyman ignored the “many objections of the PBA Attorney” 

to questions that “prob[ed] as far back as . . . 2004 for answers . . . [that] would serve to facilitate 
the Town’s aim of terminating [Plaintiff].”  (Id.)  Plaintiff was given another HIPAA release 
form at the end of the day and was told to sign, notarize, and return it within 24 hours, which 
Plaintiff did.  (Id.)  Plaintiff was again “interrogated” the following day.  (Id. ¶ 70.)  
    On March 11, 2016, Plaintiff received “disciplinary charges” which “relied heavily” on 
the “unlawful interrogation” that had taken place the previous December.  (Id. ¶ 71.)  On May 5, 
2016, while Weidel was “in command,” Plaintiff was approved for an award for “Excellent 
Police Service,” despite being suspended at the time.  (Id. ¶ 65.)  However, Plaintiff did not 
receive this award, which he alleges was due to “deeply rooted . . . hatred for [Plaintiff] due to 
his race, country of origin[,] and religion.”  (Id.)                      
    On June 21, 2016, the first hearing related to Plaintiff’s disciplinary charges took place, 
which was overseen by Hearing Officer William E. Sherwood (“Sherwood”).  (Id. ¶ 72.)  During 

this hearing, Hyman explained that the doctor’s notes Plaintiff submitted in support of an earlier 
sick day were “not acceptable” and that the Town ultimately ordered Plaintiff to sign, notarize, 
and return within 24 hours a HIPAA release form to gain access to Plaintiff’s medical records.  
(Id. ¶¶ 72, 74 (quotation marks omitted).)  According to Plaintiff, Hyman had determined that 
Plaintiff’s doctor’s interpretations of the words “diagnosis” and “prognosis” were incorrect after 
consulting Wikipedia and also determined from “Wikipedia or Google” that the doctor’s use of 
the acronym “N.B.” “constitute[d] a threat” and “form[ed] what became the basis for one more 
charge against [Plaintiff].”  (Id. ¶¶ 74, 76 (quotation marks omitted).)  Plaintiff alleges that the 
Town removed 50 pages of the transcript from the hearing, which included Hyman’s responses, 
before submitting it to Sherwood, who pointed out that the pages had been removed.  (Id. ¶¶ 74–

75.)  The page removal was not “properly mentioned or questioned” during the hearing, and 
Whalen, who witnessed Plaintiff “willingly request[]” the HIPAA form from Matos, was not 
interviewed.  (Id. ¶¶ 76–77.)  On December 15, 2016, Plaintiff was terminated from the Police 
Department, after the Town Council adopted the recommendations of the “hearing officers.”  (Id. 
¶ 75.)                                                                    
    On October 4, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC, alleging “unlawful 
discriminatory employment practices because of race/color, national origin, age, sex, and 
religion.”  (Id. ¶ 25.)  On October 30, 2017, the EEOC “rendered a determination finding to 
support the allegations of the October 4[,] 2017 [c]omplaint” and issued to Plaintiff a right-to-sue 
letter.  (Id. ¶¶ 25–26.)                                                  
    Plaintiff alleges that during the course of his employment, he was “continually singled 
out by other employees and managers at the . . . Police Department . . . and subjected to a 

constant bombardment of discrimination and harassment because of his race/color, national 
origin[,] and religion.”  (Id. ¶ 36.)  He also claims that he was “continually reprimanded,” and 
regularly received less information and assistance than other officers, instead being “left to sink 
or swim and work[] under a continuous state of duress . . . knowing that, unlike his [w]hite 
counterparts, his employment with the Town . . . was never secured.”  (Id. ¶ 64 (quotation marks 
omitted).)  For example, some junior officers received “cheat sheets” from supervisors related to 
more difficult aspects of their jobs.  (Id. (quotation marks omitted).)  Defendants “continually 
collect[ed] . . . proof” of a “pre-established . . . belief” that Plaintiff did not belong at the Police 
Department.  (Id.)  Plaintiff alleges that despite this “hostile environment,” he remained in the 
top quarter of officers at the Police Department.  (Id.)  According to Plaintiff, “for years[,] he put 

supervisors and other officers on notice that he was being treated differently based on his race 
and ethnicity,” but nothing was done “to assist him with protecting his employment rights.”  (Id. 
¶¶ 79–80.)  He also alleges that his termination was due to “retaliation and bias based on his race 
and ethnicity.”  (Id. ¶ 78.)  Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, 
punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.  (Id. at 22–23.)         
    B.  Procedural Background                                            
    Plaintiff filed his original Complaint on January 26, 2018, at which point he was 
proceeding pro se.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  On March 19, 2018, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint.  
(Dkt. No. 20.)  On April 3, 2018, Moving Defendants filed a pre-motion letter seeking to file a 
motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint, and the Court scheduled a pre-motion conference.  
(Dkt. Nos. 22–23.)  Prior to the conference, Plaintiff filed two applications for pro bono counsel, 
which the Court denied without prejudice.  (Dkt. Nos. 27–29.)  On June 12, 2018, the Court held 
the pre-motion conference and set a briefing schedule for Moving Defendants’ Motion To 

Dismiss the Amended Complaint.  (Dkt. (minute entry for June 12, 2018).)  After receiving leave 
to file excess pages and an extension from the Court, (Dkt. Nos. 31, 36), Moving Defendants 
filed their Motion To Dismiss the Amended Complaint on August 21, 2018, (Dkt. Nos. 33–35), 
after which Plaintiff obtained counsel, (Dkt. Nos. 41–42).  Plaintiff filed a Response to the 
Motion To Dismiss the Amended Complaint on November 2, 2018, (Dkt. No. 46), after 
receiving an extension from the Court, (Dkt. No. 45).  Also after receiving an extension, (Dkt. 
No. 48), Moving Defendants filed their Reply, (Dkt. No. 49).              
    On March 29, 2019, the Court issued an Order denying Moving Defendants’ Motion To 
Dismiss the Amended Complaint without prejudice to renew, given that Plaintiff asserted in his 
Response that he had challenged his termination in an Article 78 proceeding that was pending in 

New York.  (Order 1–2 (Dkt. No. 50).)  As such, the Court directed Plaintiff to clarify which 
claims had been raised in the Article 78 proceeding.  (Id. at 2.)  The Court also noted that some 
of Plaintiff’s claims in the Amended Complaint had already been adjudicated and dismissed in 
an action before the Honorable Cathy Seibel (“Judge Seibel”) on June 25, 2015, except for 
claims related to Plaintiff’s termination.  (Id. at 1.)  Plaintiff filed his supplemental response to 
this Order on April 12, 2019, to which Moving Defendants replied on May 8, 2019.  (Dkt. Nos. 
51, 54.)  The Court held another pre-motion conference on May 15, 2019, after which Plaintiff 
filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) on June 17, 2019.  (See Dkt. (minute entry for May 
15, 2019); Second Am. Compl. (“SAC”) (Dkt. No. 57).)  On July 1, 2019, Moving Defendants 
sought to file another motion to dismiss, (Dkt. No. 58), which Plaintiff opposed, (Dkt. Nos. 60, 
62).  The Court scheduled a pre-motion conference for August 22, 2019, which was then 
rescheduled to September 10, 2019.  (Dkt. Nos. 63, 65.)  At the pre-motion conference, Plaintiff 
represented that he would file the TAC, which he did on October 9, 2019.  (See Dkt. (minute 

entry for September 10, 2019); TAC.)                                      
    On October 23, 2019, Moving Defendants once again sought to file a motion to dismiss, 
and the Court set a briefing schedule on October 30, 2019.  (Dkt. Nos. 68–69.)  After receiving 
an extension from the Court, (Dkt. No. 71), Moving Defendants filed the instant Motion on 
December 19, 2019.  (Not. of Mot.; Decl. of Vernée Pelage, Esq. in Supp. of Mot. (“Pelage 
Decl.”) (Dkt. No. 73); Moving Defs.’ Mem.)  After the Court granted his request for an 
extension, Plaintiff filed his Response on February 3, 2020.  (Pl.’s Mem. of Law in Opp’n to 
Mot. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) (Dkt. No. 77).)  Moving Defendants filed a Reply on February 18, 2020.  
(Moving Defs.’ Reply Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of Mot. (“Moving Defs.’ Reply Mem.”) 
(Dkt. No. 78).)                                                           

                          II.  Discussion                                
    A.  Standard of Review                                               
    The Supreme Court has held that although a complaint “does not need detailed factual 
allegations” to survive a motion to dismiss, “a plaintiff’s obligation to provide the grounds of his 
entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the 
elements of a cause of action will not do.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) 
(alteration and quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
“demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.”  Ashcroft 
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quotation marks omitted).  “Nor does a complaint suffice if it 
tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.”  Id. (alteration and quotation 
marks omitted).  Instead, a complaint’s “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to 
relief above the speculative level.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.           
    Although “once a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any 

set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint,” id. at 563, and a plaintiff must 
allege “only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” id. at 570, if a 
plaintiff has not “nudged [his or her] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, the[] 
complaint must be dismissed,” id.; see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (“Determining whether a 
complaint states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the 
reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.  But where the well-
pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the 
complaint has alleged—but it has not ‘show[n]’—’that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” (citation 
omitted) (second alteration in original) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2))); id. at 678–79 (“Rule 8 
marks a notable and generous departure from the hypertechnical, code-pleading regime of a prior 

era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than 
conclusions.”).                                                           
    In considering Moving Defendants’ Motion, the Court is required to “accept as true all of 
the factual allegations contained in the [TAC].”  Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007); see 
also Nielsen v. Rabin, 746 F.3d 58, 62 (2d Cir. 2014) (same).  And, the Court must “draw[] all 
reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.”  Daniel v. T & M Prot. Res., Inc., 992 F. Supp. 2d 
302, 304 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Koch v. Christie’s Intern. PLC, 699 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 
2012)).                                                                   
    B.  Analysis                                                         
    Moving Defendants argue that many of Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred, (Moving Defs.’ 
Mem. 8–9); that Plaintiff failed to include his state law claims in his notice of claim, (id. at 9–
10); that Plaintiff fails to state a prima facie claim of retaliation, (id. at 10–12); that Plaintiff’s 

claims are precluded by the findings at Plaintiff’s disciplinary hearing, (id. at 12–14); and that, to 
the extent Plaintiff intends to raise them, he has failed to state claims of discrimination and 
hostile work environment, (id. at 14–18).  Moving Defendants also argue that many of the 
individual Defendants should be dismissed, that Plaintiff fails to allege that the remaining 
individual Defendants acted with retaliatory animus, and that, in any event, the individual 
Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.  (Id. at 19–23.)  Finally, Moving Defendants argue 
that the Police Department cannot be sued, and that punitive damages are not available against a 
municipality.  (Id. at 23–24.)  The Court addresses each of these arguments to the extent 
necessary.                                                                
         1.  Statutes of Limitations                                     

              a.  Title VII                                              
    Moving Defendants argue that any claims stemming from events that occurred prior to 
300 days before Plaintiff’s October 4, 2017 EEOC filing—thus, before December 8, 2016—are 
time-barred.  (Id. at 8.)  Plaintiff does not specifically dispute this argument, instead responding 
that “though some of the claims contained in his [TAC] . . . may be time[-]barred, the [TAC] still 
contains enough allegations that are not time[-]barred that clearly establish Plaintiff’s retaliation 
claim.”  (Pl.’s Mem. 9.)                                                  
    “An aggrieved employee wishing to bring a Title VII claim in district court must file an 
administrative complaint with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged discriminatory act.”  
Petrosino v. Bell Atl., 385 F.3d 210, 219 (2d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted); see also 42 U.S.C. § 
2000e-5(e) (same); Sesay-Harrell v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Homeless Servs., No. 12-CV-925, 2013 WL 
6244158, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 2, 2013) (same).  While an exception to the statute of limitations 
exists where the plaintiff can establish a “continuing violation,” the law in the Second Circuit is 

that “multiple incidents of discrimination, even similar ones, that are not the result of a 
discriminatory policy or mechanism do not amount to a continuing violation.”  Sesay-Harrell, 
2013 WL 6244158, at *11 (emphasis, alteration, and quotation marks omitted) (quoting Hongyan 
Lu v. Chase Inv. Serv. Corp., 412 F. App’x 413, 416 (2d Cir. 2011)).  Here, Plaintiff does not 
appear to argue that a continuing violation occurred, as he does not allege the existence of a 
“discriminatory policy or mechanism,” id., but instead alleges discrete acts, such as performance 
evaluations and disciplinary actions, occurring from 2002 until his termination in 2016.  (See 
generally TAC.)  Such occurrences are typically insufficient to establish a continuing violation.  
See Moschetti v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 15-CV-3161, 2018 WL 4759787, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. 
Sept. 28, 2018) (finding that the plaintiff’s discrimination claims related to performance reviews 

and a transfer were “discrete acts that accrued on the day that the events happened” (citation and 
quotation marks omitted)), aff’d, 778 F. App’x 65 (2d Cir. 2019); Taylor v. City of New York, 
207 F. Supp. 3d 293, 307 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (“As [the plaintiff’s claims] concern discrete acts, the 
continuing violations doctrine does not apply under Title VII, § 1981, and NYSHRL.” (citing 
Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d 898, 907 (2d Cir. 1997))); Olivier v. County of 
Rockland, No. 15-CV-8337, 2017 WL 934711, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 8, 2017) (“Courts are . . . 
uniform in holding that disciplinary acts and negative evaluations . . . are ‘discrete acts of 
discrimination’ that do not suffice to invoke the continuing violation doctrine.” (citation 
omitted)).                                                                
    As such, alleged events that occurred prior to December 8, 2016—300 days before the 
filing of Plaintiff’s complaint with the EEOC—are time-barred.  However, Plaintiff “has made a 
timely allegation of an adverse employment action—[his] termination on [December 15, 2016]—
and the Court may consider [his] other allegations as ‘background evidence’ to determine 

whether that adverse action was the result of a discriminatory motive.”  Hagan v. City of New 
York, 39 F. Supp. 3d 481, 496 n.10 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citation omitted); see also Davis-Garett v. 
Urban Outfitters, Inc., 921 F.3d 30, 42 (2d Cir. 2019) (“[E]xpiration of the limitations period 
does not bar ‘an employee from using the prior acts as background evidence in support of a 
timely claim.’” (quoting Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113 (2002)); Jute 
v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 176–77 (2d Cir. 2005) (noting that “relevant 
background evidence, such as statements by a decisionmaker or earlier decisions typifying the 
retaliation involved, may be considered to assess liability on the timely alleged act” when 
retaliation allegations extend beyond the limitations period (citation omitted)); Moschetti, 2018 
WL 4759787, at *12 (finding that although several alleged events fell outside of the statute of 

limitations, those events could “still serve as background evidence of [the] [d]efendant’s 
discriminatory motives in support of timely claims” (collecting cases)).  As such, the Court will 
consider Plaintiff’s allegations outside of the limitations period as “context and support for the 
timely claims that Plaintiff asserts.”  Allen v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Envtl. Prot., 51 F. Supp. 3d 504, 
510 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citation omitted).                               
              b.  42 U.S.C. § 1981                                       
    According to Moving Defendants, Plaintiff improperly brings retaliation claims against a 
municipality and state actors under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, which should be brought under 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1983, and thus subject to a three-year statute of limitations.  (Moving Defs.’ Mem. 8.)  Moving 
Defendants therefore argue that Plaintiff’s claims pre-dating January 28, 2015 are time-barred.  
(Id.)  Plaintiff does not dispute that his claims under § 1981 should be considered under § 1983, 
or that the three-year statute of limitations under § 1983 applies, instead arguing that at least 
some of his “42 U.S.C. § 1981/83 claims” survive because “Plaintiff has been discriminated 

against so much that even [if the] Court were to ignore the horrible actions and words that were 
spoken to him in the beginning of his career, there is still more than enough discrimination to 
allow this suit to continue.”  (Pl.’s Mem. 9–10.)                         
    The Court agrees that Plaintiff’s § 1981 claims are properly construed under § 1983.  
“[Section] 1981 does not provide a separate private right of action against state actors,” and 
§ 1983 provides the “exclusive federal remedy” for such claims.  Duplan v. City of New York, 
888 F.3d 612, 619, 621 (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasis omitted); see also Gonzalez v. City of New 
York, 377 F. Supp. 3d 273, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (finding that Duplan applies not only to claims 
against the municipality itself but also against individual municipal defendants).  As such, the 
Court considers Plaintiff’s retaliation claims under § 1983.              

    Generally, employment discrimination and retaliation claims brought under § 1981 are 
subject to a four-year statute of limitations.  See Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., 541 U.S. 
369, 382 (2004); Staten v. Village of Monticello, No. 14-CV-4766, 2016 WL 7235796, at *4 n.6 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 13, 2016) (noting that “if a claim under § 1981 was made possible by the 1991 
amendments to § 1981, which extended the statute to include claims of discrimination in the 
conditions of employment, the claim is governed by the four-year statute of limitations set forth 
in 28 U.S.C. § 1658(a)” (citation and quotation marks omitted)); Vaughn v. City of New York, 
No. 06-CV-6547, 2010 WL 2076926, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 24, 2010) (“Discrimination and 
retaliation claims under § 1981 are governed by the general four year statute of limitations found 
in 28 U.S.C. § 1658.” (citation omitted)).  However, claims brought pursuant to § 1983 in New 
York are subject to a three-year statute of limitations.  See Hogan v. Fischer, 738 F.3d 509, 517 
(2d Cir. 2013) (finding that § 1983 actions filed in New York are subject to a three-year statute 
of limitations).  While some courts have applied a four-year statute of limitations to actions 

alleging violations of § 1981 by state actors through § 1983, others have applied § 1983’s three-
year statute of limitations.  See Sosa v. New York City Dep’t of Educ., 368 F. Supp. 3d 489, 509 
n.12 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (collecting cases).  Here, the Court agrees with Moving Defendants that 
“[u]ltimately, because Plaintiff[] ha[s] brought [his] [§] 1981 claims pursuant to [§] 1983, the 
claims are subject to [§] 1983’s three-year statute of limitations rather than [§] 1981’s more 
variable limitations period.”  Richardson v. City of New York, No. 17-CV-9447, 2018 WL 
4682224, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (citations omitted); see also City of Rancho Palos 
Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 124–25 (2005) (explaining that § 1983’s statute of limitations 
does not depend on which underlying right the action is brought to enforce); Duplan, 888 F.3d at 
619–21 (finding that § 1983 provides the exclusive federal remedy against state actors for 

violation of rights guaranteed by § 1981, and therefore rejecting the plaintiff’s attempts to bring a 
claim against state actors under § 1981 in order to benefit from the longer statute of limitations).  
Accordingly, all of Plaintiff’s claims of discrete acts of retaliation and discrimination brought 
pursuant to § 1983 that occurred prior to January 28, 2015 are time-barred.  However, as stated, 
to the extent these allegations provide “context and support for the timely claims that Plaintiff 
asserts,” the Court will consider them.  Allen, 51 F. Supp. 3d at 510 n.2. 
         2.  Preclusive Effect of Disciplinary Hearing                   
    Moving Defendants argue that the findings at Plaintiff’s disciplinary hearing “preclude 
Plaintiff from arguing [that] the disciplinary charges or his termination were unjustified.”  
(Moving Defs.’ Mem. 12–14.)  Plaintiff disagrees, responding that the disciplinary findings were 
unrelated to his allegations of retaliation and thus should not preclude his claims in this Action.  
(Pl.’s Mem. 12.)                                                          
    “It is well settled that federal courts must give state-court judgments the same preclusive 

effect as they would receive in courts of the same states,” Garcia v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., No. 
15-CV-767, 2018 WL 4007648, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2018) (quotation marks omitted) 
(quoting Burkybile v. Bd. of Educ. of Hastings-On-Hudson Union Free Sch. Dist., 411 F.3d 306, 
310 (2d Cir. 2005)), aff’d, 803 F. App’x 441 (2d Cir. 2020), and that state administrative 
proceedings are entitled to “preclusive effect where there has been a full and fair opportunity to 
litigate,”  Burkybile, 411 F.3d at 310.  However, although certain facts determined by the hearing 
officer may ultimately have a preclusive effect, Plaintiff is correct that the hearing officer’s legal 
conclusions in support of his termination do not preclude his claims in this Action.  See Matusick 
v. Erie Cty. Water Auth., 757 F.3d 31, 49 (2d Cir. 2014) (concluding that an administrative law 
judge’s legal conclusions did not preclude a discrimination claim because the conclusions “were 

guided by the particular legal framework and standards applicable” to the administrative 
hearings).  Specifically, it appears from Sherwood’s decision that Plaintiff did not raise 
retaliatory animus during these proceedings.  (See Pelage Decl. Ex. B (“Sherwood Decision”) 
(Dkt. No. 73-2).)  Sherwood instead recommended Plaintiff’s termination on the basis of alleged 
misconduct, and did not determine whether the disciplinary charges brought against Plaintiff 
were for a retaliatory purpose.  (Id.)  Accordingly, collateral estoppel does not apply merely 
because Sherwood decided that the Police Department had sufficient cause to fire Plaintiff.  See 
Vargas v. City of New York, 377 F.3d 200, 206 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that findings from an 
administrative hearing and an Article 78 proceeding that the plaintiff engaged in misconduct and 
should be terminated did not necessarily preclude the issue of whether the termination was made 
with discriminatory intent); Yarrington v. Candor Cent. Sch. Dist., No. 18-CV-1250, 2020 WL 
1493920, at *5–6 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2020) (finding that because a hearing officer at a Section 
75 proceeding did not consider whether the plaintiff was terminated because of retaliation or 

discrimination, the plaintiff was not precluded from bringing such claims); Tyson v. Town of 
Ramapo, No. 17-CV-4990, 2019 WL 1331913, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2019) (“Because [the] 
[p]laintiff did not raise her discrimination claims in the state proceeding, and because there is no 
other indication that the state court considered and rejected these claims, collateral estoppel does 
not preclude [the] [p]laintiff from making a discrimination challenge in the instant case.”); Senno 
v. Elmsford Union Free Sch. Dist., 812 F. Supp. 2d 454, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (“[A] finding that 
[the] [p]laintiff was terminated for cause does not bar [the] [p]laintiff’s Title VII claim.  Even if 
[the] [p]laintiff cannot dispute the factual findings of the [h]earing [o]fficer’s decision, [the] 
[p]laintiff can still prevail if he shows that [the] [d]efendants acted with an improper motive in 
bringing charges against [the] [p]laintiff.”); Morey v. Somers, No. 06-CV-1877, 2007 WL 

867203, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 2007) (finding the same when “the record of the administrative 
hearing [was] devoid of any evidence that the issue of retaliation was actually litigated and 
necessarily decided” and when “neither the hearing officer nor the Article 78 court addressed the 
issue of retaliation”); Levich v. Liberty Cent. Sch. Dist., 361 F. Supp. 2d 151, 157 n.6 (S.D.N.Y. 
2004) (“Collateral estoppel is not applicable to [the] plaintiff’s claim that the change in the 
conditions of his employment were made in retaliation for his criticism of the [s]chool [d]istrict’s 
administration[,] as that issue was not raised in the prior § 3020-a proceeding”).   
    Further, for the purposes of the present Motion, the Court declines to consider the 
transcript of the disciplinary hearing submitted by Moving Defendants.  (See Pelage Decl. Ex. C 
(“Tr. A”); id. Ex. D (“Tr. B”) (Dkt. Nos. 73-3–73-6).)  Although Plaintiff references certain 
comments made during the hearing in the TAC, (TAC ¶¶ 74, 76), “these limited references do 
not justify this Court incorporating the rest of the transcript into the [TAC].”  Agostino v. 
Simpson, No. 08-CV-5760, 2008 WL 4906140, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 17, 2008) (citation 

omitted); see also Sira v. Morton, 380 F.3d 57, 67–68 (2d Cir. 2004) (determining that the 
district court would need to convert a motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment to 
consider a hearing transcript because the complaint did not cite the transcript, it was not integral 
to the plaintiff’s claims, and the complaint included only one quotation from the transcript).  
Moreover, even if the Court did take judicial notice of this transcript, it would not consider it for 
the truth of the matters asserted therein.  See Agostino, 2008 WL 4906140, at *3 (determining 
that even when a court can take judicial notice of a testimony transcript, it may only do so on a 
motion to dismiss “to establish the existence of the [document], not for the truth of the facts 
asserted in the [document]” (alteration in original) (citations omitted)); see also Guo v. IBM 
401(k) Plus Plan, 95 F. Supp. 3d 512, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (declining to consider a transcript 

from an earlier hearing before the court because the plaintiff did not “rely on the [t]ranscript in 
crafting the [c]omplaint”).  Accordingly, the Court will not consider the hearing transcript in 
deciding the instant Motion.4                                             

    4 Similarly, the Court will not consider a March 12, 2012 e-mail filed by Moving 
Defendants with their Motion.  (Pelage Decl. Ex. A (“March 2012 E-Mail”) (Dkt. No. 73-1).)  
Moving Defendants represent that this message is referenced in the TAC and relates to the 
alleged deletion of traffic tickets issued by Plaintiff.  (Moving Defs.’ Mem. 4 & n.3.)  However, 
it is unclear from the TAC whether Plaintiff actually references this e-mail, as he states that he 
complained “in a written memo,” (TAC ¶ 60), and, in any event, Plaintiff’s limited reference to 
his message does not necessarily incorporate it into the TAC.  See Sira, 380 F.3d at 67 (“Limited 
quotation or reference to documents that may constitute relevant evidence in a case is not enough 
to incorporate those documents, wholesale, into the complaint.”).  The Court will not consider 
this document.                                                            
         3.  Retaliation Claims                                          
    Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not established that retaliation was the “but 
for” cause of his termination, and that the majority of Plaintiff’s allegations of retaliation are 
conclusory.  (Moving Defs.’ Mem. 10–12.)  Moving Defendants also argue that Plaintiff has not 

established temporal proximity between the alleged protected actions and his termination.  (Id. at 
11–12.)                                                                   
    At the outset, the Court notes that individual defendants cannot be held liable under Title 
VII.  See Davis Bell v. Columbia Univ., 851 F. Supp. 2d 650, 687 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“It is well 
settled that there is no individual liability under Title VII.” (citing Lore v. City of Syracuse, 670 
F.3d 127, 169 (2d Cir. 2012))); see also Patterson v. County of Oneida, 375 F.3d 206, 221 (2d 
Cir. 2004) (noting that “individuals are not subject to liability under Title VII,” including 
“individual defendants with supervisory control over a plaintiff” (citations and quotation marks 
omitted)).  Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff intends to bring retaliation claims against 
individual Defendants under Title VII in his TAC, these claims are dismissed with prejudice.5   

    Title VII’s anti-retaliation provision prohibits an employer from “discriminat[ing] against 
any of his employees . . . because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful 
employment practice by this subchapter.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).  In other words, “Title VII 
forbids an employer to retaliate against an employee for . . . complaining of employment 
discrimination prohibited by Title VII.”  Kessler v. Westchester Cty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 461 


    5 This is not the first time that Plaintiff has received this instruction.  In an earlier Action 
pending before Judge Seibel, Plaintiff’s Title VII claims against individual defendants were 
similarly dismissed, and although Judge Seibel noted that she “need not consider whether this 
[wa]s sanctionable conduct,” she “caution[ed] Plaintiff’s counsel not to [bring Title VII claims 
against individual defendants] again[,] or sanctions may well become an issue.”  (Decl. of Steven 
C. Stern, Esq. in Supp. of Motion To Dismiss Pl.’s Am. Compl. Ex. F (“Seibel Tr.”), at 10–11 
(Dkt. No. 34-6).)                                                         
F.3d 199, 205 (2d Cir. 2006).  Thus, “for a retaliation claim to survive . . . a motion to dismiss, 
the plaintiff must plausibly allege that: (1) defendants discriminated—or took an adverse 
employment action—against him, (2) ‘because’ he has opposed any unlawful employment 
practice.”  Vega v. Hempstead Union Free Sch. Dist., 801 F.3d 72, 90 (2d Cir. 2015) (citation 

omitted).  “A plaintiff’s burden at this prima facie stage is de minimis.”  Treglia v. Town of 
Manlius, 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. 2002) (citation and italics omitted).  Retaliation claims 
under § 1983 and the NYSHRL are subject to the same burden-shifting framework.  See 
Goonewardena v. N.Y. Workers Comp. Bd., 258 F. Supp. 3d 326, 343–44 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) 
(treating retaliation claims under Title VII, § 1983, and the NYSHRL under the same burden-
shifting framework), aff’d, 788 F. App’x 779 (2d Cir. 2019).  The Court therefore evaluates the 
substance of each of Plaintiff’s retaliation claims congruently.          
    With respect to protected activity, Plaintiff does not point to one action in particular, 
instead arguing that “[t]here is actually no one event that can be used . . . as the triggering event,” 
and that “[t]he event could as easily be a write [sic] as it could be the filing of a[n] EEOC claim 

or a refusal to sign a [HIPAA] release form.”  (Pl.’s Mem. 12.)  However, in order to state a 
claim for retaliation, Plaintiff must allege that he engaged in a “protected activity,” which “refers 
to action taken to protest or oppose statutorily prohibited discrimination.”  Soto v. Marist Coll., 
No. 17-CV-7976, 2019 WL 2371713, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2019) (citation and quotation 
marks omitted).  “The opposition must be directed at an unlawful employment practice of an 
employer,” Wimmer v. Suffolk Cty. Police Dep’t, 176 F.3d 125, 135 (2d Cir. 1999) (citation and 
quotation marks omitted), and “even an informal protest of discriminatory employment 
practices” will suffice, Mejia v. White Plains Self Storage Corp., No. 18-CV-12189, 2020 WL 
247995, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 16, 2020) (emphasis and quotation marks omitted) (quoting Sumner 
v. U.S. Postal Serv., 899 F.2d 203, 209 (2d Cir. 1990)).                  
    Here, Plaintiff alleges that he engaged in several such activities, including reporting a 
racially discriminatory comment by Corbett to his supervisor in December 2004, (TAC ¶ 39); 

filing a grievance in September 2008 related to alleged religious discrimination, (id. ¶ 55); filing 
an EEOC complaint in 2009 containing various allegations of discrimination, including Corbett’s 
comment, (id. ¶ 56); and filing another EEOC complaint in 2017 related to his termination, (id. 
¶ 25).  Thus, the Court construes the TAC as alleging that the 2004 and 2008 reports, along with 
the 2009 EEOC Complaint, are the activities for which Defendants retaliated against Plaintiff.6  
Other, more general allegations raised by Plaintiff that “for years[,] he put supervisors and other 
officers on notice that he was being treated differently based on his race and ethnicity,” (id. 


    6 Although Plaintiff alleges that he made other reports of misconduct, such as being 
“berated” for issuing a routine ticket to Franklin’s friend, (TAC ¶ 49), and “complain[ing]” about 
his “heavy workload” in 2007, (id. ¶ 51), Plaintiff does not indicate that these objections were 
related to “statutorily prohibited discrimination,” and, as such, they do not constitute protected 
activities for the purpose of Plaintiff’s retaliation claims.  See Mejia, 2020 WL 247995, at *6 
(dismissing a retaliation claim when the plaintiff alleged that he complained when the defendant 
was not honoring his request not to work on Sundays, but did not allege that he mentioned to his 
supervisors that his religion required him to take the day off); Aspilaire v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., 
612 F. Supp. 2d 289, 308–09 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“[M]ere complaints of unfair treatment by an 
individual are not protected speech because unfair treatment by an employer does not implicate a 
public interest concern.” (citation omitted)).  Further, with respect to HIPAA releases given to 
Plaintiff, nowhere in the TAC does Plaintiff allege that he refused to sign these forms.  Instead, 
he alleges that on December 1, 2015, he “accept[ed] the written order” to sign a HIPAA form, 
which “implie[d] the willingness to comply with it,” and on December 16, 2015, he signed a 
HIPAA release form, (TAC ¶¶ 67, 69).                                      
    Moreover, the Court cannot consider the 2017 EEOC complaint as a protected activity for 
the purpose of Plaintiff’s retaliation claims because Plaintiff’s termination took place before this 
complaint was filed.  See Slattery v. Swiss Reins. Am. Corp., 248 F.3d 87, 95 (2d. Cir. 2001) 
(“Where timing is the only basis for a claim of retaliation, and gradual adverse job actions began 
well before the [p]laintiff had ever engaged in any protected activity, an inference of retaliation 
does not arise.”).                                                        
¶ 79), are conclusory, and without further details, the Court will not consider them.  See Henry v. 
N.Y.C. Health & Hosp. Corp., 18 F. Supp. 3d 396, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (dismissing a retaliation 
claim where the complaint “fails to state with even a modicum of specificity when the relevant 
events occurred”).  Similarly, although Plaintiff does not specifically name an action by 

Defendants as the “adverse action” upon which he bases his retaliation claims, in his Opposition, 
Plaintiff states that the adverse employment action he focuses on is his termination.  (Pl.’s Mem. 
14.)7                                                                     
    With respect to the causation element for a claim of retaliation, “a plaintiff must plausibly 
plead a connection between the act and his engagement in protected activity.”  Vega, 801 F.3d at 


    7 Plaintiff previously brought a case before Judge Seibel related to his attempt to observe 
a religious holiday, claiming, as he has here, that a white female police officer was allowed to 
operate on a modified work schedule to accommodate her religious beliefs, but that Plaintiff was 
written up for doing so.  (See Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 11, Tenemille v. Ramapo Police 
Department, Case No. 14-CV-4660).)  Judge Seibel construed Plaintiff’s protected activity to be 
the filing of his 2009 EEOC complaint and the alleged adverse actions to be either the adoption 
of a religious leave policy or Plaintiff’s suspension from March 2012 to February 2013, neither 
of which Plaintiff mentions in the TAC.  (Seibel Tr. 8–9.)  Judge Seibel ruled that the adoption 
of the religious leave policy was time-barred, the three-year gap between the 2009 EEOC 
complaint and Plaintiff’s 2012 suspension was too lengthy to raise an inference of causation, and 
Plaintiff failed to allege that any comparators were similarly situated.  (Id. at 11–12.)  Judge 
Seibel ultimately granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the case.  (Dkt. No. 
25, Tenemille v. Ramapo Police Department, Case No. 14-CV-4660.)          
    Conversely, here, Plaintiff appears to allege that the adverse action was his 2016 
termination, and the issues with his desired religious observance were part of a pattern of 
retaliation leading up to his termination.  (See Pl.’s Mem. 14 (“[Plaintiff] suffered an adverse 
employment action (he was fired) . . . . [a]nd . . . the discrimination never stopped until he was 
terminated.”).)  Further, when Plaintiff filed the action before Judge Seibel, he had not yet been 
terminated.  As such, because Plaintiff’s claim is not identical to that brought before Judge 
Seibel, and because Plaintiff’s termination could not have been litigated at that point, the Court 
does consider Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the 2008 grievance and 2009 EEOC complaint.  
See Leather v. Eyck, 180 F.3d 420, 424 (2d Cir. 1999) (“Under the doctrine of claim preclusion, 
a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating 
issues that were or could have been raised in that action.” (quotation marks omitted)).  However, 
the Court finds Judge Seibel’s previous determination to be highly relevant in deciding this 
Motion.                                                                   
90.  A plaintiff can demonstrate the causal connection in one of two ways: “(1) indirectly, by 
showing that the protected activity was followed closely by discriminatory treatment, or through 
other circumstantial evidence such as disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in 
similar conduct; or (2) directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the 

plaintiff by the defendant.”  Gordon v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 232 F.3d 111, 117 (2d Cir. 2000); 
see also Rodriguez v. Town of Ramapo, 412 F. Supp. 3d 412, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (same).  Here, 
Plaintiff does not specifically “tie [his termination] to the reporting of any act of discrimination.”  
Grimes-Jenkins v. Consol. Edison Co. of New York, Inc., No. 16-CV-4897, 2017 WL 2258374, 
at *11 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2017), adopted by 2017 WL 2709747 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2017).  
Instead, Plaintiff alleges only that “[w]hen [Plaintiff] complained of the discriminatory and 
harassing conduct committed against him by his supervisors and co-workers, the . . . Police 
Department retaliated against him by bringing unfounded disciplinary charges and terminating 
his employment.”  (TAC ¶ 33.)  However, Plaintiff does not allege any facts to plausibly suggest 
that his aforementioned protected activities motivated this termination, such as “negative 

comments by supervisors” about his complaints, Gelin v. Geithner, No. 06-CV-10176, 2009 WL 
804144, at *22 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2009), aff’d, 376 F. App’x 127 (2d Cir. 2010), or “an 
admission by the decisionmaker that he . . . made a decision by relying on an improper 
consideration,” Farmer v. Shake Shack Enters., LLC, No. 19-CV-9425, 2020 WL 4194860, at 
*13 (S.D.N.Y. July 21, 2020) (citation and quotation marks omitted).  (See generally TAC.)  The 
Court therefore considers whether Plaintiff has indirectly alleged a causal connection.  
    Moving Defendants argue, inter alia, that the alleged protected activities and adverse 
event did not occur close enough in time to raise an inference of retaliation.  (Moving Defs.’ 
Mem. 11–12.)  Although the Second Circuit “ha[s] not drawn a bright line to define the outer 
limits beyond which a temporal relationship is too attenuated to establish a causal relationship 
between [a protected activity] and an allegedly retaliatory activity,” Summa v. Hofstra Univ., 708 
F.3d 115, 128 (2d Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted), the temporal proximity must be “very 
close,” and a lapse of as much as “20 months . . . suggests, by itself, no causality at all,” Clark 

Cty. Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, 532 U.S. 268, 273–74 (2001) (quotation marks omitted); see also 
Harper v. Brooklyn Children’s Ctr., No. 12-CV-4545, 2014 WL 1154056, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 
20, 2014) (“[T]he approximately two years between [the] plaintiff’s 2007 federal action and [the] 
defendant’s alleged retaliation in 2009 do not support an inference of retaliation because they 
lack temporal proximity.” (quotation marks omitted)).  As such, when considering temporal 
proximity alone, Plaintiff’s 2016 termination is beyond the “outer limit of the amount of time 
that is considered sufficient to establish causation.”  Cronin v. St. Lawrence, No. 08-CV-6346, 
2009 WL 2391861, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2009) (finding that the passage of eleven months 
was at this “outer limit”) (citations omitted); see also Bucalo v. Shelter Island Union Free Sch. 
Dist., 691 F.3d 119, 131 (2d Cir. 2012) (noting that courts “typically measure[] th[e] gap 

[between a protected activity and alleged retaliation] as a matter of months, not years” (citation 
omitted)); Saenger v. Monte, 706 F. Supp. 2d 494, 520 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding that the passage 
of a year between the plaintiff’s age discrimination complaint and his termination was “outside 
the normal zone of tolerable temporal proximity” (collecting cases)); Tori v. Marist Coll., No. 
06-CV-419, 2008 WL 11451434, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2008) (granting a motion for 
summary judgment when the gap between the protected activity and denial of tenure was more 
than five years); Nicastro v. Runyon, 60 F. Supp. 2d 181, 185 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (“Claims of 
retaliation are routinely dismissed when as few as three months elapse between the protected . . . 
activity and the alleged act of retaliation.  Surely, two-and-one half years is far too long to 
warrant an inference of discriminatory retaliation.” (citations omitted)).   
    Additionally, at least one of Plaintiff’s allegations of antagonism—the questioning of his 
service in the Navy—took place at least two years before Plaintiff’s report of Corbett’s 

statement, his first protected act, and many more of the alleged incidents took place in the years 
leading up to his October 2008 grievance and 2009 EEOC complaint.  (See TAC ¶¶ 34–36 
(incident related to investigation of Plaintiff’s Naval service), 40–54 (events prior to Plaintiff’s 
2008 grievance and 2009 EEOC complaint).)  As such, “the requisite causal connection . . . 
falter[s]” because the “complained-of conduct began before [Plaintiff’s] corresponding protected 
activity.”  Wang v. Palmisano, 157 F. Supp. 3d 306, 327 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (collecting cases); see 
also Dabney v. Christmas Tree Shops, 958 F. Supp. 2d 439, 456 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“Although 
temporal proximity can sometimes demonstrate a causal nexus, where . . . the termination was 
ultimately the product of an extensive period of progressive discipline that began when [the] 
[p]laintiff received h[is] first written warning . . . months before [the employer learned of the 

alleged protected activity], a claim for retaliation cannot be maintained.”  (quotation marks 
omitted)), aff’d sub nom. Dabney v. Bed Bath & Beyond, 588 F. App’x 15 (2d Cir. 2014); White 
v. Eastman Kodak, No. 06-CV-6493, 2009 WL 1514659, at *10 (W.D.N.Y. May 29, 2009) 
(“[W]here . . . discipline was already underway prior to the protected activity . . . , the Second 
Circuit has held that temporal proximity alone is insufficient to make out a prima facie case.”), 
aff’d, 368 F. App’x 200 (2d Cir. 2010).                                   
    However, Plaintiff argues that he relies not only on temporal proximity, but also on the 
fact that “the civil rights violations never stopped” until his termination.  (Pl.’s Mem. 12, 14.)  
Plaintiff thus appears to allege that his termination occurred “against a backdrop of continuing 
antagonism and frustration of [Plaintiff’s] professional ambitions,” which, in some cases, can 
“establish a drumbeat of retaliatory animus from which a plausible inference of causation can be 
drawn.”  Duplan, 888 F.3d at 626.  Indeed, “[t]emporal gaps that are too long to give rise to an 
inference of causation may be bridged by an intervening pattern of retaliatory treatment.”  

Burgos v. City of New York, No. 18-CV-1150, 2019 WL 1299461, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 21, 
2019) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Chan v. NYU Downtown Hosp., No. 03-
CV-3003, 2004 WL 213024, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 2004) (“Even though an alleged act of 
retaliation may be separated by a significant gap in time from the date on which a complaint of 
discrimination was made, evidence of an intervening pattern of antagonism . . . could support an 
inference that an alleged retaliatory act . . . was causally related to [a] complaint of 
discrimination.” (citation omitted)).  Where such a pattern exists, “the court will find but-for 
causation even if there might be another motivating factor.”  Butts v. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 
16-CV-5504, 2018 WL 4725263, at *13 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 28, 2018) (citation omitted). 
    The Court finds that Plaintiff has not pled facts that plausibly establish a “backdrop of 

continuing antagonism,” Duplan, 888 F.3d at 626, that would support an inference of causation.  
First, Plaintiff fails to provide specific dates for many of the events detailed in the TAC.  For 
example, he alleges that in December 2004, Corbett stated that “they [African-Americans] only 
have [two-fifths] of a brain anyway,” which Plaintiff reported to his supervisor.  (TAC ¶ 38 (first 
alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted).)  Plaintiff thereafter claims that actions were 
taken against him for his handwriting, he was “constantly under-evaluated,” and his “positive 
accomplishments” were ignored in a “concerted effort to bolster the . . . Police Department’s aim 
of terminating him.”  (Id. ¶¶ 40–44.)  However, Plaintiff either makes vague statements about 
when these events occurred, (id. ¶ 42 (“Not long after the report incident with . . . Corbett . . .”)), 
or does not clarify whether the events occurred before or after he reported Corbett’s statement, 
(id. ¶ 46 (alleging that “in 2004,” he was recommended for termination and was given an 
unsatisfactory evaluation)), making it impossible for the Court to determine whether a “pattern of 
retaliatory conduct beg[a]n[] soon after the protected conduct,” Krause v. Eihab Human Servs., 

Inc., No. 10-CV-898, 2015 WL 4645210, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2015) (emphasis added) 
(citation, alterations, and quotation marks omitted)).  A series of Plaintiff’s later allegations are 
similarly unclear as to the timeline, and are thus “too vague in nature and non-specific as to time 
to serve as a basis”  for Plaintiff’s retaliation claims.  Winston v. City of New York, No. 12-CV-
395, 2013 WL 4516097, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 23, 2013).  (See TAC ¶ 52 (noting that Plaintiff 
was “later transferred to another sector”), ¶ 62 (stating that an incident generally “generated a 
wave of discriminatory and retaliatory backlash”), ¶ 64 (claiming that “[Plaintiff] was 
continually reprimanded”).)  See also Ward v. Shaddock, No. 14-CV-7660, 2016 WL 4371752, 
at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 11, 2016) (finding that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for retaliation 
when the plaintiff made “generalized reference” to the dates of relevant events); Wang, 51 F. 

Supp. 3d at 541 (dismissing retaliation claim where the plaintiff “alleged the dates on which he 
filed his complaints” but “merely allege[d]” that the retaliation occurred “‘after’ he filed his 
complaints” (record citation omitted)); Henry, 18 F. Supp. 3d at 412–13 (dismissing retaliation 
claims when the plaintiff “fail[ed] to state with even a modicum of specificity when the relevant 
events occurred”).                                                        
    Second, many of the events alleged by Plaintiff do not appear to rise to the level of 
adverse actions.  Although Plaintiff does claim that he received one “unsatisfactory” evaluation 
in 2004, (TAC ¶ 46), and “low marks” on a later evaluation, (id. ¶ 54), he also alleges that in 
2014, he was rated as “[a]verage” for the year, even though he had achieved the fourth largest 
number of arrests, stopped a suicide, and was recommended for an award that he did not receive, 
(id. ¶ 63).  While negative performance evaluations can constitute adverse employment actions, 
see, e.g., Vega, 801 F.3d at 91–92, a positive, or “less-than-perfect” review, such as an “average” 
rating, is distinguishable, Pistello v. Bd. of Educ. of Canastota Cent. Sch. Dist., No. 16-CV-212, 

2019 WL 1300947, at *14 (Mar. 21, 2019) (collecting cases), overturned on other grounds, 808 
F. App’x 19 (2d Cir. 2020); see also Moy v. Perez, 712 F. App’x 38, 41 (2d Cir. 2017) (holding 
that a positive performance evaluation, even if less positive than those received in previous 
years, cannot “plausibly make out an adverse employment action” in the retaliation context); 
Byrne v. Telesector Res. Grp., Inc., 339 F. App’x 13, 17 (2d Cir. 2009) (determining that because 
a satisfactory performance evaluation was still positive, it was not an adverse employment action 
in the context of Title VII retaliation claims).                          
    Similarly, with respect to Plaintiff’s sick leaves, at least one of his allegations seems to 
suggest only that a leave was more closely scrutinized, which also does not constitute an adverse 
event.  (Id. ¶¶ 69, 72 (noting that Plaintiff was directed to sign a “HIPAA release form” after 

Defendants attempted to examine his “medical dossier” to substantiate doctor’s notes submitted 
by Plaintiff after taking a sick day, and that he was “interrogated” regarding events dating back 
to 2004).)  See Cody v. County of Nassau, 577 F. Supp. 2d 623, 645–46 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) 
(finding that requiring the plaintiff to provide documentation from a physician whenever she 
used a sick day and allegedly falsely accusing the plaintiff of being absent without authorization 
were not adverse actions), aff’d, 345 F. App’x 717 (2d Cir. 2009); Lee v. Verizon Wireless, Inc., 
No. 07-CV-532, 2008 WL 4479410, at *7 (D. Conn. Sept. 26, 2008) (“[Q]uestioning by 
supervisors . . . and oral or written warnings based on documented company policy violations are 
not materially adverse actions in the view of a reasonable employee and constitute, at best, trivial 
harms which are not actionable.” (quotation marks omitted)); Blake v. Potter, No. 03-CV-7733, 
2007 WL 2815637, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2007) (finding that “being asked to bring in a 
doctor’s note to substantiate a request for sick leave . . . or being given a . . . letter of warning for 
failure to do so” did not constitute adverse employment action).   Plaintiff also details several 

instances where he was unfairly “berated” or “reprimanded” by other officers, which similarly 
would not constitute an adverse action to the extent that there were not other negative results, 
such as a demotion or decrease in pay.  (TAC ¶¶ 49, 64.)  See Lucenti v. Potter, 432 F. Supp. 2d 
347, 364 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“Reprimands, threats of disciplinary action, and excessive scrutiny do 
not constitute adverse employment actions.”); Nix v. Cino, No. 02-CV-4609, 2006 WL 2711625, 
at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2006) (“Mere reprimands or threats of disciplinary action, absent any 
other negative results, such as a decrease in pay, do not qualify as adverse employment 
actions.”).  Plaintiff also fails to allege that the officers involved in these issues were aware of or 
involved in handling his alleged protected reports.  (See generally TAC ¶¶ 39 (stating that 
Plaintiff “complained of [discriminatory comments] to his supervisors”), 55 (noting that Plaintiff 

filed a grievance, without further details on the handling of this grievance), 56 (stating that in 
2009, Plaintiff filed an EEOC report).)                                   
    Plaintiff further admits that some of the instances of alleged retaliatory conduct detailed 
in his TAC were resolved.  For example, Plaintiff alleges that in May 2010, when he filed a 
police report about his au pair taking his keys, the issue was improperly investigated until he 
complained to his supervisor.  (TAC ¶ 58; see also id. ¶ 63 (explaining that Plaintiff’s 2014 
evaluation did not mention his halting of a suicide attempt “until after [Plaintiff] protested”).)  
The Court is therefore not persuaded that such instances help to establish a pattern of continuous 
antagonism.  Finally, Plaintiff’s allegations that he was “subjected to a constant bombardment of 
discrimination and harassment because of his race/color, national origin, and religion,” (id. ¶ 36), 
and that after putting a bumper sticker in support of Obama on his car, he suffered “a wave of 
discriminatory and retaliatory backlash,” (id. ¶ 66), without more, are conclusory and do not 
establish an inference of causation.                                      

    Most glaringly, even if the Court were to consider all of the events alleged by Plaintiff 
from the time of his first complaint in 2004 to his termination in 2016, the length of time 
between these alleged acts is too protracted to plausibly suggest that a “backdrop of continuing 
antagonism” existed.  Duplan, 888 F.3d at 626.  Plaintiff alleges a series of actions by members 
of the Police Department over the course of 14 years, stretching from 2002 until his termination 
in 2016.  (See generally TAC.)  In many cases, one, or fewer than one, of these acts occurred 
each year.  (See id. ¶¶ 37–75 (alleging multiple events in 2004, one event in each of 2005 and 
2006, two events in 2007, one event in 2008, two events in 2010, one event in each of 2012, 
2013, and 2014, and several events in 2015 and 2016 leading up to Plaintiff’s termination).)  The 
alleged acts are sporadic at best, and do not demonstrate “an[] ongoing pattern of adverse actions 

that might link the [protected complaints] to [Plaintiff’s 2016 termination].”  Malgeri v. 
Ehrenberg, No. 12-CV-2517, 2012 WL 6647515, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2012).  Indeed, the 
Second Circuit and district courts within it have found such a pattern to exist when alleged acts 
of antagonism occur with more regularity and often over a shorter period of time.  See Duplan, 
888 F.3d at 626 (finding that following complaints of discrimination by plaintiff in 2011, “his 
supervisors collectively and persistently discouraged him from remaining at the [workplace] by 
ostracizing him, giving him insufficient work, and making clear to him that his career would not 
advance further by denying him every promotion and raise” over the course of three years); Jute, 
420 F.3d at 170 (finding that the plaintiff suffered “numerous other retaliatory acts” over the 
course of two years, in the lead up to his termination); Chabot v. County of Rockland, No. 18-
CV-4109, 2019 WL 3338319, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2019) (concluding that the plaintiff 
alleged a course of antagonistic conduct over the course of 17 months when he pointed to 
criticisms regularly made about his protected speech and activities and threatening his 

employment); Burgos, 2019 WL 1299461, at *10 (determining that the plaintiff sufficiently pled 
the existence of a pattern of antagonism when he engaged in four instances of protected activity 
over the course of two years and, over the same period, received eight disciplinary complaints, 
two unsatisfactory performance reviews, denial of a promotion, and multiple disciplinary 
complaints); Goode v. Donahue, No. 12-CV-3982, 2015 WL 6680227, at *2, *5–*6 (E.D.N.Y. 
Nov. 2, 2015) (noting that between a 2006 complaint and a 2009 termination, the plaintiff was 
followed on her work route every day to “lay the foundation for her termination,” endured 
comments about her race every other day, and received seven disciplinary notices and 
suspensions over the course of two years); Stokes v. City of Mount Vernon, No. 11-CV-7675, 
2012 WL 3536461, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2012) (finding that plaintiff’s allegations 

adequately supported an inference of a causal connection between the plaintiff’s protected 
speech and his constructive discharge when the defendants allegedly engaged in acts of a 
“continuing nature . . . , commencing shortly after plaintiff’s [protected act]”).  Nor has Plaintiff 
suggested that his termination in 2016 was Defendants’ first opportunity to take adverse action 
against him, or that Defendants explicitly indicated to him that his protected speech could affect 
him in the future.  Cf. Mandell v. County of Suffolk, 316 F.3d 368, 384 (2d Cir. 2003) (finding 
that a protracted period of time between the protected speech and the adverse action did not 
preclude an inference of causation when the plaintiff’s supervisor allegedly warned him of 
“baggage” from his protected speech); Bucalo, 691 F.3d at 131 (noting that a retaliation claim 
was submitted to the jury even when there was a four-year gap between the protected activity 
and the adverse event because the defendant took adverse action “on its first opportunity to do 
so”).  Further, although Plaintiff alleges a more regularly established pattern of antagonistic acts 
in 2015 and 2016, (TAC ¶¶ 65–75), he does not allege that he performed any protected act close 

to that time frame, other than filing the EEOC complaint six to seven years earlier, (see generally 
id. ¶¶ 56–75).                                                            
    Plaintiff also alleges throughout the TAC that he was treated differently in comparison to 
white officers at the Police Department.  Specifically, Plaintiff claims that he received “lower 
marks” than “a majority of [w]hite officers whose productivity w[as] inferior to his,” (id. ¶ 43); 
other officers received positive recognition and awards in their evaluations, while Plaintiff did 
not, (id. ¶ 44); mistakes made by Plaintiff were highlighted, whereas other officers received only 
warnings for similar mistakes, (id.); when a white officer took over “Sector 2,” where Plaintiff 
had previously been stationed and complained about the workload, it was determined that there 
was too much work for one officer and the section was split into two, whereas Plaintiff had been 

reprimanded for making the same suggestion, (id. ¶ 51–52); Plaintiff was written up for misuse 
of a personal day that he took for a religious observance, which a white female officer had 
similarly done three months earlier, (id. ¶ 55); junior white officers received “cheat sheets,” 
whereas Plaintiff was left to “sink or swim,” (id. ¶ 64 (quotation marks omitted)); no other 
officers were required to sign a HIPAA release to substantiate a sick day, (id. ¶ 68); and no other 
officers have been subject to termination based on the belief that the officer would likely not 
follow an instruction, such as signing a HIPAA form, (id.).               
    “[W]here a plaintiff seeks to make out [a] prima facie case by pointing to the disparate 
treatment of a purportedly similarly situated employee, the plaintiff must show that [he] shared 
sufficient employment characteristics with that conspirator so that they could be similarly 
situated.”  McGuinness v. Lincoln Hall, 263 F.3d 49, 53 (2d Cir. 2001).  “An employee is 
similarly situated to co-employees if they were (1) subject to the same performance evaluation 
and discipline standards and (2) engaged in comparable conduct.”  Ruiz v. County of Rockland, 

609 F.3d 486, 493–94 (2d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); see also Henry, 18 F. Supp. 3d at 408 
(noting that to establish a claim for disparate treatment, a comparator must be “similarly situated 
[to a plaintiff] in all material respects”).  “Even on a motion to dismiss, a court must determine 
whether, based on a plaintiff’s allegations in the complaint, it is plausible that a jury could 
ultimately determine that the comparators are similarly situated.”  Buttaro v. City of New York, 
No. 15-CV-5703, 2017 WL 1906725, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. May 8, 2017) (citation and quotation 
marks omitted).                                                           
    Here, Plaintiff has not successfully alleged that he and the white officers he mentions in 
the TAC were similarly situated.  Instead, “[h]e pleaded only one commonality between himself 
and the other [individuals]: they were [police officers].”  Van Allen v. N.Y.C. Sch. Constr. Auth., 

No. 17-CV-2176, 2018 WL 4783966, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2018) (record citation omitted).  
He has not, for example, indicated whether these officers were in the same role and subject to the 
same performance evaluations and discipline standards as Plaintiff, and for some of the 
comparators, he has not established that they engaged in comparable conduct.  (See TAC ¶¶ 43 
(“[Plaintiff] received lower marks in many instances than a majority of [w]hite officers whose 
productivity was inferior to his.”), 44 (indicating that Plaintiff’s “positive accomplishments” 
were ignored, while “many other officers received awards for” similar accomplishments and that 
Plaintiff’s mistakes were highlighted, for which “most [w]hite officers at worst received 
warnings”), 52 (“[A] white officer took over [S]ector [Two][,] and the [S]ector was determined 
to be too much for one officer . . . .”), 55 (“Three months prior to [Plaintiff seeking a modified 
schedule for a religious observance,] it had been done by a white female officer.”),  64 
(“Supervisors often provided guides or ‘cheat sheets’ to junior officers . . . .”).)  Further, in 
several instances, Plaintiff does not refer to a comparator at all, making only sweeping, 

conclusory statements.  (Id. ¶ 68 (“Never has any other officer in the Town . . . had to sign a 
HIPAA release under the same circumstances [Plaintiff] faced . . . and never[] has any other 
officer been subjected to a severely adverse disciplinary action . . . based solely on a supervisor’s 
highly prejudicial ‘belief’ that the officer would likely not follow a given order.”).)  As Judge 
Seibel determined in Plaintiff’s previous case, Plaintiff has provided insufficient facts from 
which the Court could draw an inference of disparate treatment, and, as a result, “[i]t may not be 
reasonably inferred from the factual allegations in the [TAC] that any non-African-American or 
non-Haitian employee similarly situated to [P]laintiff in all material respects was subject to 
differential treatment by . . . [D]efendants.”  (Seibel Tr. 12 (citation and quotation marks 
omitted).)                                                                

    As such, the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s retaliation claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. 
§ 1983.  Given that this is the first adjudication of Plaintiff’s claims on the merits, this dismissal 
is without prejudice.                                                     
         4.  Discrimination and Hostile Work Environment                 
    According to Moving Defendants, counsel for Plaintiff represented at a May 15, 2019 
pre-motion conference before the Court that Plaintiff would withdraw his discrimination claims.  
(Moving Defs.’ Reply Mem. 4.)  Plaintiff thereafter removed these claims from the causes of 
action listed in his SAC and in the TAC.  (Id.; compare SAC, TAC with Compl. ¶¶ 75–79, 84–
88, 93–96 (including discrimination and harassment as causes of action).)8  For example, the 
TAC lists three causes of action—retaliation in violation of § 1981, Title VII, and the 
NYSHRL—and no causes of action for discrimination or hostile work environment.  (TAC ¶¶ 
82–92.)  Additionally, although Plaintiff argues in his Opposition that he does state claims for 

discrimination and hostile work environment, he also represents that “[t]his suit is a claim about 
retaliation . . . [t]hat came from [Plaintiff’s] termination.”  (Pl.’s Mem. 12.)  Because Plaintiff is 
counseled, he “is not entitled to any of the latitude afforded to pro se litigants in adjudicating a 
motion to dismiss,” Harty v. Nyack Motor Hotel Inc., No. 19-CV-1322, 2020 WL 1140783, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2020) (citations omitted), and the Court need not construe the TAC liberally.  
Further, counseled plaintiffs may generally not “use their opposition to [a] motion to dismiss to 
raise new claims or arguments.”  Chamberlain v. City of White Plains, 986 F. Supp. 2d 363, 390 
n.19 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citation, alterations, and quotation marks omitted); Kiryas Joel All. v. 
Village of Kiryas Joel, No. 11-CV-3982, 2011 WL 5995075, at *10 n.9 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, 
20211) (same), aff’d 495 F. App’x 183 (2d Cir. 2012).  To the extent Plaintiff seeks to bring 

discrimination and hostile work environment claims in addition to his retaliation claims, Plaintiff 
must clarify that he intends to do so in an amended complaint.            
         5.  Police Department                                           
    Plaintiff sues the Police Department, but Moving Defendants argue, (Moving Defs.’ 
Mem. 23), “under New York law, departments which are merely administrative arms of a 
municipality[] do not have a legal identity separate apart from the municipality and cannot sue or 
be sued.”  Elek v. Incorporated Village of Monroe, 815 F. Supp. 2d 801, 806 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 


    8 No court reporter served during this conference.  (See Dkt. (minute entry for May 15, 
2019).)  As such, a transcript is not available.                          
2011) (citation, alterations, and quotation marks omitted).  “[A] police department[] [is] just such 
an administrative arm[] of [its] corresponding municipality, and therefore cannot sue or be sued.”  
Howell v. Port Chester Police Station, No. 09-CV-1651, 2010 WL 930981, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 
15, 2010) (citation omitted).  Where both the municipality and the municipal agency have been 

named as defendants, courts have dismissed the claims against the agency.  See Hall v. City of 
White Plains, 185 F. Supp. 2d 293, 303 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (“Because [the] plaintiff has named the 
City of White Plains as a defendant, any claims against the [White Plains Department of Public 
Safety (“WPDPS”)] are redundant.  WPDPS does not have its own legal identity, and therefore 
the claims against it are dismissed.”); Manning v. County of Westchester, No. 93-CV-3366, 1995 
WL 12579, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 1995) (removing the Westchester County Police Department 
as a named defendant where the County of Westchester, as the real party in interest, was already 
a named defendant).9  Accordingly, all of Plaintiff’s claims against the Police Department are 
also dismissed with prejudice.10                                          




    9 Plaintiff also fails to respond to this argument in his Memorandum, thus waiving any 
objection to it.  (See generally Pl.’s Mem.)  “At the motion to dismiss stage, where review is 
limited to the pleadings, a plaintiff abandons a claim by failing to address the defendant’s 
arguments in support of dismissing that claim.”  Romeo & Juliette Laser Hair Removal, Inc. v. 
Assara I LLC, No. 08-CV-442, 2014 WL 4723299, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2014) (citation 
omitted).                                                                 

    10 Moving Defendants also raise a number of arguments related to the individual 
Defendants, arguing that the majority of individual Defendants were not involved in Plaintiff’s 
termination, that Plaintiff has insufficiently alleged that Weidel, Hyman, and Matos acted with 
retaliatory animus, and that the individual Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.  
(Moving Defs.’ Mem. 19–23.)  Because the Court has dismissed Plaintiff’s retaliation claims on 
the merits, the Court does not address these arguments herein.  If Plaintiff seeks to file a fourth 
amended complaint, Plaintiff may seek to cure any of these alleged deficiencies.  
         6.  Punitive Damages                                            
    Defendants move to dismiss any claims for punitive damages against the Town and 
individual Defendants sued in their official capacities.  (See Defs.’ Mem. 23–24.)  Plaintiff does 
not dispute this portion of Moving Defendants’ Motion, (see generally Pl.’s Mem.), and the law 

is clear that municipal defendants may not be held liable for punitive damages, see Cross v. 
N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 417 F.3d 241, 254, 256–57 (2d Cir. 2005) (acknowledging the general rule 
that “no punitive damages are allowed [against municipalities] unless expressly authorized by 
statute”); Ivani Contracting Corp. v. New York City, 103 F.3d 257, 262 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding 
that an officer sued in his official capacity enjoys the same immunities from punitive damages as 
the city).  Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiff seeks punitive damages against the Town of 
Ramapo and individual Defendants in their official capacities, those claims must be dismissed. 
         7.  State Law Claims                                            
    Moving Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s NYSHRL claims are barred because Plaintiff 
failed to include them in a notice of claim, and that many of these claims are time-barred.  

(Moving Defs.’ Mem. 8–10.)  However, because the Court has dismissed the TAC, the Court 
declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims at this juncture.  
See Marcus v. AT&T Corp., 138 F.3d 46, 57 (2d Cir. 1998) (“In general, where the federal 
claims are dismissed before trial, the state claims should be dismissed as well.” (citations 
omitted)); Thomas v. Grunberg 77 LLC, No. 15-CV-1925, 2017 WL 3263141, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 
July 28, 2017) (dismissing state claims where the federal claims had been mooted); Torres v. 
City of New York, 248 F. Supp. 2d 333, 334 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“Where the basis for pendent 
jurisdiction is dismissed, ordinarily so should the state law claims be dismissed.” (citations 
omitted)).  To the extent that Plaintiff seeks to file a fourth amended complaint, Plaintiff may 
reassert his claims under state law and cure any potential deficiencies raised by Defendants in 
their Motion.                                                             
                          III.Conclusion                                 
    For the foregoing reasons, Moving Defendants’ Motion To Dismiss is granted.  Because 

this is the first adjudication on the merits of Plaintiff’s claims, the dismissal is without prejudice, 
with the exception of Plaintiff’s Title VII claims against the individual Defendants, all claims 
against the Ramapo Police Department, and any claims for punitive damages against the Town 
or individual Defendants in their official capacities, which are dismissed with prejudice.  If 
Plaintiff wishes to file a fourth amended complaint addressing the deficiencies discussed in this 
Opinion & Order, or any other deficiencies raised in Defendants’ Motion, Plaintiff must do so 
within 30 days of the date of this Opinion & Order.  Plaintiff is advised that the fourth amended 
complaint will replace, not supplement, all prior complaints.  The fourth amended complaint 
must contain all of the claims, factual allegations, and exhibits that Plaintiff wishes the Court to 
consider.  If Plaintiff fails to abide by the 30-day deadline, the Action may be dismissed with 

prejudice.                                                                
    The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the pending Motion, (Dkt. No. 72). 
SO ORDERED.
