outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== SBC Tower Holdings LLC''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in remanding the case to state court because the Rhode Island statute (R.I. Gen. Laws § 8-8-3(a)(2)) allocating exclusive jurisdiction over landlord-tenant disputes to state district courts does not preclude removal to federal court where diversity jurisdiction exists.

  2. Appellant contended that the choice-of-law provision in the lease agreement did not constitute an exclusive forum-selection clause requiring litigation exclusively in Rhode Island district court.'
