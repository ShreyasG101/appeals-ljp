outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Spencer Jackson and Sean Roycroft''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in denying them qualified immunity because there was no clearly established law prohibiting the use of force prior to Miller being handcuffed, specifically contending that the relevant precedent (McCue v. City of Bangor and Abdullahi v. City of Madison) only applied to force used on already-handcuffed individuals.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court incorrectly found that placing a knee on Miller''s back for a few seconds in order to facilitate handcuffing constituted excessive force under clearly established law.

  3. Appellants argued that the district court erred in finding a clearly established duty for Jackson to intervene in Roycroft''s use of force, asserting that there was no indication Jackson delayed his efforts or could have realistically prevented the force used.

  4. Appellants asserted that the district court improperly relied on disputed factual inferences, such as whether Miller was resisting or struggling to breathe, and whether Miller posed a threat to the officers or others, which should have been resolved in their favor for purposes of qualified immunity.

  5. Appellants claimed that the district court erred by not crediting their version of the facts, including that Roycroft''s arm was trapped under Miller until just before Miller was handcuffed and that no knee or pressure was placed on Miller''s back after the handcuffs were applied.

  6. Appellants argued that the district court erred in finding that Miller was not resisting and that the officers should have known he was struggling to breathe, contending that they could have reasonably believed Miller was offering resistance and that he posed a danger due to his behavior prior to the 911 call.

  7. Appellants contended that the district court erred in denying summary judgment on the state wrongful-death claim to the extent it was dependent on the excessive-force claim.'
