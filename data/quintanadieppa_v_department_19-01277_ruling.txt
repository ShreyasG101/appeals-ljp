FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO                     

CARMEN QUINTANA-DIEPPA,                                                   

     Plaintiff,                        Civil No. 19-1277 (ADC)            

     v.                                                                   

DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY,                                                   

     Defendant.                                                           

                        OPINION AND ORDER                                 
    Before the Court is defendant the Department of the Army’s (“the Army” or “defendant”) 
motion  for  summary  judgment  and  plaintiff  Carmen  Quintana-Dieppa’s  (“Quintana”  or 
“plaintiff”) opposition thereto. ECF Nos. 93, 110. For the reasons below, the Army’s motion for 
summary judgment is GRANTED.                                               
 I. Background                                                            
    Quintana, a 62-year-old female, filed suit against the Army on March 28, 2019. She lodged 
claims of age discrimination pursuant to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 
sex and racial discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VII”), and retaliation 
in violation of Title VII and the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”).1 ECF No. 1. See also 29 U.S.C. 
§ 621 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. § 2000 et seq.; 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3). Quintana also alleged she was subjected 
to a hostile work environment due to her gender in violation of Title VII. ECF No. 1 at 11. 


1 Additional claims have already been dismissed by the Court. See ECF No. 24.  
    Quintana’s suit stems from seven alleged incidents that are purportedly adverse actions 
suffered by her and taken by the Army out of a discriminatory or retaliatory animus in violation 
of ADEA, Title VII and the FLSA. These are:                                
      1.  An e-mail sent to Quintana by a supervisor recommending she apply for an open 

         position at a different Army base. ECF No. 1 at 8.               
      2.  A  performance  evaluation  given  to  Quintana  by  a  supervisor  in  which  she 
         received a lower grade than she had in previous evaluations. Id. 
      3.  Quintana’s supervisor’s failure to provide her with performance standards. Id.  

      4.  Denial of a promotion Quintana had requested. Id.               
      5.  Placing Quintana on leave and transferring her to another position. ECF No. 1 at 
         9.                                                               

      6.  A text message sent to Quintana by a supervisor questioning her absence from 
         work on a specific date. Id.                                     
      7.  An incident in which Quintana was asked to report to work while on leave and 
         then told to go home once she arrived. Id.                       

    Now, the Army moves for summary judgment, maintaining inter alia that Quintana 
cannot establish – even in a prima facie manner – that the Army acted with a discriminatory or 
retaliatory animus in any of the above-mentioned incidents.2               


2 The Army also argued Quintana failed to exhaust administrative remedies, but it misses the mark. That argument 
was likely waived because the EEOC reached the merits of Quintana’s charge without noting its tardiness, and the 
Army did not raise it earlier. See Mercado v. Ritz-Carlton San Juan Hotel, Spa & Casino, 410 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir. 2015).  
 II. Summary Judgment Standard                                            
    Through summary judgment, courts “pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay 
the parties’ proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.” Wynne v. Tufts Univ. 
Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992). The Supreme Court encourages employing 

summary judgment in federal courts – it “[avoids] full blown trials in unwinnable cases, … 
[conserves]  parties’  time  and  money,  and  [permits]  the  court  to  husband  scarce  judicial 
resources.” McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 56 F.3d 313, 314 (1st Cir. 1995). See also Celotex 
Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986).                                     

    A court may grant summary judgment only when the pleadings and the evidence 
demonstrate that “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled 
to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). See also Sands v. Ridefilm Corp., 212 F.3d 

657, 660 (1st Cir. 2000). A factual dispute is “genuine” if it could be resolved in favor of either 
party, and “material” if it potentially affects the outcome of the case. See Calero-Cerezo v. U.S. 
Dep’t of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004). The court must review the record “taken as a whole,” 
and “may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.” Reeves v. Anderson 

Plumbing Productions Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 135 (2000). Credibility determinations, the weighing of 
the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are functions of a jury, not 
of a judge. See id.                                                        

    In short, when there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact, and when a court would 
be  required  to  make  credibility  determinations,  weigh  the  evidence,  or  draw  legitimate 
inferences from the facts in order to adjudicate a controversy, summary judgment will not be 
granted. While no legitimate inferences can be drawn, the court will construe all reasonable 
inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. See Stoutt v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 158 F. Supp. 
2d 167, 171 (D.P.R. 2001). Still, the nonmoving party is required to demonstrate “through 

submissions of evidentiary quality that a trial worthy issue persists.” Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 
F.3d 94, 108 (1st Cir. 2006).                                              
 III. Preliminary Matters                                                 
    At the threshold, the Court must stop to address some fatal shortcomings in Quintana’s 

opposition to defendant’s motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 110. When responding to a 
motion for summary judgment, parties must abide by certain rules. For example, parties must 
set forth any proposed uncontested material facts (or rebukes thereto) in numbered paragraphs 

neatly containing the facts in question, devoid of argumentation and accompanied by specific 
citations to record materials of evidentiary value that either prove a proposed fact or disprove 
an opposed one. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; D.P.R. L. R. 56. Quintana has glaringly failed to comply 
with this rule, and others as well.                                        

    Under Local Rule 56(c):                                               
    A party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its  
    opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts. The 
    opposing statement shall admit, deny or qualify the facts supporting the 
    motion for summary judgment… Unless a fact is admitted, the opposing  
    statement shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation as 
    required by this rule…                                                
D.P.R. L. R. 56(c). If a party improperly controverts the facts, the court may treat those facts as 
uncontroverted. See Natal Pérez v. Oriental Bank & Tr., 291 F.Supp.3d 215, 219 (D.P.R. 2018). 
Litigants who ignore the rule do so “at their peril.” Puerto Rico American Ins. Co. v. Rivera–
Vázquez, 603 F.3d 125, 131 (1st Cir. 2010). Furthermore, the Court “shall have no independent 

duty to search or consider any part of the record not specifically referenced in the parties’ 
separate statement of facts.” D.P.R. L.R. 56(e). See also Advanced Flexible Circuits, Inc. v. GE Sensing 
& Inspection Techs. GmbH, 781 F.3d 510, 521 (1st Cir. 2015) (noting that failure to comply with the 
standards of Local Rule 56 by the nonmovant allows the district court to accept the moving 

party’s facts as stated).                                                  
    Quintana  opposed  or  qualified  defendant’s  statements  of  uncontested  material  fact 
(“DSUMFs”) 8, 14, 28, 29, 31, 33, 37, 38, 39, 46, 47, 51, 54, 57, 60, 61, 62, 63, 67, 75, 76, 85, 89, and 

90. See ECF No. 110-1, Plaintiff’s Opposing Statement of Facts (“POSF”). However, the only 
qualification that comes close to succeeding (albeit partially) is that to DSUMF 60, in which the 
Army posits that plaintiff was not functionally denied a promotion and Quintana responds that 
she requested a promotion, but her request was denied, and submits deposition testimony to 

that effect. See PSOF 60. All other oppositions refer to record citations that do not lend support 
to Quintana’s propositions (POSF 8, 28, 29, 31, 33, 38, 47, 51, 57, 61, 62, 63, 67, 85), include 
propositions that do not contradict the Army’s DSUMFs (POSF 8, 29, 31, 33, 37, 38, 39, 51, 54, 

57, 61, 67), or forego citations to the record altogether (POSF 14, 46, 75, 76, 89, 90).  
    For  example,  DSUMF  8  states  that  Quintana  was  the  subject  of  an  investigation. 
However, Quintana’s opposition at PSOF 8 states only that Quintana “did not know” she was 
one of the subjects of the investigation and then cites six record materials that neither support 
that position nor contradict the underlying premise of DSUMF 8. Similar problems permeate 

Quintana’s entire opposition. As far as the Court can tell, Quintana copy-pasted the same four 
record citations throughout most of her oppositions without regard to the matters asserted. To 
boot, in PSOFs 31 and 33, Quintana egregiously mischaracterizes a witness’s testimony.3 Such 
a transgression, be it by design or out of carelessness and ignorance, is beyond the pale.  

    For all the foregoing, Quintana fails to properly contest the Army’s proposed uncontested 
material facts (except DSUMF 60, and then only partially).                 
    Furthermore, Quintana attempts to add facts by way of her oppositions, and even 

admissions, of the Army’s DSUMFs. For example, Quintana admits DSUMF 1, and then 
includes a full paragraph with additional – and unsupported – facts. PSOF 1. Quintana attempts 
to include similar additional facts throughout her opposition. However, additional facts must 
be put forward in a separate section, and “set forth in separate numbered paragraphs and 

supported by a record citation as required by subsection (e) of this rule.” D.P.R. L. R. 56(c). “This 
separate section containing additional facts is necessary to allow the moving party to reply to 


3 There, plaintiff cites the witness as stating that plaintiff’s reassignment “had nothing to do” with the results of an 
investigation the Army conducted (generally alluded to as “AR-15”) – but the witness actually stated that an 
unrelated Army regulation (generally alluded to as “Regulation 215”) had “nothing to do with the [investigation].” 
Compare PSOFs 31 and 33 with ECF 110-7 at 65-66. Both plaintiff’s reassignment and the investigation will be 
discussed in detail below.                                                 
those additional facts and to allow the court to easily determine the disputed facts.” Malavé-
Torres  v.  Cusido,  919  F.  Supp.  2d  198,  207  (D.P.R.  2013).  A  party  thus  may  not  include 
numerous additional facts within its opposition to the moving party's statements of uncontested 
facts. See Acevedo–Parrilla v. Novartis Ex–Lax, Inc., 696 F.3d 128, 137 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing Carreras 

v. Sajo, García & Partners, 596 F.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir. 2010) (rejecting argument that Local Rule 56(c) 
does not require separate section for additional facts)). See also Malavé-Torres, 919 F.Supp.2d at 
207 (nonmoving party “may not include numerous additional facts within its opposition to the 
moving party’s statements of uncontested facts.”).  As such, per Local Rule 56, all additional 

facts set forth within plaintiff’s opposition of the Army’s DSUMF shall be disregarded. 
    Quintana did include additional facts in a separate section. See ECF No. 110-1 at 27-31.  
Yet, she did not set forth these additional facts in separate numbered paragraphs, as required 

by Local Rule 56(c). Id. The government, understandably, complained. ECF No. 132. The Court 
should therefore ignore these additional facts because of the undue burden they place upon the 
Army and the Court. Still, even if the Court considered them, they are by-and-large irrelevant 
and would not tilt the needle in a different direction.                    

    The Court notes that this is not the first time the Court has needed to call attention to 
plaintiff’s counsels’ performance or conduct in this case. ECF No. 155 (“Plaintiff clearly warned 
that the next filing containing unsubstantiated allegations, innuendos or mischaracterizations 

of the record, opposing counsel's posture or allegations will be directly addressed by the 
imposition of economic sanctions or other measures.”); ECF No. 148 (“particularly plaintiff's 
counsel who in spite of previous orders of the Court continues to make unfounded allegations, 
mischaracterizations and introducing irrelevant facts that affect camaraderie”); ECF No. 127 
(“Plaintiffs failed to appear at today’s status conference and the courtroom deputy attempted 
but remained unable to contact counsel. Defendants waited for 1 hour and the conference was 

adjourned.”); ECF No. 108 (“In light of recent events that have transpired in the case, attorneys 
of record were strongly admonished, and the Court will not allow any mischaracterization on 
pending matters be brought forth within the contents of the documents to be submitted for the 
Court's consideration.”).4                                                 

 IV. Factual Findings                                                     
    In accordance with the foregoing, the Court finds that the following material facts are 
uncontested:                                                               

 i. Quintana’s first complaint with the EEOC:                             
    Quintana was employed by the Army as a Child Youth and School Services (“CYSS”) 
Coordinator at Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico. DSUMF 1. In September of 2014, she filed a 
complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) alleging that she 

had been discriminated against on the basis of her national origin. DSMUF 2. An administrative 
judge entered judgment in favor of the Army in July of 2017. DSUMF 5.      


4 The Court also notes that plaintiff’s submitted exhibits are not properly organized. The exhibits are not numbered, 
and the titles used do not match up with the titles referred to throughout the POSF. The pages of the depositions 
filed are out of order, as well. See ECF Nos. 110-6 and 110-7. This only makes it harder for the Court to do its job. In 
addition, the Court respectfully requests that counsels for the plaintiff avoid abusing bold and italic characters, 
since it does not augment plaintiff’s arguments. See inter alia ECF Nos. 110, 110-1.  
 ii. First Investigation:                                                 
    Following allegations of mismanagement and poor work conditions, the 81st Regional 
Support Command, based in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, initiated an investigation into Fort 
Buchanan’s Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation (“FMWR”) Division in May of 2016. 

DSUMF 7.  Quintana, along with the FMWR supervisory chain, was one of the subjects of that 
investigation.5 DSUMF 8. Upon completion of the investigation, the investigating officer found 
that Quintana did “not always treat subordinates with dignity and respect or foster a healthy 
command climate” and that her “authoritative and brash leadership style [had] fostered a toxic 

work environment.” DSUMFs 11 and 12 (quoting ECF No. 94-3 at 13). The Commanding General 
at Fort Jackson accepted the results of the investigation but did not act upon them – instead, he 
forwarded them to the Garrison Commander at Fort Buchanan. Id. See also DSUMF 13. 

 iii. Follow-Up Investigation:                                            
    Fort Buchanan’s Garrison Commander, COL Michael T. Harvey (“COL Harvey”), after 
receiving the results of the investigation, requested a second investigation be conducted into 
Quintana’s treatment of her subordinates. DSUMFs 15 and 16. That follow-up investigation 

began in late August of 2016 and concluded a little over a month later, in early October. DSUMF 



5 Specifically, issue #7 of the investigation asked whether Quintana had “violated [Army regulations] by not treating 
her subordinates with dignity and respect, characterized by harassing, threatening or intimidating behavior and 
language with specific instances of abuse of authority, disrespect, threats, fear tactics, favoritism, intimidation and 
retaliation?” DSUMF 9 (quoting ECF No. 94-3 at 9).                         
15. The investigating officer, after gathering sworn statements and documentary evidence 
(DSUMF 24), made the following findings:                                   
 1.  Twenty-seven individuals “confirmed” being the object of or witnessing “disrespectful or 
   disparaging behavior by Ms. Quintana.” DSUMF 17 (quoting ECF No. 94-4 at 2). 

 2.  “Favoritism,  Disrespect,  Intimidating  language/behavior,  and  Retaliation  were  most 
   prominent.” Id.                                                        
 3.   “About half of CYSS’ [sic] workforce rated Ms. Quintana’s leadership unfavorably.” 
   DSUMF 18 (quoting ECF No. 94-4 at 2).                                  

 4.  “Personnel leave and staffing is poorly addressed and managed.” DSUMF 19 (quoting 
   ECF No. 94-4 at 3).                                                    
 5.  “There  is  a  hostile  and  tense  work  environment  at  CYSS.  Employees  are  afraid  of 

   [Quintana].  Quintana  controls  everything,  stifles  employees’  initiative.  DSUMF  20 
   (quoting ECF No. 94-4 at 4).                                           
 6.  Quintana  “micromanages  CYSS”  and  “gets  personally  involved  in  a  myriad  [of] 
   inordinate  matters  that  should  be  instead  addressed  by  her  subordinate  directors.” 

   DSUMF 21 (quoting ECF No. 94-4 at 4).                                  
 7.  “Ms. Quintana treated her employees with lack of dignity and respect.” DSUMF 22 
   (quoting ECF No. 94-4 at 5).                                           

 8.  “The pattern of misconduct warrants disciplinary action.” DSUMF 23 (quoting ECF No. 
   94-4 at 6).                                                            
 iv. The Reassignment:                                                    
    After receiving the results of the second investigation, COL Harvey, Fort Buchanan’s 
Garrison Commander, signed off on a letter of reassignment to be issued to Quintana on January 
25, 2017 by her then supervisor, Daniel Carter (“Carter”). DSUMF 27. However, two days 

earlier, President Donald J. Trump issued a hiring freeze that was not lifted until April 12, 2017. 
DSUMFs 28 and 29. For that reason, the letter of reassignment’s issuance was delayed. Id.  
    In June of 2017, Carter (Quintana’s supervisor) vacated his position as FMWR Programs 
Director (and as Quintana’s supervisor) and was replaced by Todd Scalf (“Scalf”). DSUMFs 26, 

30 and 37. Scalf reviewed the files pertaining to the aforesaid investigations and thereafter 
signed a revised letter of reassignment, transferring Quintana to a newly created position with 
the same pay and grade. DSUMFs 31 and 32. The letter of reassignment specified that the 

“justification for this action is that management has serious and substantiated concerns about 
your management style, which is not conductive to an adequate child care [sic] environment” 
and then noted several of the findings in the investigation reports. DSUMFs 33, 34 and 35. The 
letter was issued to Quintana at a meeting on November 17, 2017. DSUMF 36. She was placed 

on a one-day administrative leave immediately after the meeting. DSUMF 64; ECF 94-5 at 196.  
    During January of 2018, Wendy Winston (“Winston”) – who is a Hispanic female – took 
on  Quintana’s  duties  temporarily.  DSUMF  38.  Then,  on  January  31,  2018,  Aida  Aguilú 

(“Aguilú”) was named Acting CYSS Coordinator. Id. A year later, Aguilú was formally selected 
to fill the role on a permanent basis. DSUMF 39. Aguilú is a Hispanic female and is only about 
a year and two months younger than Quintana. DSUMFs 40 and 41.             
 v. E-Mail Re: Position in Maryland                                       
    Carter  forwarded  Quintana  an  e-mail  in  June  of  2016  regarding  an  open  CYSS 

Coordinator position in Maryland.6 DSUMF 46. Carter said he forwarded the posting because 
Quintana had expressed numerous times she wanted to leave Fort Buchanan, “that she had too 
much on her plate, her health was doing well and the job was becoming stressful.” DSUMF 47. 
 vi. Unfavorable Performance Evaluation                                   

    In January of 2017, Quintana received a performance evaluation for the period of July 1, 
2015 to June 30, 2016. DSUMFs 48 and 49. Carter rated her performance as “satisfactory,” 
because she had met certain standards but had not expanded the youth sports and youth school 

programs. DSUMFs 49 and 50. Carter noted that these programs were “weak.” DSUMF 51. In 
her previous evaluation (for the period of July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015), Quintana’s performance 
had been rated as “outstanding.” DSUMF 52. Quintana stated, under oath, that it was “obvious” 
that the lower rating was “tied to the 15-6 [investigation] results and professional jealousy.” 

DSUMF 53.                                                                  
 vii. Performance Standards Not Provided                                  
    Quintana alleges that no performance standards or appraisals were issued to her for the 

period starting in July 2016 and ending in June 2017. DSUMF 54. Carter testified that during his 

6 The content of the e-mail is included at fn.19.                          
time  as  the  acting  Program  Director  of  FMWR,  neither  Quintana,  nor  any  of  the  fifteen 
employees Carter supervised received new performance standards. DSUMFs 55 and 56. At least 
three other employees did not receive performance appraisals for the same time period. DSUMF 
57. See also ECF No. 94-5 at 203-204. Carter acknowledged that the missing performance reviews 

were a failure of his supervisory role, due to a heavy workload and an understaffed department. 
DSUMF 56                                                                   
 viii. Promotion Refusal                                                  
    In May of 2017, Quintana informed Carter she had reviewed a version of the CYSS 

manning  document  and  believed  that,  based  on  that  document,  she  needed  to  be  non-
competitively promoted to a NF-05 Coordinator position – despite that the manning document 
constituted  preliminary  guidance  issued  in  advance  of  any  mandate  by  the  U.S.  Army 

Installation Management Command (“IMCOM”) G-9 (which commands FMWR and CYSS). 
DSUMFs 61 and 62. Carter did not submit an electronic request for personnel action promoting 
Quintana to the position she had requested because Fort Buchanan’s CYSS program did not fit 
the  demographics  required  for  that  position  by  the  Army  NAF  Standardized  Position 

Description. DSUMF 63.                                                     
 ix. November 2017 Text Message                                           
    On November 20, 2017, Scalf sent Quintana a text message asking about her whereabouts 

because she had not reported for work that day.7 DSUMF 64. Quintana perceived the message 

7 The content of the text message is included at fn.20.                    
as disrespectful. DSUMF 65. The record does not indicate that Quintana was on preapproved 
leave or otherwise notified Scalf that she would be taking sick leave before he contacted her by 
text message.  DSUMF 66.                                                   
 x. January 2018 Incidents                                                

    On January 4, 2018, Scalf sent Quintana a “report to work” text message. DSUMF 68. On 
January 5, Quintana explained to Scalf that she was on leave through that day. DSUMF 69. Scalf 
believed, erroneously, that Quintana’s leave had concluded on January 3 because of a mix-up 
with the leave documents. DSUMFs 68, 69 and 71. Upon noticing his mistake, Scalf sent 

Quintana home. ECF No. 94-5 at 194.                                        
 V. Discussion                                                            
    Plaintiff lodges claims of age discrimination pursuant to ADEA, gender and racial 

discrimination pursuant to Title VII, and retaliation in violation of Title VII and the FLSA. The 
Court will first address plaintiff’s claims of age, gender and racial discrimination under ADEA 
and Title VII.                                                             
 1.  ADEA and Title VII Discrimination                                    

    ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to “fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any 
individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, 
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s age.” Vélez v. 

Thermo King de Puerto Rico, Inc., 585 F.3d 441, 446 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1)). 
The Supreme Court has clarified that, regardless of whether direct or circumstantial evidence is 
used to support an ADEA claim, and of whether a burden shifting analysis is employed by the 
court, plaintiffs must “establish that age was the ‘but for’ cause of the employer’s adverse 
action.” Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2351 (2009). Notwithstanding, there is no 
“heightened  evidentiary  requirement”  for  plaintiffs  to  satisfy  their  burden  of  persuasion 

through “direct evidence” as opposed to “circumstantial evidence.” Id. at 2351 n. 4. The rule is 
simply that “[a] plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct 
or circumstantial), that age was the ‘but for’ cause of the challenged employer decision.” Id. 
(citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 141 143, 147 (2000)).  

    Title VII, which prohibits discrimination because of sex and nationality, provides “that 
‘[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer … to discriminate against any 
individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, 

because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Oncale v. Sundower 
Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998) (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e– 2(a)(1)).) 
    In the absence of direct or “smoking gun” evidence, ADEA plaintiffs may nonetheless 
prove their cases by using the three-stage burden shifting framework set forth in McDonnell 

Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). See Meléndez v. Autogermana, Inc., 622 F.3d 46, 50 (1st 
Cir. 2010). Title VII discrimination claims too are “ordinarily subject to the familiar McDonnell 
Douglas burden-shifting framework.” Caraballo-Caraballo v. Corr. Admin., 892 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir. 

2018). See also Cruz v. Mattis, 861 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2017); Henderson v. Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Auth., 384 F. Supp. 3d 199, 204 (D. Mass. 2019), aff'd, 977 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2020).  
    Per the burden-shifting framework, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of 
discrimination. See Thermo King, 585 F.3d at 447-48. After the prima facie showing is made, the 
burden then shifts to the employer to show that its purportedly retaliatory action was in fact the 
result of a legitimate non-retaliatory reason. Id. If the employer makes this showing, the burden 

shifts back to the plaintiff to rebut the employer's evidence by demonstrating that the employer's 
purported  nonretaliatory  reasons  were  not  its  true  reasons,  but  rather  a  pretext  for 
discrimination. Id.“Where, as here, a plaintiff opposing summary judgment does not have direct 
evidence of discrimination, we apply the burden-shifting framework.” Joseph v. Lincare, Inc., 989 

F.3d 147, 157 (1st Cir. 2021).                                             
    A.  Prima Facie Case                                                  
    The Army argues that Quintana cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination. 

While “only a minimal evidentiary showing is necessary to satisfy an employee’s burden of 
production at this stage,” Torrech Hernández v. General Elec. Co., 519 F.3d 41, 49 (1st Cir. 2008), 
Quintana has not hit that mark here with regards to her age, sex and racial discrimination claims.  
    The Court will address each adverse action individually.8             


8 The Court will not discuss (a) the e-mail Carter sent to Quintana, (b) the text message Scalf sent Quintana telling 
her to report to work on a day she was absent, and (c) an incident in which Quintana was mistakenly told to report 
to work while on leave and then sent home when the mistake was discovered, because they are not adverse actions. 
Cherkaoui v. City of Quincy, 877 F.3d 14, 25 (1st Cir. 2017) (“An adverse employment action is one that affects 
employment or alters the conditions of the workplace.”). Adverse acts “typically involve discrete changes in the 
terms  of  employment,  such  as  hiring,  firing,  failing  to  promote,  reassignment  with  significantly  different 
responsibilities, or a decision causing significant change in benefits.” Cham v. Station Operators, Inc., 685 F.3d 87, 94 
(1st Cir. 2012). “Petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience 
fall outside the scope of the anti-discrimination laws.” Natal Pérez v. Oriental Bank & Tr., 291 F. Supp. 3d 215, 235 
(D.P.R. 2018). This applies to ADEA and Title VII claims.  Id. at 226. Even if these three incidents were adverse 
      i. The Transfer                                                     
    Involuntary  transfers  to  less  desirable  positions  are  often  treated  as  constructive 
discharges. Lebofsky v. City of Philadelphia, 394 F. App'x 935, 939 (3d Cir. 2010). In cases where an 
employer is not conducting a reduction in force, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie claim of 

discrimination by showing that: (1) they were part of a protected group; (2) they met the 
employer's  legitimate  job  performance  expectations;  (3)  they  experienced  an  adverse 
employment action; and (4) the employer had a continuing need for the services provided 
previously by the plaintiff. See Velázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc., 476 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 

2007); Suárez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2000).      
    Quintana was involuntary transferred to a less desirable position. DSUMFs 31, 32 36. 
    “When determining whether an employee’s performance met the employer’s legitimate 

expectations, an employee’s perception of himself is not relevant. Rather, it is the perception of 
the decision maker which is relevant.” Navedo v. Nalco Chemical, Inc., 848 F.Supp.2d 171, 193 
(D.P.R. 2012) (cleaned up). Quintana has not pointed to record materials, nor otherwise made 
an evidentiary showing, that she met the employer's legitimate job performance expectations. 

See Velázquez-Fernández, 476 F.3d at 11. On the other hand, the Army has flooded the record with 
materials of evidentiary value that support the proposition that Quintana was not meeting her 


actions, they could not carry a discrimination claim here – Quintana does not demonstrate that these actions 
constituted disparate treatment, were taken out of a discriminatory animus or were curtained by pretextual 
justifications. Thus, the ADEA and Title VII claims as pertain to these three incidents are DISMISSED WITH 
PREJUDICE.                                                                 
employer’s legitimate job expectations in several ways. See DSUMFs 11 and 12 (stating that 
Quintana’s leadership style was authoritative and brash, and she had fostered a toxic work 
environment); 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 (describing deficiencies in Quintana’s leadership, 
such  as  exhibiting  disrespectful  and  disparaging  behavior  towards  employees  and  poor 

management);  33,  34,  34,  and  35  (management  had  “serious  and  substantiated  concerns” 
regarding  Quintana’s  management  style,  which  was  termed  to  not  be  “conductive  to  an 
adequate child care [sic] environment”); 50 (Quintana had not expanded the youth sports and 
youth school programs); and 51 (the programs headed by Quintana were noted as “weak”). 

And, as aforenoted, Quintana failed to contest or challenge the cited DSUMFs. Even with “the 
minimal evidentiary showing [that] is necessary to satisfy an employee’s burden of production 
at this stage,” the omission is glaring and likely fatal. Torrech Hernández, 519 F.3d at 49.  

    Instead, Quintana relies on stating, without more, in her response to the Army’s motion 
for summary judgment, that Quintana had worked for the Army for over 30 years “and no prior 
history [of prior poor performance or admonishments.]” ECF 110 at 7. Such a statement, 
unsupported by record materials and unsubmitted as a material fact, is inconsequential at the 

summary judgment stage. Quintana’s 30 years of employment and accompanying performance 
record were not submitted as material facts to the Court, and Quintana did not reference record 
materials  to  that  effect.  The  First  Circuit  has  held  “with  a  regularity  bordering  on  the 

monotonous that parties ignore the strictures of an ‘anti-ferret’ rule at their peril.” Rivera–
Vázquez, 603 F.3d at 131.                                                  
    In Woodman, the Court found that a plaintiff had “cleared [the McDonnell Douglas prima 
facie] hurdle with his proffer of substantial wage increases and ten years of positive performance 
reviews, blemished by but one negative performance evaluation five days prior to the reduction 
in force.” Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1092 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Woods v. Friction 

Materials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 261 (1st Cir. 1994) (history of largely favorable performance reviews 
and extensive experience in industry adequate to generate at least a genuine issue as to plaintiff-
employee's ability to meet legitimate job expectations)). A similar evidentiary proffer is absent 
here. 9 Quintana, unlike the Woodman plaintiff, cannot clear the hurdle on the record presently 

before the Court.                                                          
    Notwithstanding, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has consistently held that “we cannot 
consider the employer’s alleged nondiscriminatory reason for taking an adverse employment 

action when analyzing the prima facie case.” Autogermana, 622 F.3d at 51 (citing Wexler v. White’s 
Fine Furniture, Inc., 317 F.3d 564, 574 (6th Cir.2 003)). See also Thermo King, 585 F.3d at 448 (finding 
as  error  that  the  district  court  “accepted  for  the  purpose  of  the  prima  facie  analysis  [the 
employer’s] stated reason for firing [the plaintiff] as proof that he was not qualified for the … 

job”). The situation here is different, however, because Quintana has not made any showing at all 
as to whether she was meeting her employer’s legitimate expectations. So, rather than accepting 


9 The Army submitted an uncontested statement of material fact that Quintana received an “outstanding” 
performance review for the period of July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015. However, evidence of a single favorable 
performance review is not enough to meet even the low standard set forth in Woodman. If there is more evidence of 
favorable performance reviews in the record, Quintana has failed to adequately call the Court’s attention to them. 
See Rivera–Vázquez, 603 F.3d at 131 (“parties ignore the strictures of an ‘anti-ferret’ rule at their peril”).  
the Army’s stated reasons for transferring Quintana, the Court is instead holding simply that 
Quintana failed to satisfy even the low burden placed upon her by the McDonnell Douglas 
framework at the prima facie step. See Torrech Hernández, 519 F.3d at 49 (a “minimal evidentiary 
showing is necessary to satisfy an employee’s burden of production at this stage”).   

    Still, the Court will run Quintana’s discrimination claims pertaining to the involuntary 
transfer through the McDonnell Douglas gamut, if only for the sake of ensuring that Quintana’s 
performance record was not tarnished by the Army as a pretext to enable a liability-free transfer.  
      ii. The Performance Evaluation and the Performance Standards        

    With regards to the “satisfactory” performance evaluation she received in January of 
2017, DSUMFs 48 and 49, and Quintana’s claim that no performance standards or appraisals 
were issued to her for the period starting in July 2016 and ending in June 2017, DSUMF 54, the 

litmus test for a prima facie case changes. To establish a disparate treatment case here, Quintana 
must show that she was treated more severely, or at least not class neutrally, as compared to 
others similarly situated and outside her age, sex or race protected classes. See 6 Emp. Coord. 
Employment Practices § 57:20; Cham v. Station Operators, Inc., 685 F.3d 87, 93-94 (1st Cir. 2012).  

    Quintana did not submit any record materials to form a minimal showing that her lower 
than usual performance review was discriminatory in any fashion or that similarly situated 
employees not belonging to her age, sex or race protected classes were graded more favorably. 

In fact, Quintana instead stated, under oath, that it was “obvious” that the lower rating was 
“tied to the 15-6 [investigation] results and professional jealousy.” DSUMF 53. Even taking these 
superficial averments as true, such reasons are unrelated to discrimination based on age, sex, or 
race under the purview of ADEA and Title VII. See 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. § 2000 et seq. 
Accordingly, Quintana has failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination regarding her 
ADEA and Title VII claims with respect to the performance evaluation.      

    Quintana’s assertion that no performance standards or appraisals were issued to her for 
the period starting in July 2016 and ending in June 2017 fares no better. Here, Quintana 
continues the trend of not submitting record materials to form a minimal showing in support of 
a prima facie case of discrimination. Quintana does not contend or point to evidence that indicates 

that similarly situated employees not belonging to her age, sex or race protected classes were 
provided performance standards. This is fatal to her attempt at formulating a prima facie ADEA 
and Title VII discrimination case with regards to the performance standards that were not 

provided to her. Moreover, it is uncontested that, besides Quintana, a number of employees 
under Carter’s supervision did not receive performance standards or appraisals during the 
relevant time period. DSUMFs 54, 55 and 56. Quintana accordingly fails.    
      iii. Promotion Denial                                               

    Quintana requested a promotion, but her request was denied, and she submits deposition 
testimony to that effect. See DSUMF 60; PSOF 60.                           
    To satisfy the prima facie burden of ADEA and Title VII failure to promote claims, 

Quintana must show that: “(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for the 
promotion; (3) she was rejected; and (4) that other similarly or less qualified employees, who 
were not members of the protected class, were promoted.” Rodríguez-Torres v. Gov't Dev. Bank of 
Puerto Rico, 704 F. Supp. 2d 81, 95 (D.P.R. 2010) (cleaned up). “In ADEA claims, the [p]laintiff 
must also show that the person promoted instead of [p]laintiff was significantly younger than 
[p]laintiff and had similar qualifications.” Id. (citing O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 

517 U.S. 308, 313 (1996)).                                                 
    Quintana cannot successfully establish a prima facie showing of discrimination on her 
failure to promote claims because she does not point to evidence in the record showing that 
anybody was promoted, much less somebody similarly or less qualified to Quintana who was 

outside of her age, sex, or race protected groups. Quintana has accordingly failed to establish a 
prima facie showing of discrimination on her failure to promote claims. Quintana has also failed 
to submit evidence that she was qualified for the promotion, or that the position she sought even 

existed at Fort Buchanan.10 She, thus, has not established a prima facie case of discrimination as 
it pertains to her failure to promote claims.                              
    B.  Burden shift                                                      
    For the sake of thoroughness, the Court notes that even if Quintana had established a 

prima facie showing of discrimination regarding all the aforementioned claims, her ADEA and 
Title VII claims would still fail because her claims would falter in the later stages of the 
McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework.                               


10 It is uncontested that Fort Buchanan’s CYSS program did not fit the demographics required by the Army NAF 
Standardized Position Description for the position Quintana sought. DSUMF 63. 
    As the First Circuit set forth in Thermo King, if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie 
showing of age based discrimination, the court proceeds as follows:        
    The burden of production then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non 
    discriminatory reason for its decisions. If the employer articulates such a reason, 
    the McDonnell Douglas framework with its presumptions and burdens is no longer 
    relevant. At this stage, the sole remaining issue is discrimination vel non. A plaintiff 
    must be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 
    the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were 
    a pretext for discrimination.                                         

585 F.3d at 447-48 (cleaned up).                                           
    The Army moved evidence into the record that Quintana was transferred (and placed on 
a one-day administrative leave that was incidental to the transfer) because “management ha[d] 
serious and substantiated concerns about [her] management style, which is not conductive to an 
adequate child care [sic] environment” and then noted several of the findings in the reports of 
two investigations conducted by the Army into Quintana’s conduct and performance. DSUMFs 
33, 34, 35 and 36.  The Army also pointed to record materials that showed that Quintana had 
received a lower-than-usual performance review because she had met certain standards but had 
not expanded the youth sports and youth school programs, which were also noted as “weak.” 
DSUMFs 49, 50 and 51. With regards to the performance standards and appraisals that were 
not provided for the June 2016-June 2017 period, the Army pointed to evidence explaining that 
the missing performance standards and appraisals were a failure on Carter’s part as supervisor 

and  were  a  widespread  deficiency  within  his  department  due  to  a  heavy  workload  and 
understaffed department. DSUMF 56. With regards to Quintana’s failure to promote claims, the 
Army produced evidence on record to prove that Carter did not promote Quintana because Fort 
Buchanan’s  CYSS  program  did  not  fit  the  demographics  required  by  the  Army  NAF 
Standardized Position Description for the position that Quintana believed she was entitled to a 
promotion  for.  DSUMF  63.  Thus,  the  Army  has  successfully  established  legitimate,  non-

discriminatory reasons for its decisions. See Thermo King, 585 F.3d at 447.  
    C.  Pretext                                                           
    The Court therefore now moves to the third and final step of the McDonnell Douglas 
framework, where the burden is on plaintiff to show that defendant’s asserted reason for its 

decisions was a pretext for discrimination. See Santangelo v. New York Life Ins. Co., 785 F.3d 65, 
70 (1st Cir. 2015). “To meet that burden, ‘[i]t is not enough for a plaintiff merely to impugn the 
veracity of the employer’s justification; he must ‘elucidate specific facts which would enable a 

jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up the 
employer’s real motive.’” Santangelo, 785 F.3d at 70 (1st Cir. 2015) (citing Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 
950 F.2d 816, 824 (1st Cir. 1991)). “Pretext can be shown by such weaknesses, implausibilities, 
inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer’s proffered legitimate reasons 

for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and 
hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.” Gómez 
González v. Rural Opportunities, Inc., 626 F.3d 654, 662-663 (1st Cir.2010) (citing Morgan v. Hilti, 

Inc., 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir.1997)).                                
      i. The Transfer and One-Day Leave                                   
    Quintana fails to point to anything in the record that comes close to a showing that the 
Army’s proffered and substantiated reasons for the November 2017 involuntary transfer to a 
less desirable position (and one-day administrative leave that was incidental to the transfer) 

were a pretext to hide a discriminatory animus. In her opposition to the Army’s DSUMF and in 
her additional statement of facts, Quintana cites a witness as stating that plaintiff’s reassignment 
“had nothing to do” with the results of a AR-1511 investigation – but the witness actually stated 
that “regulation 215”12 had “nothing to do with the AR 15-6.” Compare PSOFs 31 and 33; ECF 

No. 110-1 at 30 with ECF 110-7 at 65-66. Similarly, statements to the effect that Carter did not 
know why Quintana was transferred and placed on a one-day leave are irrelevant because she 
has not established that he was involved in the decision to transfer her in the first place. See ECF 

No. 110-1 at 30. The fact that Scalf and Army leadership relied, in part, on the results of the 
second investigation into Quintana’s performance and conduct to transfer her and place her on 
an incidental one-day leave (even if the investigation report did not specifically recommend the 
transfer  and  Scalf  did  not  recall  the  specific  recommendations  at  his  deposition)  is  also 

unavailing to a showing of pretext. See id.13 Indeed, the letter of reassignment stated that 
“management ha[d] serious and substantiated concerns about [her] management style, which is 


11 “AR-15” is a classification of investigation employed by the Army – such as the 2016 investigation into Quintana 
and several others.                                                        
12 Regulation 215 is an unrelated Army regulation. It has no bearing on the Court’s holding.  
13 The additional facts relied on by Quintana to make these assertions need not even be considered by the Court, as 
she did not comply with Local Rule 56 when submitting them. Still, as discussed herein, they do not aid her.  
not conductive to an adequate child care [sic] environment” and then noted several of the 
findings in the reports of two investigations conducted by the Army into Quintana’s conduct 
and performance. DSUMFs 33, 34, 35 and 36. As such, the Army does not contend that Quintana 
was transferred as a direct result of the recommendations of the second investigation, but rather 

due to “serious and substantiated concerns” that were vindicated by the investigation’s results.  
    Furthermore, the Army entered into evidence record materials stating that the appointing 
authority (in this case Army leadership at Fort Buchanan) is “neither bound, nor limited, by the 
findings or recommendations of an investigation.” ECF Nos. 94 at 4 and 94-27 at 15. To boot, the 

first investigation’s recommendations called for Quintana’s transfer. ECF No. 94-3 at 15. See also 
Webber v. Int'l Paper Co., 417 F.3d 229, 238 (1st Cir. 2005); Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 
526, 537 (1st Cir. 1996) (“Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the 

merits—or  even  the  rationality—of  employers'  nondiscriminatory  business  decisions.”) 
(quoting Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991)). In the end, Quintana did not 
submit any record materials to suggest that her transfer was in any way discriminatory,14 to 




14 Quintana does submit an additional fact stating that Roberto Medina (“Medina”), a male, was interviewed to fill 
her former position at some point after April 2018, and was offered the job but he rejected the offer. ECF 110-1 at 
29. However, Quintana does not enter evidence into the record regarding Medina’s age, race or qualifications. Still, 
as pertains to Quintana’s sex discrimination case, that Medina emerged as a leading candidate does not sway the 
Court. By the time Medina was even considered, Quintana’s former position had already been occupied for months 
by women, and one was ultimately chosen to fill it permanently. In ADEA cases, plaintiffs must  “establish that age 
was the ‘but for’ cause of the employer’s adverse action.” Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2351 (2009).  
Notwithstanding, and as the Court has noted multiple times, it need not consider Quintana’s statement of additional 
facts because they were improperly submitted to this Court. See D.P.R. L. R. 56.  
contradict the version of events presented by the Army, or that the Army’s decisions hide behind 
pretexts. The cupboard is truly bare.                                      
    Quintana also references in her response to the Army’s motion for summary judgment, 
in passing, that “comments made by supervisors implied she was too old to continue and sought 

to exclude [her].” ECF No. 110 at 8. However, Quintana did not submit these alleged comments 
for the Court’s consideration. Thus, for summary judgment purposes, they do not exist. See 
D.P.R. L. R. 56. See also Rivera–Vázquez, 603 F.3d at 131.                 
    Quintana accordingly does not meet her burden to “elucidate specific facts which would 

enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to cover up 
the employer’s real motive,” Santangelo, 785 F.3d at 70, or proffer record materials that evince 
“such  weaknesses,  implausibilities,  inconsistencies,  incoherencies,  or  contradictions  in  the 

employer’s  proffered  legitimate  reasons  for  its  action  that  a  reasonable  factfinder  could 
rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the 
asserted non-discriminatory reasons.” Gómez González, 626 F.3d at 662-663.15 Quintana has thus 
failed to demonstrate “through submissions of evidentiary quality that a trial worthy issue 

persists.” Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 108 (1st Cir. 2006).    
    “In  a  case  where  the  first  two  steps  of  the  McDonnell  Douglas  pavane  have  been 
satisfactorily choreographed, a plaintiff must offer some minimally sufficient evidence, direct

later permanently by a Hispanic woman of a similar age. DSUMFs 38, 39, 40 and 41.  
or indirect, both of pretext and of the employer's discriminatory animus to prevail in the face of 
a properly drawn Rule 56 motion.” Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991). 
    Quintana’s ADEA and Title VII discrimination claims pertaining to her transfer and one-
day administrative leave therefore fail. They are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.  

      ii. Other Adverse Actions                                           
    The Court now turns to the other adverse events alleged by Quintana. As to them, 
Quintana does not even formulate a clear attempt to demonstrate that the Army’s stated, 
legitimate reasons were pretextual. Where the standard is to “elucidate specific facts which 

would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to 
cover up the employer’s real motive,” Santangelo, 785 F.3d at 70, or proffer record materials that 
evince “such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in 

the employer’s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could 
rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the 
asserted non-discriminatory reasons,” Gómez González, 626 F.3d at 662-663, the lack of an 
articulated  attack  on  the  Army’s  proffered  reasons  is  fatal.16  Quintana  has  thus  failed  to 

demonstrate “through submissions of evidentiary quality that a trial worthy issue persists.” 
Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 108 (1st Cir. 2006).               




16 To the extent that the discussion in the previous section may be relevant here, it is incorporated by reference.  
    As such, a showing of pretext cannot be sustained. See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825. For the 
foregoing  reasons,  Quintana’s  claims  of  discrimination  under  ADEA  and  Title  VII  are 
DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.                                                  
 2.  Hostile Work Environment                                             

    The Army moves for summary judgment dismissing Quintana’s claims that she was 
subjected to a hostile work environment on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII. The 
Army  argues  that  summary  judgment  should  be  granted  on  Quintana’s  hostile  work 
environment claim because “the ‘harrasment’ she complains of comes nowhere close to being 

objectively severe or pervasive under binding precedent.” ECF No. 93-1 at 3-4. Quintana did not 
respond.                                                                   
    In her complaint, Quintana mentions that she “complained to management about the 

hostile work environment she experienced as a result of the verbally abusive harassment she 
was  subjected  to  by  a  subordinate.”  ECF  1  at  2.  However,  Quintana  did  not  exhaust 
administrative remedies as to any incidents except the seven incidents listed above, supra at 2.17 
See ECF No. 94-5 at 134-35. Quintana is thus barred from raising any claims unrelated to those 




17 These are, again: (1) An e-mail sent to Quintana by a supervisor recommending she apply for an open position at 
a different Army base; (2) A performance evaluation given to Quintana by a supervisor in which she received a 
lower grade than she had in previous evaluations; (3) Quintana’s supervisor’s failure to provide her with 
performance standards; (4) Denial  of a promotion  Quintana requested; (5) Placing  Quintana on leave and 
transferring her to another position; (6) A text message sent to Quintana by a supervisor questioning her absence 
from work on a specific date; (7) An incident in which Quintana was asked to report to work while on leave and 
then told to go home once she arrived. ECF No. 1 at 8-9.                   
seven incidents in federal court.18 Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affs., 514 F.3d 81, 85 (1st Cir. 
2008) (“Before an employee may sue in federal court on a Title VII claim, he must first exhaust 
administrative remedies.”); Labiosa-Herrera v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 153 F. Supp. 3d 541, 548 (D.P.R. 
2016) (granting summary judgment on hostile work environment because plaintiff had failed to 

exhaust administrative remedies).                                          
    The  Court  has  already  ruled  that  four  of  the  seven  alleged  incidents  were 
nondiscriminatory. See supra at 16-27 (ruling that the transfer, the negative performance review, 
the  non-issuance  of  standards  and  appraisals,  and  the  failure  to  promote  were  not 

discriminatory).  They  cannot  moor  Quintana’s  Title  VII  hostile  work  environment  claims 
because such claims must be premised on conduct that is discriminatory. Hernández v. Gutierrez, 
656 F. Supp. 2d 101, 105 (D.D.C. 2009).                                    

    That leaves three events before the Court: (1) An e-mail sent to Quintana by a supervisor 
in June 2016 recommending she apply for an open position at a different Army base,19 (2) a text 
message sent to Quintana by a supervisor in November 2017 regarding her absence from work 



18 Moreover, when asked to identify the instances of harassment she was subjected to, Quintana could not identify 
any instances. DSUMF 73.                                                   
19 The e-mail read as follows:                                             
    Hello Carmen, I was sent this link: [link]. Please don’t take this as I am trying to get rid of you. I 
    think it is important to stay competive. You have been here for 25 years and I think you would be 
    great at a larger garrison. The DFMWR is very nice, compassion [sic] and supportive. Again, I am 
    sending this to you because this could be a great opportunity for you and a new challenge if that is 
    what you desire. I am a person that if I don’t find a challenge, then I get complacent. You are not 
    complacent but I know you like a challenge. BTW AOG is where Lillian is at. Thank you, Dan.  
ECF No. 94-5 at 216.                                                       
on a specific date,20 and (3) an incident in which Quintana was asked to report to work in January 
2018, while on leave, and then told to go home, upon her arrival, when the supervisor realized 
he was mistaken and unaware she was on approved leave.                     
    A  hostile  work  environment  claim  exists  if  a  “workplace  is  permeated  with 

‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult’ that is ‘sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter 
the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment.’” White 
v. N.H. Dep’t of Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2000). There is no “mathematically precise test” 
for determining if conduct reaches the threshold of being so severe or pervasive that it creates a 

work environment abusive to employees. Torres-Santiago v. Alcaraz-Emmanuelli, 617 F. Supp. 2d 
26, 36 (D.P.R. 2009) (quoting Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 22–23 (1993)). To determine 
if a reasonable person would find a work environment hostile or abusive, a court must consider 

the totality of the circumstances. See id. Courts may look to factors such as “the frequency of the 
discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a 
mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work 
performance.” Id. See also Noviello v. City of Boston, 398 F.3d 76, 92 (1st Cir.2005).  

    The conduct underlying Quintana’s hostile work environment claim does not satisfy the 
“severe or pervasive” threshold. For one, the incidents are infrequent, and months apart. A 
single e-mail was sent in June of 2016. DSUMF 46. Then, over a year later, in November 2017, 


20 The text read “where are you[?]” and “you [sic] supposed to be here today at 0800hrs, your sick leave request 
will not be approved…” ECF No. 94-5 at 134.                                
she received a text message telling her to come into work. DSUMF 64. Nearly a month and a 
half later, in January 2018, Quintana again received a text message instructing her to report to 
work. DSUMF 68.                                                            
    The content of the communications do not aid Quintana, either. They are “mere offensive 

utterances” at the very most, if even that. Torres-Santiago, 617 F. Supp.2d at 36. Again, Quintana 
received an e-mail recommending she apply for an open position at a different Army base, a 
report-to-work text message on the day of an unexcused absence, and an incident in which 
Quintana was mistakenly asked to report to work while on leave and then told to go home once 

she arrived. A reasonable trier of fact could not find that these incidents are enough to “alter the 
conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment.’” White, 221 
F.3d at 259. A hostile work environment claim must therefore fail. Id.     

    Besides, the Army has entered evidence into the record articulating legitimate, non-
discriminatory reasons for these three incidents, which remain uncontested: (1) Carter said he 
forwarded the posting because Quintana had expressed numerous times she wanted to leave 
Fort Buchanan and that she was displeased with her current work, DSUMF 47; (2) Quintana was 

absent from work and was not on preapproved leave nor had notified Scalf she was sick, 
DSUMFs 64-67; and, (3) Scalf believed, erroneously, that Quintana’s leave had concluded on 
January 3 because of a mix-up with the leave documents, DSUMFs 68, 69 and 71. She has thus 

failed to demonstrate “through submissions of evidentiary quality that a trial worthy issue 
persists.” Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 108 (1st Cir. 2006).    
    For the foregoing reasons, “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the 
movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). See also Sands, 212 F.3d 
at  660.  Quintana’s  Title  VII  hostile  work  environment  claims  are  DISMISSED  WITH 
PREJUDICE.                                                                 

 3.  Retaliation                                                          
    The Army finally moves for summary judgment dismissing Quintana’s claims that she 
was subjected to a fabricated investigation and transferred to a less desirable position as a 
retaliatory measure in violation of Title VII and the FLSA for having filed a discrimination 

complaint with the EEOC alleging discrimination on the basis of her national origin. ECF 1 at 
13-14. Quintana indeed filed a national origin discrimination complaint with the EEOC in 2014, 
that was dismissed in July of 2017. DSUMFs 2 and 5.                        

    A.  FLSA Retaliation                                                  
    Right off the bat, the Court must do away with Quintana’s FLSA retaliation claim. “The 
FLSA anti-retaliation provision protects an employee's lawful efforts to secure rights afforded 
by the FLSA.” Claudio-Gotay v. Becton Dickinson Caribe, Ltd, 375 F.3d 99, 103 (1st Cir. 2004). The 

FLSA establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor standards 
affecting full-time and part-time workers in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local 
governments. See generally U.S. Department of Labor, Handy Reference Guide to the Fair Labor 

Standards Act. It does not, however, cover discrimination on the basis of national origin. See id. 
Because Quintana’s 2014 EEOC complaint was premised on national origin discrimination, she 
cannot pursue a claim of FLSA retaliation here. See Claudio-Gotay, 375 F.3d at 103. Quintana’s 
FLSA retaliation claim is thus DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.                   
    B.  Title VII Retaliation                                             
    Now, the Court turns to Quintana’s Title VII discrimination claims.   

    “Title VII's antiretaliation provision forbids employer actions that discriminate against 
an employee … because [she] has opposed a practice that Title VII forbids or has made a charge, 
testified, assisted, or participated in a Title VII investigation, proceeding, or hearing.” Burlington 
N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 59 (2006) (cleaned up). A plaintiff may prove that an 

employer took an action with retaliatory intent through direct evidence or through the familiar 
McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Strothers v. City of Laurel, Maryland, 895 F.3d 
317, 327 (4th Cir. 2018). Here, Quintana has not supplied any direct evidence of retaliatory 

animus, so her claim must be evaluated through the lenses of McDonnell Douglas-tinted glasses.  
     Per the burden-shifting framework, “in order to establish a prima facie case of retaliation, 
[Quintana] must show that (1) she engaged in protected conduct; (2) she was subjected to an 
adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse employment action is causally linked to the 

protected conduct.” Rivera-Rivera v. Medina & Medina, Inc., 898 F.3d 77, 94 (1st Cir. 2018). After 
the prima facie showing is made, the burden then shifts to the employer to show that its 
purportedly retaliatory action was in fact the result of a legitimate non-retaliatory reason. See 

Thermo King, 585 F.3d at 447-48. If the employer makes this showing, the burden shifts back to 
the plaintiff to rebut the employer's evidence by demonstrating that the employer's purported 
nonretaliatory reasons were not its true reasons, but rather a pretext for discrimination. Id.  
    Here, the Court harbors no doubt that Quintana engaged in protected conduct (by filing 
the 2014 EEOC charge) and will assume without deciding, only for argument purposes, that she 

was subjected to adverse employment actions. The Court will thus focus its analysis on whether 
“the adverse employment action is causally linked to the protected conduct.” Id. Each alleged 
retaliatory adverse action – namely, two investigations and a transfer, will be addressed below.  
    With respect to these alleged actions, Quintana can establish a causal connection, as 

required to build a prima facie case of retaliation, either                
    (1)  indirectly,  by  showing  that  the  protected  activity  was  followed  closely 
    by retaliatory treatment,  or  through  other  circumstantial  evidence  such  as 
    disparate treatment of fellow employees who engaged in similar conduct; or (2) 
    directly, through evidence of retaliatory animus directed against the plaintiff by 
    the defendant. A causal connection between a protected action and an adverse 
    employment  decision,  necessary  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case 
    of Title VII retaliation,  may  be  established  by  the  timing  of  the  adverse 
    employment decision, by evidence that the employer departed from its normal 
    practices, or by evidence that the employer took steps to conceal the reason for its 
    adverse employment action.                                            

Ashworth, Bateman, et al., 21A FEDERAL PROCEDURE § 50:967 (L. Ed.).        
      i. The Investigations                                               
    Following allegations of mismanagement and poor work conditions, the 81st Regional 
Support Command (“the 81st Command”), based in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, initiated an 
investigation into Fort Buchanan’s FMWR Division in May of 2016. DSUMF 7.  Dieppa, along 
with the FMWR supervisory chain, was one of the subjects of that investigation. DSUMF 8. 
Upon completion of the investigation, the investigating officer found that Dieppa did “not 
always treat subordinates with dignity and respect or foster a healthy command climate” and 
that her “authoritative and brash leadership style [had] fostered a toxic work environment.” 

DSUMFs 11 and 12 (quoting ECF No. 94-3 at 13). A follow-up investigation was conducted 
afterwards. DSUMFs 15 and 16.                                              
    The  Army  posits  that  Quintana  cannot  demonstrate  that  the  investigations  were 
motivated by a retaliatory animus. Quintana has not made an evidentiary showing in response 

that could lead a reasonable trier of fact to infer a prima facie causal connection between the 
EEOC 2014 complaint and the 2016-2017 investigations. The Army, on the other hand, has 
pointed to record materials demonstrating that such a showing is unattainable for Quintana.  

    The investigations were initiated and conducted by the 81st Command, based in Fort 
Jackson, South Carolina – not by Fort Buchannan personnel. DSUMF 7; ECF No. 94-3 at 2-3. 
Quintana has not demonstrated that the officers and officials of the 81st Command were aware 
of her previous protected activity. One cannot have been motivated to retaliate “by something 

[one] was unaware of.” Echevarria v. AstraZeneca, LP, 133 F. Supp. 3d 372, 402 (D.P.R. 2015), aff'd 
sub nom. Echevarria v. AstraZeneca Pharm. LP, 856 F.3d 119 (1st Cir. 2017) (citing Ameen v. Amphenol 
Printed Circuits, Inc., 777 F.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir.2015)). The timing of the investigations in relation 
to the protected activity is not necessarily suspect,21 there is no evidence that the Army departed 
from  its  normal  practices,  or  that  the  employer  took  steps  to  conceal  the  reason  for  the 
investigations (instead, the Army’s stated reasons for the investigation were set forth in various 
memoranda). 21A FEDERAL PROCEDURE § 50:967.                                

    Furthermore,  there  is  no  showing  that  Quintana  was  treated  disparately  to  fellow 
employees by being subjected to an investigation. See id. On the contrary, Quintana was 
investigated along with two others in the FMWR supervisory chain.22 DSUMF 8; ECF No. 94-3 
at 2-3. And the investigation returned negative results against another supervisor in the FMWR 

division, too. ECF No. 94-3 at 11-12. Quintana has not met her burden per the McDonnell Douglas 
burden-shifting framework – a prima facie case of retaliation therefore cannot be established.  See 
Rivera-Rivera, 898 F.3d at 94. Plus, it is well settled that the mere fact of engaging in protected 

activity does not excuse an employee from having to follow the rules and fulfill their duties, nor 
does it insulate them from warranted employer action and discipline. See e.g. Planadeball v. 
Wyndham Vacation Resorts, Inc., 793 F.3d 169, 179 (1st Cir. 2015).         


21 Even if it was, it would not be enough. Temporal proximity, by itself, cannot show retaliatory motive. See Skalsky 
v. Independent School Dist. No. 743, 772 F.3d 1126 (8th Cir. 2014). “Although temporal proximity itself is insufficient 
to establish a causal connection between the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action, as 
required to demonstrate a prima facie claim of Title VII retaliation, a temporal connection between the protected 
activity and the alleged adverse employment action coupled with other indicia of retaliatory conduct may be 
sufficient to support a finding of a causal connection.” 21A FEDERAL PROCEDURE § 50:967 (citing Randolph v. Ohio 
Dept. of Youth Services, 453 F.3d 724 (6th Cir. 2006)).                    
22 The Army’s actions after the conclusion of the investigation also speak against Quintana’s position that the 
investigation was retaliatory. The Commanding General at Fort Jackson forwarded the findings of the first 
investigation to the Garrison Commander at Fort Buchanan, who requested a second, follow-up investigation into 
Quintana’s treatment of her subordinates. DSUMFs 13, 15 and 16. That follow-up investigation began in late August 
of 2016 and concluded a little over a moth later, in early October. DSUMF 15. Both investigations, though 
independent, yielded similar results.                                      
    Even  if  Quintana  had  established  a  prima  facie  retaliation  case,  her  claim  would 
nevertheless fail in the subsequent steps of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. 
To be sure, the Army provided a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for the investigation – that is, 
responding to allegations of mismanagement levied against the FMWR supervisory chain. 

DSUMF 7; See also Thermo King, 585 F.3d at 447-48. Quintana did not rebut the Army's evidence 
by demonstrating that the employer's purported nonretaliatory reasons for the investigation 
were not its true reasons, but rather a pretext for discrimination. Id. No such attempt was even 
made.  “In  a  case  where  the  first  two  steps  of  the McDonnell Douglas pavane  have  been 

satisfactorily choreographed, a plaintiff must offer some minimally sufficient evidence, direct 
or indirect, both of pretext and of the employer's discriminatory animus to prevail in the face of 
a properly drawn Rule 56 motion.” Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825.                

      ii. The Transfer                                                    
    Quintana was involuntary transferred to a less desirable position in November 2017. 
DSUMFs 31, 32 36. She alleges that the transfer was a retaliatory measure. The Army maintains 
that Quintana cannot show that the transfer was in retaliation for her previous protected 

conduct in 2014. Indeed, the transfer is even further removed than the investigation, timewise, 
from the protected conduct. See 21A FEDERAL PROCEDURE § 50:967.            
    Even if Quintana built a prima facie case of retaliation (she doesn’t), her retaliation claim 

pertaining to the transfer would nonetheless fail because the Army provided a legitimate non-
retaliatory  reason  for  the  transfer  which  she  has  failed  to  rebut  by  establishing  that  the 
purported reason was a pretext to hide a retaliatory animus. See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825.  
    The Court has already discussed Quintana’s transfer at length. See supra at 22-23, 24-27 
There, the Court explained that the Army had proffered a non-discriminatory justification for 

the transfer, and Quintana had failed to establish that the proffered reason was a pretext. Id. 
Quintana’s arguments for pretext here are nearly identical to the ones discussed above. Id. There 
is no reason to go into much further detail, save to say that Quintana fares even worse here 
because the Court has already found that the investigations were not retaliatory. Thus, Quintana 

fails to meet her burden in the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. See Strothers, 895 
F.3d at 327.                                                               
    The Court reminds the reader that Quintana needed to “elucidate specific facts which 

would enable a jury to find that the reason given is not only a sham, but a sham intended to 
cover up the employer’s real motive,” Santangelo, 785 F.3d at 70, or proffer record material that 
evince “such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in 
the employer’s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could 

rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the 
asserted non-[retaliatory] reasons.” Gómez González, 626 F.3d at 662-663. Quintana has not come 
even close to meeting that burden here. Quintana has thus failed to demonstrate “through 

submissions of evidentiary quality that a trial worthy issue persists.” Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 
F.3d 94, 108 (1st Cir. 2006). See also Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825 (failure to provide evidence of pretext 
at summary judgment stage is fatal).                                       
    For all the foregoing reasons, Quintana’s Title VII retaliation claims are DISMISSED 
WITH PREJUDICE.                                                            

 VI. Conclusion                                                           
    In accordance with the reasons stated above, the Court GRANTS the Army’s motion for 
summary  judgment  (ECF  No.  93).  All  of  Quintana’s  pending  claims  are  accordingly 
DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. Judgment shall be entered accordingly.           

    SO ORDERED.

FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO                          

CARMEN QUINTANA-DIEPPA,                                                   

     Plaintiff,                                                           

     v.                                                                   
                                       Civil No. 19-1277 (ADC)            
DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY,                                                   

     Defendants.                                                          

                         OPINION & ORDER                                  
    Defendant Mark T. Esper, Secretary of the Department of the Army (“defendants”) filed 
a motion for partial dismissal of the complaint. ECF Nos. 7, 8. Plaintiff Carmen Quintana-Dieppa 
(“plaintiff”) opposed the motion. ECF No. 14. Defendant replied. ECF No. 20. For the following 
reasons, the motion for partial dismissal is GRANTED. ECF Nos. 7, 8.       
 I.   Background                                                          
    Plaintiff, a 62-year-old female, began working for the United States Department of the 
Army in 1988. ECF No. 1 at 6. At all relevant times, she was employed as a Child and Youth 
Services (“CYS”) Coordinator (NF-1701-04) by the Directorate of Family and Morale, Welfare 
and  Recreation  (“FMWR”),  a  Non-Appropriated  Funds  (“NAF”)  Instrumentality  at  Fort 
Buchanan. Id. at 7. Plaintiff reported to agency officials Tod Scalf, Director of FMWR at Fort 
Buchanan, and Daniel Carter, Acting Program Director, both her immediate supervisors. Id. at 
7-8. At some point, plaintiff complained about being subjected to hostile work environment by 
Scalf and Williams Leyh1, and to workplace discrimination and/or harassment by Carter. Id. On 
September 14, 2014, plaintiff filed a complaint with the EEOC against defendants, alleging 
discrimination because of her national origin2. Id. at 13. Plaintiff points to various incidents 
between  2016  and  2017,  including  Carter’s  purported  refusal  to  promote  her  to  a  CYS 

Coordinator NF-05 position, poor performance reviews in 2017, and failure to review her 
performance during some periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Id. at 8.         
    On November 17, 2017, plaintiff received notice of removal from her position as CYS 
Coordinator via a letter dated November 16, 2017 and signed by Scalf. ECF No. 1 at 1, 2, 9. That 

day, she was reassigned to a newly created position as Project Manager (NF-04) - a de facto 
demotion to a non-supervisory position - and immediately placed on administrative leave. Id. 
Plaintiff was asked to return her office keys and told to go home. Id. According to the complaint, 

the reassignment was based on the result of an AR 15-6 investigation conducted from August 
to October 2016 regarding violations to the Army Regulation 600-20, section 2-1’s chain of 
command policies.3 Id. at 1-4, 7-9, 14. Plaintiff contends that the AR 15-6 investigation was a 
pretext for discrimination based on her age, race and gender, and an act of retaliation because 

of her 2014 EEOC complaint. Id. Plaintiff further avers that defendants did not provide the 
required 14-day notification prior to her reassignment in violation of agency regulations, nor 


1 Plaintiff describes Leyh as a GS-14 Civilian at Fort Buchanan. ECF No. 1 at 6.  
2 Plaintiff also alleges that her EEOC complaint was based on race discrimination. ECF No. 1 at 7. At this juncture, 
the Court need not delve into the specific contents of her EEOC complaints.  
3 On November 17, 2017, defendants also provided plaintiff with a copy of the report of the AR 15-6 investigation 
results. ECF No. 1 at 2.                                                   
allowed  plaintiff  to  file  a  rebuttal,  oppose,  or  appeal  the  investigation  results  or  her 
reassignment, all in violation of her due process rights. Id. at 1, 2, 9, 10. She also alleges that 
defendants’ actions were motivated by a discriminatory animus because of her age and gender, 
and indeed she was replaced by a non-Hispanic Caucasian individual under 40. Id. at 9, 12, 15.  

    On or around November 20, 2017, while on approved sick leave, plaintiff received a text 
message from Scalf inquiring where she was, noting she was supposed to be at work at 8:00am. 
She was also warned that her sick leave would not be approved, and that she would be charged 
annual leave. ECF No. 1 at 9. On January 4, 2018, although defendant was on approved annual 

leave until January 5, 2018, Scalf sent her another text message stating that her leave had ended 
and requesting that she report for duty. Id.                               
    On January 29, 2018, plaintiff filed another EEOC complaint alleging race, gender, and 

age discrimination, and retaliation based on her previous protected activity. ECF No. 1 at 4. She 
argued that the de facto demotion to a non-supervisory position affected her promotions, time 
and attendance, evaluations, terms and conditions of federal employment. Id. The EEOC issued 
its decision on January 9, 2019. Id. at 1.                                 

    Plaintiff now alleges due process violations under the Fifth Amendment, deprivation of 
rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, violation of the Equal Pay Act (“EPA”), 29 U.S.C. §206(d), 
retaliation, and gender and age discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 

(“Title VII”),  42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq., and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), 
29 U.S.C. §621 et seq., respectively. ECF. No. 1 at 10-15. She further contends that defendants 
violated the EPA when management officials engaged in sex-based discrimination, refused to 
promote her, and unlawfully removed her from her supervisory role. Id. at 11.  
    In its motion for partial dismissal, defendants argue that this Court lacks subject matter 
jurisdiction as to plaintiff’s Fifth Amendment, §1983, and EPA claims. Namely, defendants posit 

that the Department of the Army has not waived its sovereign immunity, its employees acted 
under the color of federal law and thus, are not subject to §1983 liability. Moreover, they proffer 
that her EPA claims exceed the statute’s monetary limits depriving this Court of jurisdiction. 
Even so, they argue that plaintiff fails to show any entitlement to relief under the EPA, which 

addresses  wage  disparities.  Lastly,  defendants  contend  that  plaintiff’s  constitutional  and 
discrimination claims are preempted by the Civil Service Reform Act (“CSRA”), 5 U.S.C. §101 et 
seq., Title VII and the ADEA. ECF No. 10 at 5-11.                          

    Plaintiff opposed, arguing that defendants’ motion is “premature” and “without merits”. 
ECF No. 14 at 1. According to plaintiff, construing the allegations of the complaint in her favor 
and accepting all factual allegations as true, she sets forth valid and independent discrimination 
and due process claims which are not preempted by the CSRA, Title VII and the ADEA. Id. She 

further argues that the complaint’s factual underpinnings support a claim under the EPA. Id.  
    In their reply, defendants reiterate that plaintiff fails to rebut the fact that, despite the 
complaint’s factual allegations, her Fifth Amendment and §1983 claims are preempted by the 

CSRA, Title VII and the ADEA. ECF No. 20. They also point to plaintiff’s failure to cite any legal 
support showing that this Court retains jurisdiction over her EPA claims.  Id.  
 II.  Standard of Review                                                  
    “When a court is confronted with motions to dismiss under both Rules 12(b)(1) and 
12(b)(6), it ordinarily ought to decide the former before broaching the latter.” González v. Otero, 
172 F. Supp. 3d 477, 495 (D.P.R. 2016) (citing Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 285 F.3d 142, 149 

(1st Cir. 2002)). “After all, if the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, assessment of the merits 
becomes a matter of purely academic interest.” Id.                         
    Under Rule 12(b)(1), a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for lack of subject-
matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). When reviewing a complaint under Rule 12(b)(1), 

courts “construe the Complaint liberally and treat all well-pleaded facts as true, according the 
plaintiff[s] the benefit of all reasonable inferences.” Town of Barnstable v. O’Connor, 786 F.3d 130, 
138 (1st Cir. 2015) (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A 

complaint, so construed, must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) if the Court lacks subject-matter 
jurisdiction to adjudicate its claims.                                     
    Courts also favorably construe a complaint when considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Rodríguez-Reyes v. Molina-

Rodríguez, 711 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2013). “While detailed factual allegations are not necessary to 
survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint nonetheless must contain 
more than a rote recital of the elements of a cause of action” and “must contain sufficient factual 

matter to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. (additional citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted) (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678–79 (2009)). “If the factual 
allegations in the complaint are too meager, vague, or conclusory to remove the possibility of 
relief from the realm of mere conjecture, the complaint is open to dismissal.” S.E.C. v. Tambone, 
597 F.3d 436, 442 (1st Cir. 2010) (en banc).                               
III.  Analysis                                                             

    A. Plaintiff’s § 1983 claims fail                                     
    It is well settled that under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff can bring a “private right of action 
against  a  person  who,  under  color  of  state  law,  deprives  another  of  rights  secured  by  the 
Constitution or by federal law.”4 Santiago v. Puerto Rico, 655 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing 

Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of HUD, 421 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005)); see also Natal-Rosario v. Puerto 
Rico Police Dept., 639 F. Supp. 2d 174, 180 (D.P.R. 2009). However, it cannot form the basis of an 
action against individuals acting under color of federal law or against a federal agency. Rogers 

v. Vicuna, 264 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2001). There is no dispute that plaintiff’s allegations hinge on 
defendants’ actions under color of federal law. ECF No. 1 at 2-3. As such, plaintiff’s claims under 
§ 1983 necessarily fail.                                                   
    Construing the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the Court may infer that 

she constructively argues a Bivens claim arising out of defendants’ purported violations of her 
due process rights. ECF No. 1 at 9-10. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that she was not provided 
with adequate procedural due process as outlined in federal regulations, including advance 


4 The First Circuit noted that section 1983’s “under color of state law” requirement is the functional equivalent of 
the Fourteenth Amendment's “state action” requirement. Santiago v. Puerto Rico, 655 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir. 2011). 
notice about her reassignment, as well as the right of rebuttal and to appeal both the results of 
the AR 15-6 investigation and the reassignment. See ECF No. 1.             
    The  Bivens  doctrine  allows  constitutional  claims  against  federal  officials,  in  their 
individual capacities, for actions taken under color of federal law.  McCloskey v. Mueller, 446 F.3d 

262, 271-272 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of 
Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 389 (1971)); see also Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000). 
Nonetheless, it is well settled that a Bivens action will not lie against an agency of the federal 
government. Riley, 209 F.3d at 28 (citing FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 486 (1994)). It “can only be 

brought against federal officials in their individual capacities. Even then, the plaintiff must state 
a claim for direct rather than vicarious liability; respondeat superior is not a viable theory of 
Bivens liability.” Riley, 209 F.3d at 28 (collection of cases); see also Tapia-Tapia v. Potter, 322 F.3d 

742, 746 (1st Cir. 2003) (finding that appellant did not have a viable Bivens claim against the 
Postmaster General since he was sued only in his official capacity and Bivens suits only can be 
brought against federal officers in their individual capacities).          
    Plaintiff’s complaint fails to state and assert that any of the defendants are sued in their 

individual capacity. In fact, plaintiff’s allegations consistently refer to defendants acting in their 
official capacities, “under color of federal law” and within the “course and scope of their 
employment”. See ECF No. 1 at 6, 10-11. Consequently, any possible Bivens claim fails. Even if 

plaintiff’s complaint could somehow be interpreted to include claims against defendants in their 
individual capacity, Bivens’ applicability in this case is barred on other grounds.  
    The Supreme Court held that Bivens claims should be precluded when “Congress has 
provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery 
directly under the Constitution and viewed as equally effective.” Herbst v. United States Postal 
Serv., 953 F. Supp. 2d 463, 467 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing Carlson v. Green 446 U.S. 14, 18 (1980)). 

Indeed, “one of the special factors that counsels hesitation in permitting a Bivens remedy is the 
‘comprehensiveness of available statutory schemes’ to remedy a plaintiff’s injury.” Id. (citing 
Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559, 573 (2d Cir. 2009)).                       
    Such  is  the  case  with  the  CSRA,  which  “established  a  comprehensive  system  for 

reviewing personnel action taken against federal employees.” Elgin v. Dep't of the Treasury, 567 
U.S. 1, 5 (2012) (citing United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 455 (1988)). “This comprehensive 
scheme supersedes any independent judicial remedy.” Hernández v. Department of the Army, 927 

F. Supp. 570, 574 (D.P.R. 1996). Certainly, “there is no basis for extending the Bivens doctrine to 
claims alleging arbitrary or discriminatory treatment in those precincts of the federal workplace 
patrolled by the CSRA and Title VII.” González v. Vélez, 864 F.3d 45, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2017).  
    As defendants correctly point out, plaintiff’s claims for alleged violations of her due 

process, retaliation, and discrimination are preempted by the CSRA, Title VII and the ADEA.  
    B.  Plaintiff’s due process, retaliation, and discrimination claims are preempted by the 
      CSRA, Title VII and ADEA                                            

    Plaintiff contends that her supervisors investigated and reassigned her, disregarding her 
due process rights, and discriminated against her because of her race, gender and age, and in 
retaliation for prior protected activity. It is well settled that “[t]he CSRA preempts challenges to 
personnel actions brought under federal law.”5 Berríos v. Department of Army, 884 F.2d 28, 30 (1st 
Cir. 1989). In Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.S. 367 (1983), the United States Supreme Court addressed 
whether a federal employee could recover damages for defamation and violation of his First 

Amendment  constitutional  rights.  The  Court  declined  to  create  a  constitutional  claim  for 
damages  among  federal  employees  given  the  existing  CSRA’s  “elaborate  remedial 
system...constructed step by step, with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations.” 
González v. Otero, 172 F. Supp. 3d 477, 504, 2016 (citing Bush, 462 U.S. at 388-390). Accordingly, 

it held that a plaintiff seeking to recover  damages for  unconstitutional actions in federal 
personnel decisions is limited to the remedial scheme established by the CSRA. Id.; see also 
Berríos, 884 F.2d at 30-31. On this point, the Court emphasized:           

    Federal civil servants are now protected by an elaborate comprehensive scheme 
    that  encompasses  substantive  provisions  forbidding  arbitrary  action  by 
    supervisors and procedures -- administrative and judicial -- by which improper 
    action may be redressed. They apply to a multitude of personnel decisions that are 
    made daily by federal agencies. Constitutional challenges to agency action . . . are 
    fully cognizable within this system.                                  

Bush, 462 U.S. at 385-86. The “[e]xclusivity of the remedial scheme provided by the CSRA is 
necessary to effectuate the statutory design, ‘balancing the legitimate interests of the various 
categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient regulation.’” Desmond v. 
Department of Defense, No. 92-2201, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 5195, *8 (1st Cir. Mar. 19, 1993) (citing 

5 The CSRA provides NAF employees their exclusive remedy for federal employment personnel actions. Hernández 
v. Department of the Army, 927 F. Supp. 570, 575 (D.P.R. 1996).            
Fausto, 484 U.S. 439). To that end, the CSRA “prescribes in great detail the protections and 
remedies applicable to such action, including the availability of administrative and judicial 
review.” Fausto, 484 U.S. at 443. This Circuit, closely following Bush, has refused to entertain 
constitutional claims by federal employees outside the scope of the CSRA. Otero, 172 F. Supp. at 

504; Roth v. United States, 952 F.2d 611 (1st Cir. 1991); Berríos, 884 F. 2d at 31. In so doing, the 
Court noted that “[e]ngrafting new causes of action on an ad hoc basis would create a patchwork 
that perpetuates the same infirmities that the CSRA was designed to avoid.” González, 864 F.3d 
at 55.                                                                     

    The CSRA permits federal employees to challenge “prohibited personnel practices” by 
their supervisors, including unconstitutional personnel actions. Otero, 172 F. Supp. 3d at 504 
(citing  5  U.S.C.  §  2302).  The  definition  of  “personnel  actions”  includes  promotions, 

reassignments,  performance  evaluations,  disciplinary  or  corrective  actions,  or  decisions 
concerning pay, benefits, or awards, among others. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(2)(A).6 Bolivar v. Director of 
the FBI, 846 F. Supp. 163, 168 (D.P.R. 1994); see Rivera-Avilés v. United States DOJ, No. 12-1063, 
2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127744, *17 (D.P.R. Sept. 5, 2013) (finding that defendants’ decision to 

reassign plaintiff is a personnel action that must also be addressed under the CSRA). 


6 The CSRA defines “personnel action” to include “a detail, transfer, or reassignment” and “any other significant 
change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.” 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a) (2009). It also proscribes employees 
from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin as prohibited under Title VII and on the 
basis of age as prohibited under the ADEA. 5 U.S.C. §2302(b)(1)(a) & (b). The CSRA further prohibits employees 
from taking personnel action with respect to an employee for exercising their right to file a complaint or grievance 
as allowed by law. Id. at §2302(b)(8) & (9).                               
    The actions challenged via plaintiff’s constitutional claims are clearly “personnel actions” 
within  the  meaning  of  the  CSRA.  She  asserts  due  process  violations  via  the  improper 
implementation of personnel policy, namely the lack of notification prior to her reassignment, 
the deprivation of her right to rebut the investigation findings, and to appeal the investigation 

results. She further objects to the reassignment to a new position, alleged denial of a promotion, 
and  the  rating  of  various  performance  evaluations.  As  in  Berríos,  “given  that  plaintiff’s 
constitutional claims amount to a federal law challenge to an adverse personnel action, they are 
preempted by the CSRA consistent with the reasoning of Bush and Fausto.” Berríos, 884 F.2d at 

31.                                                                        
    The CSRA and Title VII, “with their regulatory accoutrements, form a comprehensive 
remedial network fully capable of protecting federal employees against acts of discrimination 

in the workplace”, such as the ones alleged by plaintiff. González, 864 F.3d at 54. Specifically, 
Title VII preempts constitutional claims flowing from alleged employment discrimination. 
Coulibaly v. Kerry, 213 F. Supp. 3d 93, 144, 2016 (citing Elgin, 567 U.S. 1, and Fausto, 484 U.S. at 
455); see also Rivera-Rosario v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 151 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 1998) (finding that 

“where the gravamen of the complaint is Title VII discrimination, the only remedy available is 
under Title VII”); Díaz-Romero v. Ashcroft, 472 F.Supp. 2d 156, 161 (D.P.R. 2007) (finding that 
Title VII remedies for federal employees are exclusive). In the same fashion, the ADEA provides 

the exclusive federal remedy for age discrimination in employment, and thus preempts judicial 
remedies  based  directly  on  the  Constitution  for  claims  of  age  discrimination  in  federal 
employment. Tapia-Tapia v. Potter, 322 F.3d at 745; Castro v. United States, 584 F. Supp. 252, 259, 
1984. Since plaintiff’s constitutional and discrimination claims fall squarely under the CSRA, 
Title VII and the ADEA’s purview, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction as to plaintiff’s 
Fifth Amendment and §1983 claims, which are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.      

    C. EPA Claims                                                         
    Defendants’ request for dismissal as to plaintiff’s EPA claims is twofold; they allege lack 
of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. ECF No. 8.                   
    As to the jurisdictional matter, it is well established that EPA claims brought to the district 

courts must satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491. Hunter v. 
Rice, 480 F. Supp. 2d 125, 131 (D.D.C. 2007). Section 1346(a)(2), known as the “Little Tucker Act”, 
confers concurrent jurisdiction in district court and the Claims Court for civil actions against the 

United States not exceeding $10,000 in amount. Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2)); see also Iyer v. 
Everson, 382 F. Supp. 2d 749, 759 (E.D. Penn. 2005). The Court of Federal Claims, however, has 
exclusive jurisdiction over monetary claims under EPA exceeding $10,000. Hunter, 480 F. Supp. 
2d at 131 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1491). Since plaintiff seeks “damages far in excess of this statutory 

limit, jurisdiction to hear this claim is not vested within this court.” Díaz v. McHugh, No. 08-1767 
(GAG), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119031, *3 (D.P.R. Dec. 22, 2009) (citing Barnes v. Levitt, 118 F.3d 
404, 410 (5th Cir. 1997)); see also Iyer, 382 F. Supp. 2d at 759 (collection of cases). Accordingly, 

dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is proper.                              
    Even if this Court had jurisdiction, plaintiff fails to state a valid claim under the EPA. In 
the complaint, plaintiff proffers that defendants violated the EPA “when management officials 
engaged in sex-based discrimination, when [they]: (1) refused to promote the plaintiff and (2) 
unlawfully removed her from her supervisory role and placed her in a clerical position.” ECF 

No. 1 at 11. She also contends that the terms and conditions of her employment, including 
promotions, were adversely affected by defendants’ actions. Id. There are, however, no factual 
allegations regarding unequal wages based on her gender, and no mention of any alleged wage 
disparities in any context.                                                

    Under the EPA, a plaintiff must first establish that “the employer paid different wages to 
an employee of the opposite sex for substantially equal work.” Rodríguez v. SmithKline Beecham 
Pharm., P.R., Inc., 62 F. Supp. 2d 374, 382 (D.P.R. 1999) (citing Byrd v. Ronayne, 61 F.3d 1026, 1033 

(1st Cir. 1995). This requires proving that the employer pays different wages to employees of 
the opposite sex, who perform equal work on jobs requiring equal skill, effort, responsibility, 
and performed under similar working conditions. Id. (citations omitted). Plaintiff does not 
proffer wage disparity between herself and her supervisors or make any showing under the 

required EPA standard to show a plausible entitlement to relief. Instead, her claims are based 
on alleged discriminatory actions based on her gender, which are under the sole purview of 
Title VII and the CSRA. Accordingly, plaintiff’s EPA claims are DISMISSED with prejudice.  
    IV.  Conclusion                                                       
    Defendants’ motion for partial dismissal is GRANTED. ECF Nos. 7, 8. Plaintiff’s claims 
of due process under the Fifth Amendment, under the EPA and §1983 are DISMISSED WITH 
PREJUDICE. Clerk of Court is to enter partial judgment accordingly.        

    SO ORDERED.
