reason_for_appeal: '=== Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, et al. (State of Maine officials and entities)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in holding that the Act was preempted by federal law (FECA) as to federal elections, contending that the Act should be interpreted not to apply to federal elections rather than being preempted.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court applied the wrong level of constitutional scrutiny to the Act, arguing that ''exacting scrutiny'' (or ''closely drawn'' scrutiny) should apply to the Act''s restrictions on contributions and expenditures, rather than strict scrutiny.

  3. Appellants argued that the district court erred in failing to recognize all of Maine''s proposed compelling interests, including the interest in limiting both actual and apparent foreign government influence in state candidate and referenda elections.

  4. Appellants contended that the district court erred in finding that the Act was not narrowly tailored to Maine''s compelling interests, specifically defending the 5% foreign ownership threshold and the ''actual participation'' definition as sufficiently tailored.

  5. Appellants argued that the district court erred in finding the Act facially invalid, asserting that the Act''s unconstitutional applications did not substantially outweigh its plainly legitimate sweep.

  6. Appellants contended that the district court''s preliminary injunction was overly broad, including by enjoining provisions such as the disclaimer requirement (subsection 6) without analyzing their constitutionality.

  7. Appellants argued that the district court abused its discretion by reserving the question of severability and not analyzing whether the Act''s definitions or provisions could be severed under Maine law.'
