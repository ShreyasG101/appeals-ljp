outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Capitol Records, LLC, et al. (Plaintiffs/Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in finding that they had waived the argument under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., that Vimeo’s encouragement of users to make infringing lip-dub videos may constitute a form of ''right and ability to control'' infringement, thus risking forfeiture of the safe harbor provided by the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. § 512(c).

  2. Plaintiffs contended that their Grokster-based argument regarding inducement to infringe was in fact pressed throughout their opening brief and was not waived.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the appellate court should remove from its prior opinion a footnote discussing whether the Grokster-based argument, even if waived in the Second Circuit, was adequately preserved for review by the Supreme Court.'
