outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Commonwealth defendants (Massachusetts Attorney General, eleven district attorneys, administrator of the state trial court, and interim superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the plaintiffs'' claims were barred by the Eleventh Amendment, which prohibits suits in federal court against a state by its own citizens.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in allowing plaintiffs'' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief (other than the return of forfeited property) to proceed under the Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity.

  3. Appellant asserted that the relief sought by plaintiffs, including notice, accounting, and additional procedural protections in Rule 60(b) proceedings, was not prospective relief and therefore not permitted under Ex parte Young.

  4. Appellant argued that the state officials sued lacked the authority to enforce or change the state court procedures that plaintiffs sought to challenge, and thus could not be proper defendants under Ex parte Young.'
