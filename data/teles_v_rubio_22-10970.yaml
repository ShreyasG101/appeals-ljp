outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Eduardo Teles de Menezes and Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Menezes (Plaintiffs, Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the District Court erred in dismissing their complaint under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability because their challenge was to the reclassification of a visa petition, not to a consular officer''s denial of a visa.

  2. Appellants contended that the reclassification of Eduardo''s visa petition from the F2A category to the F1 category, following Eduardo''s naturalization, violated the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) because Carlos should have been treated as under 21 years of age for purposes of visa classification.

  3. Appellants argued that, under the CSPA, Carlos remained ''under twenty-one years of age'' on the date of Eduardo''s naturalization and therefore qualified as an immediate relative, making the reclassification to the F1 category unlawful.

  4. Appellants asserted that the Department of State''s action, as indicated by the March 4 Email, constituted final agency action that was contrary to law and violated the Administrative Procedure Act.

  5. Appellants also asserted a claim under the Due Process Clause, alleging a violation of their constitutional rights.'
