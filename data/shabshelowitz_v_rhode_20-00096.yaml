outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Harlan Shabshelowitz''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the defendants failed to establish the ''final judgment'' element of Rhode Island collateral estoppel law, contending that there was no final judgment on the merits in the prior state court proceedings.

  2. Appellant contended that he was deprived of a full and fair opportunity to litigate in state court because appellate review in the Rhode Island Supreme Court was unavailable.'
