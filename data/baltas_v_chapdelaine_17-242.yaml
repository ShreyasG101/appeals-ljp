reason_for_appeal: '=== Joe Baltas, Jason Goode, Kenyon L. Joseph Pellot-Castellano, Richard Rice, Yardley Davis, Philip Rivera, Noah Gladding, Peter Tarasco, Jose Ortiz (Plaintiffs-Appellants)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their Eighth Amendment claims, contending that the isolation and hygienic conditions in Q-Pod constituted cruel and unusual punishment.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claims, asserting that their confinement in Q-Pod imposed atypical and significant hardships and violated a state-created liberty interest without due process.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their First Amendment free exercise claims, asserting that Defendants denied them access to religious services, including Native American sweat lodge and smudging practices, thereby burdening their sincerely held religious beliefs.

  4. Plaintiffs contended that the district court erred in granting Defendants qualified immunity, arguing that the rights at issue were clearly established at the time of the alleged conduct.

  5. Plaintiffs objected to the district court''s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over their state-law claims after dismissing the federal claims.'
