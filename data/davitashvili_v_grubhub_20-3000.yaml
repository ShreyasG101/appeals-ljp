outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Grubhub Inc., Postmates Inc., and Uber Technologies, Inc.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Defendants argued that the district court erred in denying their motion to compel arbitration because Plaintiffs agreed to the Terms of Use, which contained arbitration clauses.

  2. Defendants contended that the district court incorrectly held that the enforceability and scope of the arbitration clauses were issues for the court, rather than the arbitrator, to resolve.

  3. Defendants asserted that the arbitration clauses in their Terms of Use applied to Plaintiffs’ antitrust claims because those claims related to Plaintiffs’ access and use of Defendants’ platforms.

  4. Defendants argued that the district court erred in finding that Grubhub failed to establish that it formed an agreement to arbitrate with Plaintiffs.

  5. Uber and Postmates specifically argued that the district court erred by not enforcing the delegation clause in their Terms of Use, which they claimed required the arbitrator, not the court, to decide questions of arbitrability.'
