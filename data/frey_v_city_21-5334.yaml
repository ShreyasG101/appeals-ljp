outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Jason Frey, Brianna Frey, William Sappe''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that New York''s prohibition on carrying firearms in ''sensitive locations''—specifically Times Square, the New York City subway system, and the Metro-North rail system—violates the Second Amendment.

  2. Appellants contended that New York''s ban on open carry of firearms infringes upon their Second Amendment rights.

  3. Appellants argued that the requirement for a State concealed carry license holder to apply for and receive a City-specific permit in order to carry a firearm in New York City is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.

  4. Appellants asserted that the district court erred in denying their motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of these provisions.

  5. Appellants claimed that the government failed to demonstrate that the challenged provisions are consistent with the Nation’s historical tradition of gun regulations as required by the Supreme Court’s decision in Bruen.

  6. Appellants disputed the district court’s finding that they lacked standing to challenge the open carry ban, arguing that their stated intentions and fears of prosecution were sufficient to establish standing.

  7. Appellants challenged the district court’s conclusion that the City’s special permit requirement is supported by a historical tradition of municipal-level firearm regulation.'
