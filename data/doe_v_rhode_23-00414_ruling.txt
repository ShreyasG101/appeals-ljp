WILLIAM E. SMITH, District Judge.                                         
    Youth  in  this  country  are  experiencing  a  mental  health       
crisis.1  The rates of depression and anxiety among teens have            
skyrocketed,  along  with  the  rates  of  teens  considering  and        
committing suicide.2  Research suggests that these alarming trends        

    1 The crisis among children and teens has become so severe           
that the American Academy of Pediatrics has declared it a national        
emergency.  Erica Pandey, The State of the Teen Mental Health

rate of anxiety and depression among teens has increased by more          
than 50% from 2010 to 2019; the suicide rate for children between         
the ages of 10 and 14 has tripled between 2007 and 2021; and the          
stem from the increased use of phones and social media among teens        
and the declining rates of teens spending time with friends in

the COVID-19 pandemic,4 the calamities of the pandemic only served        
to catalyze them.5                                                        
    Extracurriculars  can  serve  as  a  remedy  to  these  damaging     

trends in teen mental health.  One study examined the mental health       
of students during the COVID-19 pandemic and found a correlation          
between students’ participation in extracurricular activities and         
lower rates of anxiety, inattention, hyperactivity, and depressive        
symptoms.6   These results reflect previous research  finding an          

rate of high school girls considering suicide increased from 19%          
in 2011 to 30% in 2021).

    The plaintiff here, John Doe, is like many of his generation.        
He experienced some of high school on a screen at the height of           
the pandemic.  His parents, James and Jane Doe, wanted better.            

After spending a year at a parochial school where there was remote        
learning, John’s parents enrolled him in an out-of-state boarding         
school – where he would repeat freshman year - with the hope that         
he would have a better academic experience and forge in-person            
social connections with other students of his age.  Unfortunately,        
his experience did not pan out as John’s parents had hoped.  While        
in boarding school, John’s academic performance and social and            
physical  health  took  a  steep  decline.    That  summer,  John  was    
diagnosed  with  anxiety,  depression,  and  Attention-  Deficit  /

Model, Systematic Reviews (2023) (providing a comprehensive review        
of studies confirming the association between playing team sports         
and improved mental health).                                              
Hyperactivity   Disorder    (“ADHD”),   among   other    learning         
disabilities.  As part of John’s treatment, doctors recommended he        
get involved in sports.  After John returned to Rhode Island and          
enrolled in a private school, he did just that.  By all accounts,         
his time playing competitive football and basketball made a real          
positive impact on his mental health and overall well-being.              

    John will be a senior next year and wants to continue playing        
on his respective teams.  The only problem, however, is that the          
Rhode Island Interscholastic League (“RIIL” or the “League”) – the        
organization that administers competitive sports in the state -           
has an Eight-Semester Rule (the “Rule”).  Under the Rule, a student       
becomes automatically ineligible to play competitive sports eight         
semesters  from  when  he  enrolls  in  ninth  grade.    John  will  be   
enrolled in his ninth and tenth semesters of high school next year        
because he repeated freshman year at the boarding school.                 
    Despite the mental health crisis that has afflicted John and         
other students in this state and across the country, as well as           
the  universally  recognized  benefits  of  participation  in  high       

school sports,9 the League put its foot down and denied John’s            


    9  DXD,  RIIL  Mission  Statement,  ECF  No.  11-2  (“Athletic       
competition is a major component [of] education. . . . Research           
indicates  that  student-athletes  have  better  grades  than  non-       
athletes and that student-athletes have higher attendance rates           
and higher graduation rates than non-participants.”).                     
request for a waiver of the Rule.  It avers that he is not entitled       
to a waiver as he did not repeat freshman year because of his             
learning  disabilities.    Rather,  it  was  his  parents’  personal      
decision to have John repeat his freshman year.                           
    Instead of having John be fully part of a team, the League           
wants  John  to  sit  on  the  sidelines,  despite  the  demonstrably     

profound benefits that extracurriculars, like team sports, have on        
students’ mental health.  The League insists that the Rule applies        
even though there is no evidence in the record suggesting John’s          
playing would give him or his team an unfair advantage or would           
pose  a  risk  to  other  students’  safety,  or  otherwise  adversely    
affect other players or teams in any way.  Their justification?           
Well, that’s the rule, and rules are rules.10                             


    10  It is curious why competitive high school sports have            
become such an elevated extracurricular activity.  Had John wanted        
to participate in art club, marching band, mock trial, debate club,       
or service club during his ninth and tenth semesters, it is highly        
doubtful that there would be a challenge to his participation.            
Conflicts, like this one, only arise in the context of athletics.         
See, e.g., Doe v. Horne, No. CV-23-00185-TUC-JGZ, 2023 WL 4661831,        
at *22 (D. Ariz. July 20, 2023) (granting preliminary injunction          
that would allow two transgender female students to participate in        
interscholastic sports); D.M. v. Or. Scholastic Activities Ass’n,         
No. 6:22-cv-01228-MC, 2022 WL 17104604, at *4 (D. Or. Nov. 22,            
2022)  (denying  preliminary  injunction  in  case  where  students       
sought  waiver   of  eight-semester   rule  because   of   mental         
disabilities);  Jones   as  next   friend  of   Jimmy  v.   Mass.         
Interscholastic  Athletic  Ass’n,  No.  22-CV-11426-AK,  2022  WL         
6819608,  at  *8  (D.  Mass.  Oct.  1,  2022)  (denying  preliminary      
injunction  over  whether  virtual  students  could  participate  in      
athletics at their local brick-and-mortar schools).  Perhaps it is        
because  youth  sports  have  become  a  $15-billion-a-year  industry     
that requires parents to devote significant time, resources, and          
    As  the  Court  explains  below,  John’s  learning  disabilities     
caused his ineligibility under the Rule and his request for a             
waiver of the Rule is a reasonable accommodation.  The evidence in        
the record convinces the Court that the Rule should not apply here.       
Other equitable considerations further convince the Court that the        
Rule should not apply.                                                    

    John is not an all-star and his school’s athletics program is        
not positioned to win a state championship.  It’s simple: John            
wants to be part of a team during his senior year of high school.         
Like Daniel Ruettiger in the beloved film Rudy, John wants the            
memory of playing on the field (or court) with his teammates.11  He       
is not trying to be the best, take someone else’s place, or gain          
an unfair advantage.  He just wants to play.  For that and the            
reasons  below,  the  Court  GRANTS  John’s  Motion  for  a  Permanent    
Injunction, ECF No. 6.

root, team sports are no different than any other extracurricular.        
Sports, like other school-sanctioned activities, give students an         
outlet  to  socialize,  be  part  of  a  community,  and  use  their      
creativity.  This appears to have been forgotten in the world of          
high school athletics.

    In the fall of 2020, John enrolled in a Rhode Island parochial       
school as a freshman.  Verified Compl. (“VC”) ¶ 6, ECF No. 1.  Like       
much of the country at the time, the school had transitioned to           
remote learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Id.; DXB, James        

Doe Dep. (Jan. 10, 2024) (“James Dep.”) 28-29, ECF No. 11-2.  The         
pandemic  also  prevented  John  –  who  is  involved  in  competitive    
football  and  basketball  –  from  playing  interscholastic  sports      
during the fall semester of his freshman year.  VC ¶ 6; James Dep.        
at 30-31.  Instead, students played fall-semester sports during           
the spring semester.  VC ¶ 6; James Dep. at 30-31.  John ended his        
first freshman year with a grade point average of 89.0 out of 100.

    John’s parents believed there was a “disconnect” between his         
intellect  and  his  academic  performance.    James  Dep.  at  28-29.    
Consequently, John’s parents transferred him to an out-of-state           

boarding  school  to  benefit  from  a  smaller,  more  structured        
environment and opted for him to repeat his freshmen year during          
the 2021-22 school year.  VC ¶ 7; James Dep. at 37.  His parents          
believed the boarding school would have a connected community,            
smaller learning environment, and rigorous academic curriculum.           
James  Dep.  39-42.    John’s  parents,  based  on  advice  they  had     
received, had him repeat freshman year to get the “full four-year         
experience” and benefit from more maturity.  Id. at 43-44.  At the        
time of his transfer, John had not been formally diagnosed with           
any learning disabilities.  VC ¶ 7.                                       
    John’s time at the boarding school, however, only exasperated        
the disconnect his parents perceived.  He struggled academically,         

did  not  connect  with  his  peers,  and  did  not  receive  the         
individualized support that his parents had expected, though he           
did play competitive sports during that time.  James Dep. at 46-

47.  John became depressed, lost significant weight, and returned         
home after the 2021-22 school year.  James Dep. at 46-48, 53-55;          
Parents’ Ltr. at 87-88.  Subsequently, during the summer of 2022,         
John’s pediatrician and psychiatrist formally diagnosed him with          
certain learning disabilities including ADHD, anxiety, and major          

depressive   disorder,  and   identified  writing   and   reading         
impairments.  VC ¶ 9; James Dep. at 53-57; Parents’ Ltr. at 88.           
John’s  pediatrician  prescribed  medication  and  regular  therapy       
sessions.  James Dep. at 55-57.  John also received advice to             
continue participating in competitive sports.  VC ¶ 11; James Dep.        
at 69-70.                                                                 
    John enrolled at a Rhode Island private school as a sophomore        
for  the   2022-23  school  year   where  he  received   academic         
accommodations, an individualized learning plan, and other support        
to address his learning disabilities.  James Dep. at 57-58, 68-

11-2.    John’s  condition  improved,  in  part,  because  of  his        
participation in sports.  VC ¶ 12; James Dep. at 57-58; Parents’          
Ltr. at 88.  According to John’s father, John is “thriving” and           
has  experienced  academic,  social,  physical,  and  psychological       
improvements.  James Dep. at 57-58.  John is currently a junior at        
the private school for the 2023-24 school year and will enroll at         
the school for his senior year.  VC ¶ 13.  Over the past two years,       
John has been on the varsity football and basketball teams and            
would like to continue his involvement next academic year.  Id.;          
James Dep. at 80.                                                         
 B. RIIL and the Eight-Semester Rule                                     
    RIIL  is   a  non-profit   organization  that   administers,         

regulates, and supervises competitive high school sports in Rhode         
Island.  VC ¶ 3; DXE, RIIL Mission Statement 115, ECF No. 11-2;           
DXG, RIIL Rules and Regulations (“RIIL R&R”) art. 1, § 2, ECF No.         
11-2.    The  League  counts  seventy-two  schools  as  its  members,     
including public, private, and parochial schools, all of which pay        
membership dues so their students can participate in competitive          
sports.  See VC ¶ 3; RIIL Mission Statement at 115; DXL, Michael          
Lunney Dep. (Jan. 18, 2024) (“Lunney Dep.”) 10, ECF No. 11-2; RIIL        
R&R art. 1, § 13.  The League is governed by the Principals’              
Committee  on  Athletics,  which  is  composed  of  principals  and       
assistant principals from member schools.  RIIL R&R art. 1, § 2;          
see Lunney Dep. at 10.                                                    

    The  Eight-Semester  Rule  is  articulated  under  Article  III,     
Section (5)(B)(2) of the League’s Rules and Regulations, which            
limits a student’s eligibility to play competitive sports to eight        
consecutive semesters from the time the student first becomes a           
high school freshman.  VC ¶ 21; Lunney Dep. at 21.  A student is          
automatically ineligible for athletic competition four years from         
the date of entry into ninth grade.  Students may seek a waiver of        
the Rule.  See RIIL R&R art. 1, § 16.  A waiver, however, is              
“exceptional and extraordinary relief.”12  Id. § 16(F).                   
    The waiver process begins when a student submits a Waiver            
Request  Form  that  includes  accompanying  documents  such  as          
transcripts, letters of support, medical documents, and documents         

relating  to  a  student’s  individualized  education  plan.    Id.  §    
16(A)-(B).  The request is then reviewed by the Waiver Request            
Hearing  Committee  (“Waiver  Committee”),  which  is  composed  of       

    12  Over the past 10 years, RIIL has granted 34 waivers of the       
Eight-Semester Rule out of the 64 requests that it has received.          
DXJ, Interrogatories of “8 Semester” Waivers Granted 146, ECF No.         
11-2.                                                                     
principals of member schools.  Id. § 16(D).  A student seeking a          
waiver on the basis of an undue hardship bears the burden of              
    convinc[ing]  sixty  percent  (60%)  of  the   [Waiver]              
    Committee  present  and   voting  of  the   extenuating              
    circumstances  constituting  undue  hardship.     Undue              
    hardship  means  a  hardship  peculiar  to  the  student-            
    athlete or individual caused by unforeseen events beyond             
    the election, control or creation of the student-athlete             
    or individual, his/her family, or school.  The Committee             
    interprets undue hardship particular to the situation of             
    the  individual   which  is  so   severe  that   normal              
    application of the Rule(s) is not . . . necessary to                 
    carry out the spirit or the orderly enforcement of the               
    Rule.                                                                
Id. § 16(F) (the “undue hardship standard”).  Those seeking a             
waiver on the basis of a disability must                                  
    show that his/her inability to meet the RIIL rule(s) is              
    the result of a disability, and that s/he otherwise meets            
    all of the essential requirements of participation in                
    RIIL   competition  with   or  without   a   reasonable              
    modification.  The party making a waiver request shall               
    state on the request form that a disability is claimed               
    and specifically identify the disability and hardship.               
    The  party  making  the  request  shall  also  provide  the          
    Committee  with  all  appropriate  evidence  documenting             
    his/her  disability  and  hardship,  including  medical              
    evidence and any applicable [individualized education                
    plan].                                                               
Id. § 16(H) (the “disability standard”).                                  
 C. RIIL Denies John’s Waiver Request                                    
    John applied for a waiver of the Rule in March 2023.  Ex. A          
VC,  RIIL  Waiver  Request  Form  (Mar.  2023),  ECF  No.  1-1.    The    
League’s  Waiver  Committee  reviewed  his  application  and  held  a     
hearing in April 2023.  See Ex. B VC, Waiver Hearing Committee            
Decision (Apr. 27, 2023) (“RIIL Decision”), ECF No. 1-2.  In his          
application,  John  asserted  that  he  needed  to  play  competitive     
sports for a fifth year to, among other reasons, maintain his             
positive  self-esteem,  emotional  well-being,  and  his  ability  to     
engage in the classroom.  Attorney Ltr. at 84.  The application           
also described the challenges he faced while he was enrolled in           
the boarding school.  Id. at 82-83; Evaluation Report at 94-95.           

Attached  to  the  application  were  letters  of  support  from  his     
parents, psychiatrist, and family attorney.  The Waiver Committee         
heard  testimony  from  John,  his  parents,  the  private  school’s      
athletic director, and his family attorney.  See RIIL Decision 1.         
    The Waiver Committee unanimously denied John’s request, which        
the League’s Principals’ Committee on Athletics unanimously upheld        
on appeal.   Id. at 4; VC ¶ 19; DXH, Principals’ Committee on             
Athletics Decision (Aug. 24, 2023) (“Principals’ Decision”) 138-          
41, ECF No. 11-2; see also RIIL R&R art. 1, § 16(E) (outlining            
process to appeal Waiver Committee decisions).  In its decision,          
the Waiver Committee reasoned that it was John’s parents’ “personal       
choice”  to  have  John  transfer  to  the  boarding  school  and  re-    

classify as a freshman despite receiving good grades while enrolled       
in the parochial school.  RIIL Decision at 2.  It also noted that         
John transferred to the boarding school because he did not receive        
enough academic support at the parochial school.  Id.  Moreover,          
it found that, by the time he becomes a senior, he would have             
played eight semesters of sports.  See id. at 2-3.                        
    Because  the   Waiver   Committee  concluded   that   John’s         
ineligibility was not caused by his disability, it applied the            
undue hardship standard rather than the disability standard.  Id.         
at 3; Lunney Dep. at 65-66.  Though the Waiver Committee did not          
apply the disability standard, it nonetheless considered John’s           
learning disability in its calculous.  See Lunney Dep. at 66.             

Consequently,  the  Waiver  Committee  did  not  make  any  findings      
concerning whether a waiver would be a reasonable accommodation           
for  John  or  would  fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  athletic     
competition among member schools.                                         
    A  few  months  after  the  Principals’  Committee  upheld  the      
denial, John filed this lawsuit, alleging that RIIL violated his          
rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act as applied, and          
moved for a preliminary injunction.  See generally VC; Mot. Prelim.       
Inj., ECF No. 6.  Following a conference, the parties agreed to           
engage in a brief, 60-day period of discovery rather than conduct         
an evidentiary hearing.  Text Order (Oct. 23, 2024).  By agreement,       
the parties converted the motion to one for a permanent injunction.       

See Suppl. Mem. Supp. Mot. Inj. Relief (“Pl. Mem.”) 1 n.1, ECF No.        
10; Def.’s Mem. Law Supp. Opp’n (“Def. Mem.”) 1, ECF No. 11-1.            
The  Court  granted  leave  to  Disability  Rights  of  Rhode  Island     
(“DRRI”) to file an amicus brief in support of John.  Text Order          
(Apr. 23, 2024); see DRRI Br. Amicus Curiae, ECF No. 15.  The Court       
 held a hearing on the merits – as provided for by the parties’            
 agreement – on April 25, 2024.                                            
II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW                                                   
      To obtain a permanent injunction, the plaintiff must first           
 make a showing of “actual success” on the merits, and not “only a         
 showing of likelihood of success on the merits” as is required for        

 a preliminary injunction.   NACM-N.E., Inc. v. Nat’l Ass’n of             
 Credit Mgmt., Inc., 927 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2019); see Amoco Prod.        
 Co. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n.12 (1987).  Second,        
 the plaintiff must show four additional factors:                          
      (1) that it has suffered [or will suffer] an irreparable             
      injury  [absent  injunctive  relief];  (2)  that  remedies           
      available  at  law,  such  as  monetary  damages,   are              
      inadequate  to  compensate  for  that  injury;  (3)  that,           
      considering  the  balance  of  hardships  between   the              
      plaintiff  and  defendant,   a  remedy  in  equity   is              
      warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be             
      disserved by a permanent injunction.                                 
 eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006); see             
 United States v. Mass. Water Res. Auth., 256 F.3d 36, 50 n.15 (1st        
 Cir. 2001).                                                               
III.   DISCUSSION                                                           
      Of the factors above, the parties do not dispute that there          
 are no other remedies at law that would adequately compensate John        
 for his future injury.  At its core, John wants to play competitive       
 sports during his senior year.  Other remedies, such as monetary          
 damages, would not address the impending harm of being denied the         
right  to  play  sports.    Only  an  injunction  preventing  the         
application of the Rule would make John whole.  Thus, this factor         
for a permanent injunction is met.  The Court will address the            
other disputed factors in turn.                                           
 A. Actual Success on the Merits                                         
    John alleges the League violated Titles II and III of the ADA        

as  applied  by  denying  him  a  waiver.    “[T]he  ADA  forbids         
discrimination  against  disabled  individuals  in  major  areas  of      
public life, among them employment (Title I of the Act), public           
services (Title II), and public accommodations (Title III).”  PGA         
Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 675 (2001) (footnotes omitted).       
“Congress  enacted  the  ADA  ‘to  address  the  major  areas  of         
discrimination  faced  day-to-day  by  people  with  disabilities,’       
hoping  ‘to  assure  equality  of  opportunity,  full  participation,     
independent  living,  and  economic  self-sufficiency  for   such         
individuals.’”  Dudley v. Hannaford Bros. Co., 333 F.3d 299, 303          
(1st Cir. 2003) (citations omitted) (first quoting 42 U.S.C. §            
12101(b)(4); and then quoting id. § (a)(8)).                              

    Title II of the ADA “prohibits discrimination against persons        
with disabilities by ‘public entities.’”  Parker v. Universidad de        
P.R., 225 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12132).          
The  statute  provides  that  “no  qualified  individual  with  a         
disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from          
participation  in  or  be  denied  the  benefits  of  the  services,      
programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to            
discrimination  by  any  such  entity.”    42  U.S.C.  §  12132.    The   
statute defines a “qualified individual with a disability” as             
    an individual with a disability who, with or without                 
    reasonable  modifications   to  rules,   policies,   or              
    practices,  .  .  .  meets  the  essential  eligibility              
    requirements  for  the  receipt  of  services  or   the              
    participation in programs or activities provided by a                
    public entity.                                                       
Id. § 12131(2).                                                           
    To succeed on a Title II claim, a plaintiff must establish           
“(1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that        
he was either excluded from participation in or denied the benefits       
of some public entity’s services, programs, or activities or was          
otherwise  discriminated  against;  and  (3)  that  such  exclusion,      
denial  of  benefits,  or  discrimination  was  by  reason  of  the       
plaintiff’s disability.”  Parker, 225 F.3d at 5; see 42 U.S.C. §          
12132.                                                                    
    Likewise, Title III provides that “[n]o individual shall be          
discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and          
equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,           
advantages,   or   accommodations  of   any   place   of   public         
accommodation.”  42 U.S.C. § 12182(a); see Dudley, 333 F.3d at 303        
(“[Title III] sends a bluntly worded message . . . : you may not          
discriminate against an individual in the full and equal access to        
goods and services on the basis of a disability.”).  The statute          
also stipulates that “a failure to make reasonable modifications          
. . . when such modifications are necessary” is discrimination            
unless the entity in question can show that “such modifications           
would fundamentally alter the nature” of the program.  42 U.S.C.          
§ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).                                                     
    To succeed on a Title III claim,                                     

    the plaintiff must show that [1] the defendant has a                 
    discriminatory policy or practice in effect; [2] that he             
    (the plaintiff) requested a reasonable modification of               
    that policy which, if granted, would have afforded him               
    access  to  the  desired  goods[,  services,  facilities,            
    privileges, advantages, or accommodations]; [3] that the             
    requested modification – or a modification like it – was             
    necessary  to  afford  that  access;  and  [4]  that  the            
    defendant nonetheless refused to modify the policy or                
    practice.                                                            
Dudley, 333 F.3d at 307 (citing Martin, 532 U.S. at 663 n.38; Amir        
v.  St.  Louis  Univ.,  184  F.3d  1017,  1027  (8th  Cir.  1999);  and   
Johnson v. Gambrinus Co./Spoetzl Brewery, 116 F.3d 1052, 1058-60          
(5th  Cir.  1997)).    Once  the  plaintiff  bears  his  burden  of       
establishing a reasonable accommodation, the burden shifts to the         
defendant  to  show  that  such  a  modification  would  lead  to  a      
“fundamental alteration” of the policy or practice.  Massachusetts        
v. E*Trade Access, Inc., 464 F. Supp. 2d 52, 58 (D. Mass. 2006);          
see Dudley, 333 F.3d at 307-08 (elaborating that, once a reasonable       
modification  is  found,  the  defendant  must  implement  it  unless     
“doing so would alter the fundamental nature of its business, or          
that the requested modification poses a direct threat to the health       
or safety of others” (citations omitted)).                                
    Here,  there  is   no  disagreement  that  John’s   learning         
impairments qualify as a disability under the ADA.  The parties           
instead dispute whether the ADA applies to RIIL; whether there is         
a   causal  connection   between   John’s  disability   and   his         

ineligibility to play competitive sports; and whether John sought         
a reasonable accommodation.                                               
    1. Whether Title II Applies to RIIL                                  
    Preliminarily, the Court must determine whether Title II and         
III of the ADA apply to the League.  See Dudley, 333 F.3d at 307.         
In short, the answer is yes.  The League concedes that Title III          
applies but disputes whether Title II applies.  See Def. Mem. 8;          
Def.’s Reply Br. DRRI’s Br. Amicus Curie 4, ECF No. 16.                   
    Title II covers public entities, which are “ant State or local       
government . . . . [or] any department, agency, special purpose           
district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local          
government.”  42 U.S.C. § 12131(1)(A)-(B).  RIIL argues that Title        

II does not apply to it because it is not a “public entity”; it is        
a  voluntary,  private,  incorporated  non-profit  association  that      
does not receive any state funding.  Def. Mem. 8.                         
    John argues that RIIL is an “instrumentality of the state”           
and is, thus, a “public entity” under the ADA.  Pl. Mem. 24-25.           
In support, he relies on Dennin v. Connecticut Interscholastic            
Athletic Conference, Inc., which found that Connecticut’s version         
of  RIIL  –  the  Connecticut  Interscholastic  Athletic  Conference      
(“CIAC”) – was an “instrumentality of a State.”  913 F. Supp. 663,        
670 (D. Conn. 1996), appeal dismissed, vacated as moot, 94 F.3d 96        
(2d Cir. 1996).  There, the court placed significant weight on the        
fact that public schools both “delegate authority to CIAC to direct       

and control their athletic programs” and play a role in enforcing         
CIAC’s policies.  Id.  In addition to these considerations, the           
court in Pottgen v. Missouri State High School Activities Ass’n           
emphasized that the state’s athletic governing body (the MSHSAA)          
received funding from member schools.  857 F. Supp. 654, 661–62           
(E.D. Mo. 1994), rev’d on other grounds, 40 F.3d 926 (8th Cir.            
1991).  The reasoning in Dennin and Pottgen is consistent with how        
other courts view the role of athletic governing bodies.  See,            
e.g., Isler v. N.M. Activities Ass’n, 893 F. Supp. 2d 1145, 1155          
(D.N.M. 2012) (collecting cases), rev’d on other grounds, No. 10-         
CV-009 MV/WPL,  2013 WL 12328907 (D.N.M. Sept. 25, 2013); Sandison        
v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 863 F. Supp. 483, 487 (E.D.            

Mich. 1994), dismissed in part, rev’d in part, on other grounds,          
64 F.3d 1026 (6th Cir. 1995) (“MHSAA is clearly an agency or other        
instrumentality of the state.”).                                          
    Like the CIAC, MSHSAA, and MHSAA, RIIL is an “instrumentality        
of the state,” and thus a “public entity” for purposes of Title           
III.  RIIL serves as the managing authority for interscholastic           
athletics in Rhode Island.  Member schools – a majority of which          
are public – delegate their authority to RIIL and allow it to use         
their facilities to host events and competitions.  RIIL’s very own        
description   supports  the   proposition   that   RIIL   is  an          
instrumentality of the state: “[RIIL] is a voluntary organization         
of principals who pledge their high schools and participants to           

follow the Rules and Regulations of the League. . . . The purpose         
of the [RIIL] is to supervise and administer the athletic programs,       
contests,  and   schedules  and   matters  related   thereto  in          
participating schools of the State of Rhode Island.”  RIIL Mission        
Statement 1 (emphasis added).  Though it does not receive funding         
directly from the state, it is mostly funded by the “membership           
dues and fees” from public schools.  Id.  Moreover, the governing         
bodies  within  RIIL  are  made  up  of  principals  and  assistant       
principals, many of whom work for public school departments.  Id.;        
see  also  RIIL  Decision  at  2  (identifying  members  of  Waiver       
Committee during John’s hearing, all of whom are principals of            
public schools); Principals’ Decision at 138 (reflecting that nine        

of the ten principals on the Principals’ Committee on Athletics           
during  John’s  hearing  are  employed  at  public  schools).    Taken    
together, these facts convince the Court that RIIL is covered by          
Title II as a “public entity.”                                            
    2. Whether John’s Disability Caused His Exclusion                    
    The League argues that John’s disability did not cause his           
exclusion from competitive sports.  Def. Mem. 10-12.  Under Title         
II, a public entity is liable for disability discrimination if it         
excludes someone “by reason of [his or her] disability.”  42 U.S.C.       
§  12132.    This  language  requires  a  causal  link  between  the      

plaintiff’s disability and the defendant’s discriminatory action.         
See Turner v. U.S. Postal Serv., No. 23-10752-MPK, 2023 WL 6448511,       
at *3 (D. Mass. July 28, 2023); Lewis v. Spurwink Servs., Inc.,           
No. 2:22-cv-00054-NT, 2022 WL 17454078, at *4 (D. Me. Dec. 6,             
2022); accord Washington v. Ind. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 181            
F.3d  840,  848–49  (7th  Cir.  1999);  Starego  v.  N.J.   State         
Interscholastic Athletic Ass’n, 970 F. Supp. 2d 303, 314 (D.N.J.          
2013).  Similarly, Title III imposes liability if the defendant           
discriminates against someone “on the basis of disability.”  42           
U.S.C. § 12182(a).                                                        
    Several courts have had the opportunity to examine the extent        
to which there is a causal connection between a student’s exclusion       

by an age-eligibility rule and his disability.  RIIL heavily relies       
on the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Sandison v. Michigan High School       
Athletic Ass’n.  There, the plaintiff students stayed backed a            
year because of their learning disabilities and, as a result, were        
barred from participating by the MHSAA’s rule prohibiting students        
who turn nineteen on or after September 1 from playing.  Sandison,        
64 F.3d at 1028.  The MHSAA did not allow waivers of the rule.            
Id. at 1029.  In reversing the preliminary injunction enjoining           
the MHSAA from preventing the students from playing, the Sixth            
Circuit reasoned that the plaintiffs’ exclusion was a result of           
their age, not disability.  Id. at 1032, 1036.  In other words,           
their  disabilities   were  not  what   caused  the   plaintiffs’         

ineligibility, but rather it was the “passage of time.”  Id. at           
1031-33.  The Sandison court found MHSAA’s age-eligibility rule to        
be “neutral” in that it only applies when a student turns nineteen        
and is agnostic to a student’s disability.  Id. at 1033.  This            
reasoning led the court to conclude that the students’ exclusion          
was  not  “by  reason  of”  or  “on  the  basis  of”  the  plaintiffs’    
respective disabilities.13  Id.                                           
    John principally relies on two cases.  First, he relies on           
Dennin,  which  involved  a  nineteen-year-old  student  with  Down       
Syndrome  who  received  special  education  and  completed  middle       
school in four years rather than three.  913 F. Supp. at 666.  The        


    13 RIIL also relies on Rhodes v. Ohio High School Athletic           
Ass’n,  939  F.  Supp.  584  (N.D.  Ohio  1996)  which  applied  the      
reasoning  of   Sandison  v.   Michigan  High   School   Athletic         
Association, 64 F.3d 1026 (6th Cir. 1995).  See Def.’s Mem. Law           
Supp. Opp’n 11-12, ECF No. 11-1.  The court in Rhodes found that          
the application of an eight-semester rule to a learning-disabled          
student, who had stayed back a year at a different school, did not        
constitute disability discrimination.  939 F. Supp. at 586-87,            
592.  The court further found that the plaintiff did not repeat           
freshman year only because of his disability, but also because he         
had an unpleasant and inadequate education at his original school.        
Id. at 592.                                                               
CIAC enforced a rule stating that students who turn nineteen on or        
after  September  1  cannot  play  competitively.    Id.    The  court    
enjoined the CIAC from applying its age-eligibility rule.  Id. at         
671.  It reasoned that but for the plaintiff’s disability, he would       
qualify  under  the  age-eligibility  rule.    Id.  at  669-71.    The    
challenges related to the student’s disability caused him to take         

longer to complete middle school, which made him ineligible under         
the CIAC’s age-eligibility rule as a senior.  See id.                     
    Second,  John  relies  on  Washington  v.  Indiana  High  School     
Athletic Ass’n, a Seventh Circuit case that involved a learning-          
disabled student who dropped out after his tenth-grade year because       
of his academic struggles.  181 F.3d at 842.  After dropping out,         
the plaintiff took a test that revealed he was learning disabled.         
Id.  When he returned to the school, the plaintiff wanted to play         
on the school’s basketball team.  Id.  Like the RIIL, the Indiana         
High School Athletic Association (“IHSAA”) had an eight-semester          
rule and denied the plaintiff’s request for a waiver.  Id. at 842-        
43.    Like  in  Dennin,  the  Seventh  Circuit  rejected  Sandison’s     

“passage  of  time”   reasoning  and  affirmed  the   preliminary         
injunction  enjoining  the  IHSAA,  articulating  that  it  was  the      
plaintiff’s disability that caused him to violate the rule.  See          
id. at 848-49, 854.  Had the plaintiff not dropped out because of         
difficulties associated with his learning disabilities, he would          
have complied with the rule.  Id. at 848-49.                              
    Much of the parties’ briefing focuses on the time when John          
transferred from the parochial school to the boarding school and          
repeated freshman year.  John’s disability, it is agreed, did not         
precipitate these events.  Not only was John not diagnosed with           
any learning disabilities by this time, but the record reflects he        
was doing well as a freshman in his parochial school, having an           

average GPA of 89.0 and a PSAT score in the 94th percentile in            
evidence-based reading and writing, and in the 96th percentile in         
math.  Application at 47, 50, 67.  Neither the paperwork from the         
parochial  school  nor  the  application  material  to  the  boarding     
school mentions academic or social difficulties.  In fact, the            
application material emphasizes John’s strong academic abilities.         
See, e.g., id. at 61 (noting John’s “intellect was clear from a           
young age.  He is a voracious reader and has [a] strategic math           
mind”).    Moreover,  John’s  father  admitted  that  what  drove  the    
parents’ decision to transfer John was the lack of sports in the          
fall  due  to  the   pandemic,  the  lack  of  “camaraderie   and         
connectedness in the community,” the limited communication among          

John and his friends, and the implementation of remote learning.          
James Dep. at 28-29; Evaluation Report at 94; see also James Dep.         
at 99-100 (agreeing with the RIIL Decision finding that it was a          
“personal choice” to have John transfer to a boarding school and          
repeat freshman year).                                                    
    The record also reflects that John did not repeat freshman           
year because of his learning disabilities.  Based on advice John’s        
parents  received  from  the  boarding  school’s  administrators,         
advisors, and friends of theirs who have sent their children to           
boarding school, John “reclassif[ied] so that [he] [could] have a         
full four-year experience . . . and . . . [receive the] benefits          

of having a little more maturity and preparation for what is . .          
. a pretty rigorous academic environment.”  James Dep. at 43-44.          
    If the Court were to consider only the facts related to the          
initial transfer, John’s Motion would fail on the merits because          
the record does not demonstrate that it was his disability that           
caused John to transfer and repeat his freshman year.                     
    The analysis changes, however, when looking at the fulcrum of        
events leading up to John’s second transfer, from the boarding            
school  to  his  current  private  school.    The  League’s  counsel      
conceded  at  the  hearing  that,  had  the  plaintiff  not  left  the    
boarding school, he would have been eligible to play sports for           
the remainder of his time there.  See Hr’g Tr. at 11-12, 44-45;           

see  also  James  Dep.  at  46  (describing  how  it  was  James’s        
understanding that John could have played four years of sports at         
the boarding school).  Said differently, the boarding school would        
have allowed him to play competitively through his senior year.           
It was only when John returned to Rhode Island to enroll in the           
private school that he fell under the jurisdiction of the League          
and its Eight-Semester Rule.  See Hr’g Tr. at 44.  The Rule goes          
into effect once John enrolls in ninth grade, irrespective of where       
he is schooled, if he enrolls in a school governed by the RIIL.           
See id. at 44-46.                                                         
    The  record  demonstrates  that  John  transferred  from  the        
boarding school to the private school because of his disability.          

After enrolling at the boarding school, John experienced a decline        
in his academic performance and a deterioration of his physical           
and psychological health.  For example, John became isolated and          
anti-social, lost about sixty pounds, acted out, and failed to            
maintain routines for academic success.  James Dep. at 46-49, 51-         
54; Evaluation Report at 94-95.  This led to a decline in John’s          
grades.  See James Dep. at 51-52.  At the same time, the boarding         
school did not provide the personalized attention or services to          
address John’s needs.  Id. at 47-48; Attorney Ltr. at 83; Parents         
Ltr. at 87-88.  This required John to return to Rhode Island and          
enroll in a school that could adequately address his needs, for           
example, with an individualized support plan and counseling.  See         

James Dep. at 55-58; Attorney Ltr. at 82-83; John Doe Ltr. at 85;         
Parents’ Ltr. at 88.                                                      
    As in Washington and Dennin, he cannot comply with the Rule          
because  of  his  transfer,  which  is  directly  a  result  of  his      
disability.    But  for  his  learning  disability  and   related         
conditions, John would not have transferred from the out-of-state         
boarding school back to the Rhode Island private school to receive        
appropriate educational programming.  Had John not been suffering         
from anxiety, depression, and ADHD, among other impairments, he           
would have completed his time at the boarding school and played           
sports through his senior year.  Cf. Washington, 181 F.3d at 849          
(agreeing  with  the  lower  court  that,  but  for  the  plaintiff’s     

disability, he would have been “fully capable of performing in            
high school” and would not have had to drop out).  Only when he           
returned to Rhode Island did he face the possibility of     being         
prohibited from playing competitive sports during his senior year.        
Accordingly,  the  evidence  establishes  that  there  is  a  causal      
connection between John’s disability and his inability to meet the        
requirements of the Rule.14                                               

    14 In the RIIL Decision, the League improperly applied its own       
rules, preventing it from examining the extent to which John’s            
disability caused his exclusion from playing sports during his            
senior year.  Rather than apply the disability standard, it applied       
the undue hardship standard, even though John sought a waiver on          
the basis of his disability.  Compare Ex. B VC, Waiver Hearing            
Committee Decision (Apr. 27, 2023) 2-3, ECF No. 1-2; DXL, Michael         
Lunney Dep. (Jan. 18, 2024) (“Lunney Dep.”) 53, ECF No. 11-2; and         
PXC, Def.’s Answers Pl.’s First Set Interrog. 1, ECF No. 10-3 with        
Lunney Dep. at 63; and DXD, Attorney Ltr. 82-83, ECF No. 11-2.            
Under the League’s disability rule – which roughly parrots the            
requirements of the ADA – the student must show that ”his/her             
inability to meet the RIIL rule(s) is the result of a disability.”        
RIIL R&R art. 1, § 16(H).  By applying the undue hardship rule,           
rather  than  the  disability  rule,  the  Waiver  Committee  did  not    
properly examine the causal nexus between John’s disability and           
his ineligibility under the Rule.                                         
    Even if the League did apply the disability standard, that           
may not have solved the League’s problem because the Rule does not        
appear to comply with the ADA.  Under the Rule, in addition to            
    3. Whether John Requested a Reasonable Modification                  
    The guiding framework for determining whether a modification         
is reasonable is outlined in PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, requiring          
courts to employ an “individualized inquiry.”  532 U.S. at 688;           
see Gelabert-Ladenheim v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 252 F.3d 54, 59 (1st        
Cir. 2001).  Martin examined the PGA Tour’s walking rule, which           

requires golfers, during tournament play, to walk the entire golf         
course.  Martin, 532 U.S. at 666-67.  The purpose of the rule is          
to subject players to fatigue during competition.  Id. at 686.            
The  plaintiff  in  Martin  was  a  professional  golfer  who  had  a     
degenerative circulatory disorder that limited his ability to walk        
without suffering serious complications.  Id. at 668.  Despite his        
documented medical issues with walking, the PGA denied his request        
to waive the walking rule and to utilize a golf cart.  Id. at 669.        
In response, the plaintiff in Martin brought an action under Title        



demonstrating that the student’s disability caused his exclusion,         
the student must provide evidence of hardship.  See id.  Facially,        
this conflicts with the ADA because the statute requires an entity        
to  provide  a  reasonable  accommodation  upon  a  showing  of  a        
qualifying disability, not an undue hardship.  See 42 U.S.C. §§           
12182(a), 12132.  By reverting to the “undue hardship” requirement,       
the Rule appears to impose additional criteria that raises the            
threshold for obtaining an accommodation, which is prohibited by          
the ADA.  See 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8) (“A public entity shall not        
impose or apply eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to           
screen out an individual with a disability . . . from fully and           
equally enjoying any service, program, or activity, unless such           
criteria can be shown to be necessary.”).  In short, both the face        
and application of the waiver rules appear flawed.                        
III,  arguing  that  the  PGA  failed  to  accommodate  his  physical     
disability.  Id.                                                          
    The Supreme Court concluded that allowing the use of a golf          
cart during tournament play was a reasonable accommodation.  Id.          
at 682.  To comply with the ADA, an entity’s policies, practices,         
or procedures must be (1) reasonably modified for individuals with        

disabilities as necessary to afford access, (2) unless doing so           
would fundamentally alter what is offered.  Id.; see also 28 C.F.R.       
§ 36.302(a).  In Martin, the Supreme Court found that waiving the         
walking rule would not fundamentally alter competition because it         
neither changed an “essential aspect” of the game nor gave the            
disabled plaintiff an advantage over other players.  Id. at 682-          
83.    Thus,  waiving  the  rule  would  not  upset  the  “fundamental    
character” or and “essential attribute” of the game.15  Id. at 684-       
85.  A determination of whether a modification is reasonable is a         
fact-specific inquiry.  Starego, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 309.  It is           
the  defendants’   burden  to  demonstrate   that  a   reasonable         
modification “would alter the fundamental nature” of a program or         



    15 The reasonable accommodation analysis in PGA Tour, Inc. v.        
Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 675 (2001), also applies to Title II claims.        
See, e.g., Cruz v. Pa. Interscholastic Athletic Ass’n, 157 F. Supp.       
2d  485,  498–99   (E.D.  Pa.  2001);  see   also  28  C.F.R.  §          
35.130(b)(7)(i)  (“A   public   entity  shall   make   reasonable         
modifications . . . unless the public entity can demonstrate that         
making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of          
the service, program, or activity.”).                                     
“pose[]  a  direct  threat  to  the  health  or  safety  of  others.”     
Dudley, 333 F.3d at 307-08.                                               
    Waiving the Rule is a reasonable accommodation because doing         
so is necessary to afford John access to competitive sports.  See         
42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii); Martin, 532 U.S. at 688.  But the         
League argues that waiving the Rule with respect to John “would           

alter the nature of the program.”  Def. Mem. 14.  It posits that          
John would take the starting place of other students and cause            
“[un]fairness” among student athletes.  Id. at 15.  It principally        
relies on two cases that found as such.  See id. at 13-15 (relying        
on McPherson v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 119 F.3d 453, 461-        
63 (6th Cir. 1997); Pottgen, 40 F.3d at 929-31).                          
    The League has not shown that a waiver would fundamentally           
alter high school athletics in Rhode Island.  The Supreme Court in        
Martin  outlined  two   modifications  that  may  “constitute  a          
fundamental alteration.”  532 U.S. at 682.  Either the change             
modifies  an  “essential  aspect  of  the  game”  that  affects  all      
competitors – e.g., changing the diameter of a golf hole – or it          

alters a “peripheral” rule that may “nevertheless give a disabled         
player . . . an advantage over others.”  Id. at 682-83.  Neither          
are present here.                                                         
    First, the Eight-Semester Rule is not an “essential aspect”          
of competition.  Id. at 682.  What is essential are the rules for         
the respective sports to ensure both fairness and safety among            
students.      See,    e.g.,   RIIL   R&R    art.   15,   §   1,          
https://www.riil.org/page/3045  (last  visited   May  28,   2024)         
(mandating that all basketball games play according to the National       
Federation  of  State  High  School  Association  Basketball  Rules);     
RIIL  R&R,  art.  19,  §  1,  https://www.riil.org/page/3049  (last       
visited  May  28,  2024)  (outlining  the  rules  of  contact  for        

football).  Nor does it affect the League’s governing values such         
as  “equity,  fairness,  and  justice,”  “fair  play  and  honorable      
competition,” and “treating people with dignity and respect.”  RIIL       
Mission Statement at 1.                                                   
    To be sure, the Rule is not meaningless as it aims to prevent        
redshirting,16 ensure no student or team has an unfair advantage,         
and maintain competitor safety.  Even still, the Rule is “at best         
peripheral.”  See Martin, 532 U.S. at 689.  This is because the           
League, when pressed, did not articulate a justification for why          
the Rule is essential to Rhode Island high school athletics.  The         
League’s explanation for why the Rule must be enforced here boils         
down to the idiom, “rules are rules.”  See Hr’g Tr. at 31-32, 39.         

This explanation, however, cannot satisfy the League’s burden on          
its own.  Cf. Martin, 532 U.S. at 689 (“[P]etitioner’s claim that         
all  the  substantive  rules  .  .  .  are  sacrosanct  and  cannot  be   

    16  Redshirting is the act of gaining a competitive advantage        
over  other  students  by  repeating  a  year  of  school  to  have       
additional time to grow, develop, and mature.  McPherson v. Mich.         
High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, Inc., 119 F.3d 453, 456 (6th Cir. 1997).        
modified under any circumstances is effectively a contention that         
it   is  exempt   from   Title  III’s   reasonable   modification         
requirement.”).    The  League  also  suggests  that  the  Rule  is       
essential because it promotes harmony among the member schools.           
See Hr’g Tr. at 31-33.  But the League did not explain how waiving        
the Rule here would upset that harmony.                                   

    More significant, however, was the League’s concession that          
a student who, before enrolling in high school, spent two years in        
athletic training but only used a tutor without obtaining credit,         
would be allowed to play high school sports in Rhode Island if he         
were to enroll in ninth grade at fifteen or sixteen.  See id. at          
44-46.  If that student could avoid the application of the Rule,          
which undermines the League’s goal of preventing redshirting and          
protecting the health and safety of competitors, it is difficult          
to  conclude  that  waiving  the  Rule  with  respect  to  John  would    
fundamentally  alter  the  nature  of  athletic  programming.    This     
workaround demonstrates that the Rule is not essential.                   
    Second,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  waiver  of  this        

“peripheral” rule would give John or his team an unfair advantage         
over non-disabled students or other teams.  See Martin, 532 U.S.          
at 682-85.  The record is clear that John is not redshirting.  In         
fact, John’s father testified that John does not plan on playing          
sports in college.  James Dep. at 110.  Moreover, John would not          
be taking another student’s place if he were to play, given that          
every non-freshman makes the varsity team.  See id. at 83-85; Hr’g        
Tr. at 47-48.  And there is no evidence to suggest that he is             
guaranteed to have a starting position next year.  See James Dep.         
at 83-85.  This fact also leads the Court to conclude that a waiver       
for John would not upset fair competition in the state.  See Cruz,        
157 F. Supp. 2d at 493, 500 (relying on the school’s no-cut policy        

to discount the defendant’s concern over plaintiff taking another         
student’s place).  To put it bluntly, John’s school does not seem         
to have an athletics program that is contending to win a state            
championship.  Given the dearth of evidence of John’s athletic            
abilities and his father’s own testimony, it is fair to say that          
John is not playing a fifth year of sports to be the next Roland          
Steele, see James Dep. at 110, undermining the League’s argument          
that John’s presence would fundamentally alter competition.  See          
Cruz,  157  F.  Supp.  2d  at  493,  499  (noting  that  the  plaintiff   
student is not a “‘star’ player in any of his interscholastic             
sports”  in  concluding  that  allowing  him  to  play  would  not        
“fundamentally alter” competition).                                       

    Taken together, there is no evidence to suggest that waiving         
the Rule here would alter an “essential aspect” of competition or         
give John or his team an unfair advantage.  See Pottegen, 40 F.3d         
at 932-33 (Arnold, J., dissenting) (“But if a rule can be modified        
without doing violence to its essential purposes, . . . I do not          
believe that it can be ‘essential’ to the nature of the program or        
activity to refuse to modify the rule.”).                                 
                     *    *    *    *    *                               
     In sum, John has demonstrated actual success on the merits.         
The record demonstrates that Titles II and III of the ADA apply to        
the League, John’s disability caused his exclusion under the Rule,        

and a waiver of the Rule would be a reasonable accommodation that         
would not fundamentally alter the nature of high school athletic          
competition in Rhode Island.  The Court will now turn to the other        
equitable considerations.                                                 
 B. Irreparable Harm                                                     
    John would be irreparably harmed if barred from playing sports       
during  his  senior  year.    As  part  of  John’s  diagnosis  for        
depression, anxiety, and ADHD, among his other diagnoses, doctors         
recommended  that  John  get  involved  in  interscholastic  sports.      
That, along with medication and academic support, improved John’s         
academic, social, physical, and psychological well-being.  This           
assertion is supported by John’s psychiatrist, James Dep. at 55-          

58, and is recognized by the League’s very own mission statement.17       

    17 RIIL Mission Statement at 115-16 (“Athletic competition is        
a major component [of] education. . . . Research indicates that           
student-athletes  have  better  grades  than  non-athletes  and  that     
student-athletes  have   higher  attendance   rates  and   higher         
graduation rates than non-participants.”); id. at 116 (“Sports and        
activities provide not only the opportunity to teach and learn            
respect  for  self  and  respect  for  others,  they  also  place         
participants in a unique context - competition - that can further         
Preventing John from being part of a team – competition and all –         
risks  reversing  the  progress  he  has  made  in  addressing  his       
psychological challenges.  See Cruz, 157 F. Supp. 2d at 491-92,           
500 (similarly finding that preventing the plaintiff student from         
participating in competitive sports would cause irreparable harm          
considering his IEP); Dennin, 913 F. Supp. at 667 (describing how         

preventing the student from playing interscholastic sports would          
irreparably harm the student’s self-esteem and social skills); cf.        
Washington, 181 F.3d at 853 (positively considering the academic          
and social benefits that competitive sports have on the plaintiff’s       
high school experience).                                                  
    At  an  intangible  level,  if  John  were  barred  from  playing    
competitively, he would miss out on creating unique memories as a         
senior in high school.  Simply put, John is only a senior once in         
his life.  As Coach Dan Devine said in Rudy, “And for you seniors,        
it’s your last one, so make it count because you’ll remember it           
for the rest of your lives.”18  Such memories are priceless and           
constitute irreparable harm in their absence.  See Lyon v. Ill.           

High Sch. Ass’n, No. 13 C 173, 2013 WL 309205, at *5 (N.D. Ill.           
Jan. 25, 2013) (finding the student’s argument that he may miss “a        
once in lifetime opportunity” by not playing sports persuasive if         

instill and hone values necessary for the development of respect          
for self and respect for others.”).                                       
    18 Rudy (Sony Pictures Entertainment 1993).                          
it  had  to  consider  the  student’s  irreparable  harm,  albeit  the    
student did not establish a likelihood of success on the merits).         
    The League avers that John would not be irreparably harmed           
because he could still practice and scrimmage with the team and           
assist  in  charitable  work.    Def.  Mem.  19;  Hr’g  Tr.  at  38-39.   
Anyone  who  has  played  high  school  sports  or  engaged  in  other    

competitive activities know that just practicing with a team is no        
substitute  to  being  part  of  a  team  in  competition,  especially    
during one’s senior year.  Relegating John to just practice would         
fundamentally alter his athletic experience.  It is not difficult         
to imagine that being excluded from competition would also change         
the way he and his teammates would practice, seeing as there is no        
incentive for the team to actively integrate him in practice.  And        
the League’s argument does not tackle the very real possibility           
that preventing John from competing with his team would negatively        
affect his progress in addressing his disabilities.  Accordingly,         
the  Court  finds  that  John  would  be  irreparably  harmed  absent     
injunctive relief.                                                        

 C. Balance of Equities                                                  
    In balancing the equities, the Court concludes that the harm         
imposed on John is greater than that imposed on RIIL.  As discussed       
above, by not competing, John could lose out on athletic programs         
that have had a substantial benefit on his overall well-being and         
his efforts to overcome his learning disabilities, in addition to         
the memories he would gain by playing.                                    
    The League complains of the floodgate of requests that it            
could receive if the Court were to grant the injunction.  Def.            
Mem.  20-21.    RIIL’s  assertion,  however,  is  neither  backed  by     
adequate evidence, nor compelling even if true.  Over the past ten        

years, it has received 64 waiver requests, an average of a little         
under 7 per year.  Id. at 20.  Of those requests, the League does         
not  identify  those  like  John’s  situation  that  would  likely  be    
approved if the League complied with the ADA.  And the League does        
not endeavor to predict how many students would seek a waiver if          
the Court finds in John’s favor.  Given that the exigencies of the        
COVID-19 pandemic are behind us and the unusual nature of John’s          
predicament, a scenario in which the League will be inundated with        
waiver requests like John’s seems unlikely.  But more importantly,        
the League’s point amounts to saying that accommodating people            
with  disabilities  is  hard  and  they  should  not  have  to  do  it.   
Treating people with disabilities with sensitivity and compassion         

may  take   some   effort  and   require  previously   unimagined         
flexibility, it is true.  But that is what living in a civilized          
society is all about and what the law demands of us.                      
    In summary, the balance of equities weighs in John’s favor.          
See Washington, 181 F.3d at 853 (finding no abuse of discretion           
where the lower court valued the benefits of competitive sports to        
the plaintiff over the concerns of the sports league, namely the          
administrative burdens, the fear the plaintiff would take another         
student’s place, and potential unfair advantages).                        
  D. Public Interest                                                      
     A permanent injunction would not negatively affect the public        
interest.  In fact, it would serve the public interest.  Achieving        

the goal of full inclusion of disabled individuals in economic and        
social life is in the public’s interest.  See Martin, 532 U.S. at         
674-75; Dudley, 333 F.3d at 303.  Allowing disabled students to           
play in competitive sports contributes to that goal.  Steines ex          
rel. Steines v. Ohio High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 68 F. Supp. 3d 768,        
783 (S.D. Ohio 2014).  Moreover, there is no evidence in the record       
to suggest that John’s involvement in competitive sports would            
significantly affect the level of competition within the league,          
pose any harm to other students, or displace other students.  See         
Washington, 181 F.3d at 853-54.  Thus, the public interest would          
not be adversely affected in issuing a permanent injunction here.         

IV.   CONCLUSION                                                           
     Rudy had no business playing on the Norte Dame football team.        
As a defensive end, he simply did not have the skills like his            
compatriots.    Nevertheless,  with  the  support  of  his  cheering      
teammates and fans packed in Notre Dame Stadium, he got his chance        
to play.  Why?  Because everyone recognized the importance of Rudy        
having his one moment, one memory, playing as a senior with the           
Fighting  Irish.    John  Doe  is  like  Rudy.    He  may  not  be  a  future 
Heisman  Trophy  recipient,  but,  even  so,  he  deserves  his  moment  to 
play  competitively  with  his   team  as   a   senior.     Those   are   the 
memories  that  will  stick  with  him. 
     This   Court   says,   let   the   kid  play.    Accordingly,   for  the 
reasons  above,  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for  a  Permanent  Injunction,  ECF 
No.  6,  is  GRANTED. 

IT  IS  SO  ORDERED.
