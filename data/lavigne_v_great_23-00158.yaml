outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Amber Lavigne''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in dismissing her claim because her allegations sufficiently established the existence of a policy or custom of withholding information from parents regarding students'' gender identity and gender expression.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred by declining to address the first element of municipal liability (i.e., whether there was a constitutional violation) and instead resolving the case solely on the second element (i.e., whether the Board was responsible for the alleged violation).

  3. Appellant argued that her allegations established that the Board violated her constitutional right to direct the education and upbringing of her child by withholding information about her child''s use of a chest binder and different name and pronouns at school.

  4. Appellant asserted that the Board could be held liable under a theory of ratification because the Board and school officials made statements defending the legality of the staff''s conduct and renewed the contract of the social worker involved, which she claimed amounted to ratification of the alleged unconstitutional acts.'
