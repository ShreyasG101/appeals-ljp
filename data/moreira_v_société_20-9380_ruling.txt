JESSE M. FURMAN, United States District Judge:                            
The heirs of former owners of Banco Pujol — a Cuban bank confiscated by the Castro 
regime in 1960 and absorbed into Banco Nacional de Cuba (“BNC”) — brought this suit against 
two French banks, Société Générale, S.A. (“SG”) and BNP Paribas, S.A. (“Paribas”), for 
“trafficking” their confiscated assets by doing business with BNC, in violation of Title III of the 
Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act of 1996, 22 U.S.C. § 6021 et seq., commonly 
known as the Helms-Burton Act.  In a prior Opinion and Order, familiarity with which is 
presumed, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claims against SG as untimely.  See Pujol Moreira v. 
Société Générale, S.A. (“Pujol Moreira II”), No. 20-CV-9380 (JMF), 2023 WL 359446 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2023) (ECF No. 94); see also Pujol Moreira v. Société Générale, S.A. (“Pujol 
Moreira I”), 573 F. Supp. 3d 921 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (ECF No. 60) (granting an earlier motion to 
dismiss, but with leave to amend).  In that same Opinion, the Court explained that the timeliness 
of Plaintiffs’ claims against Paribas turned in the first instance on whether certain conduct 
alleged in the Second Amended Complaint — to wit, that “Paribas routinely provides to BNC in 
Switzerland parcels of U.S. currency,” that it did so in 2020, and that there is “no reason to 
believe Paribas stopped,” ECF No. 67 (“SAC”), ¶ 49 — qualifies as “trafficking” within the 
meaning of the Helms-Burton Act.  See Pujol Moreira II, 2023 WL 359446, at *3.  The Court 
ordered additional briefing on that question (and one other).  See id. at *4.1 

In assessing whether Paribas’s alleged conduct within the relevant period constitutes 
“trafficking,” the Court must, of course, apply the well-established standards that govern motions 
to dismiss.  These standards require a court to accept all well-pleaded allegations as true and 
draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  See, e.g., Lynch v. City of New York, 952 
F.3d 67, 74-75 (2d Cir. 2020).  A claim will survive a motion to dismiss, however, only if the 
plaintiff alleges facts sufficient “to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. 
Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff 
pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is 
liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Twombly, 
550 U.S. at 556).  Significantly, “[t]he plausibility standard . . . asks for more than a sheer 

possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.  Where a complaint pleads facts that are merely 
consistent with a defendant’s liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and 
plausibility of entitlement to relief.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (cleaned up).  At bottom, if the 
plaintiff’s pleadings do “not nudge[ his or her] claims across the line from conceivable to 
plausible, [the] complaint must be dismissed.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570. 



1    The other question was, if the alleged deliveries of cash qualified as “trafficking,” 
whether it would be proper to exercise personal jurisdiction over Paribas.  See 2023 WL 359446, 
at *4.  Although personal jurisdiction is usually a threshold issue, the Court addresses the 
timeliness question first for reasons explained in Pujol Moreira II.  See id. at *2. 
Applying these standards, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ allegations with respect to 
Paribas delivering U.S. dollars to BNC in Switzerland fall short.  The Helms-Burton Act 
provides that any person who “traffics in property which was confiscated by the Cuban 
Government” is liable to “any United States national who owns the claim to such property.”  22 

U.S.C. § 6082(a)(1)(A).  The Act then provides, in relevant part, that    
a person “traffics” in confiscated property if that person knowingly and 
intentionally —                                                      

  (i)  sells, transfers, distributes, dispenses, brokers, manages, or otherwise 
     disposes of confiscated property, or purchases, leases, receives, possesses, 
     obtains control of, manages, uses, or otherwise acquires or holds an 
     interest in confiscated property,                               

  (ii)  engages in a commercial activity using or otherwise benefiting from 
     confiscated property, or                                        

  (iii) causes, directs, participates in, or profits from, trafficking (as described in 
     clause (i) or (ii)) by another person, or otherwise engages in trafficking (as 
     described in clause (i) or (ii)) through another person,        

without the authorization of any United States national who holds a claim to the 
property.                                                            

Id. § 6023(13)(A).  As broad as this definition of “trafficking” is, the mere act of delivering cash 
to BNC — and that is all the relevant new allegation entails2 — does not fall within it.  The 

2    As the Court observed in Pujol Moreira II, the Second Amended Complaint does allege, 
“[u]pon information and belief,” that “BNC uses the U.S. currency provided by Paribas to 
continue to access international markets and conduct transactions, including on behalf of its 
clients, that it would not otherwise be able to access or conduct.”  SAC ¶ 49; see also id. ¶ 53 
(“Through at least 2020, Paribas . . . provided physical U.S. dollars to BNC that BNC need[ed] 
to operate as a commercial bank but could not itself access or provide to its clients.”).  But the 
Court noted that “that allegation is arguably not well pleaded.”  2023 WL 359446, at *3; see, 
e.g., Citizens United v. Schneiderman, 882 F.3d 374, 384 (2d Cir. 2018) (“A litigant cannot 
merely plop ‘upon information and belief’ in front of a conclusory allegation and thereby render 
it non-conclusory.”); Boehm v. SportsMem, LLC, No. 18-CV-556 (JMF), 2019 WL 3239242, at 
*2 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2019) (noting that an allegation upon information and belief “must be 
accompanied by a statement of the facts upon which the belief is founded, and cannot rest on 
pure conjecture and speculation” (cleaned up)).  In their supplemental submission, Plaintiffs do 
Second Amended Complaint plainly does not allege that the cash allegedly provided by Paribas 
was itself confiscated property.  Nor does it include any facts concerning the amount of currency 
provided; the frequency of the deliveries; or, most significantly, what, if anything, BNC did with 
the currency and whether BNC gave anything to Paribas in exchange for it.  In the absence of 

any factual context, the Second Amended Complaint does not support a plausible inference that 
the deliveries were “commercial activity,” let alone commercial activity that involved “using or 
otherwise benefiting from” Plaintiffs’ confiscated property.  22 U.S.C. § 6023(13)(A)(ii).  Nor 
does it support a plausible inference that, through the deliveries, Paribas “cause[d], direct[ed], 
participate[d] in, or profit[ed] from” any trafficking, let alone any trafficking of Plaintiffs’ 
confiscated property.  Id. § 6023(13)(A)(iii).  Put simply, “the well-pleaded facts do not permit 
the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct” during the relevant period.  
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (“Factual allegations must be enough 
to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . .”).         
Significantly, Plaintiffs’ own submission in response to the Court’s request for additional 

briefing confirms that their arguments are based not on the mere act of giving cash to BNC, but 
rather on rank speculation about Paribas’s reasons for allegedly doing so.  That is, Plaintiffs 
repeatedly and explicitly predicate their arguments on conditions that may or may not be met:  
If BNC pays for the dollars Paribas delivers, Paribas necessarily “profits from” 
BNC’s use of Banco Pujol’s assets since those assets are an integral part of 
BNC’s capital structure.  22 U.S.C. § 6023(13)(A)(iii).  If Paribas is transferring 
cash on behalf of clients who have business with BNC, Paribas “participates in” 
BNC’s trafficking by facilitating transactions that exploit Banco Pujol’s assets.  
Id.                                                                  

not even attempt to assert otherwise and, thus, are deemed to have abandoned any such 
argument.  Cf., e.g., Felix v. City of New York, 344 F. Supp. 3d 644, 654 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) 
(“Courts may, and generally will, deem a claim abandoned when a plaintiff fails to respond to a 
defendant's arguments that the claim should be dismissed.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 
Paribas is also trafficking by engaging in “commercial activity using or otherwise 
benefiting from” Plaintiffs’ confiscated property.  22 U.S.C. §6023(13)(A)(ii). . . .  
If Paribas is lending BNC the money, that lending benefits from confiscated 
property because Banco Pujol’s assets “made BNC a more stable, less risky, and 
more desirable counterparty” for Paribas.  SAC ¶ 54.  If Paribas is facilitating 
transactions, those transactions use or benefit from Banco Pujol’s assets because 
they made BNC a better counterparty for Paribas’s clients or because they make 
use of BNC’s services — services BNC provides thanks to the “assets,” 
“infrastructure,” and “equity” stolen from Plaintiffs.  Id. ¶¶ 26-29, 42, 53. 
ECF No. 95 (“Pls.’ Supp. Mem.”), at 2-3 (emphases added and footnote omitted).  The tell, of 
course, is Plaintiffs’ repeated use of the word “if.”  If the Second Amended Complaint included 
any of the allegations in Plaintiffs’ memorandum, perhaps the purported deliveries would qualify 
as “trafficking.”  (The Court need not and does not intimate a view.)  But as Plaintiffs effectively 
concede, the Second Amended Complaint does not include any of these allegations.  See also 
ECF No. 97, at 5 n.4.  As if to prove the point, Plaintiffs preface their discussion by observing 
that “[o]nly merits discovery will tell whether the dollars Paribas furnishes to BNC are 
disbursements from a credit facility or transfers on behalf of Paribas clients doing business with 
or through BNC.”  Pls.’ Supp. Mem. 2.  That may well be true, but as the Supreme Court has 
expressly held, Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “does not unlock the doors of 
discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions” and speculation.  Iqbal, 556 
U.S. at 678-79.                                                           
In short, Plaintiffs have not “nudged their claims” of trafficking within the two-year 
period before they filed suit “across the line from conceivable to plausible.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. 
at 570.  It follows that, for reasons the Court discussed in its prior Opinions, Plaintiffs’ claims 
against Paribas are barred by the Helms-Burton Act, which provides that an action for trafficking 
“may not be brought more than 2 years after the trafficking giving rise to the action has ceased to 
occur.”  22 U.S.C. § 6084.  Accordingly, Paribas’s motion to dismiss must be and is GRANTED, 
and the Court need not and does not address Paribas’s other arguments for dismissal.  Further, 
because the Court previously granted Plaintiffs leave to amend and because Plaintiffs neither 
suggest that they have additional facts that would render their claims against Paribas timely nor 
request leave to amend again, the Court declines to grant Plaintiffs another opportunity to amend. 
See, e.g., Fischman v. Mitsubishi Chem. Holdings Am., Inc., No. 18-CV-8188 (JMF), 2019 WL 
3034866, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 11, 2019); see Pujol Moreira II, 2023 WL 359446, at *4 (denying 
SG leave to amend on similar grounds); cf. Pujol Moreira I, 573 F. Supp. 3d at 934 (“{I]f 
[Plaintiffs] could have [cured their pleading defects] one assumes they would have... .”). 
 The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment consistent with both this Memorandum 
Opinion and Order and Pujol Moreira II, and to close the case.

JESSE M. FURMAN, United States District Judge:                            
    The heirs of former owners of Banco Pujol — a Cuban bank confiscated by the Castro 
regime in 1960 and absorbed into Banco National de Cuba (“BNC”) — bring this suit against 
two French banks, Société Générale, S.A. (“SG”) and BNP Paribas, S.A. (“Paribas”), for 
“trafficking” their confiscated assets by doing business with BNC, in violation of Title III of the 
Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act of 1996, 22 U.S.C. § 6021 et seq., commonly 
known as the Helms-Burton Act.  In an earlier Opinion and Order, the Court dismissed 
Plaintiffs’ claims on the ground that they were barred by Section 6084 of the Helms-Burton Act, 
which provides that an action for trafficking “may not be brought more than 2 years after the 
trafficking giving rise to the action has ceased to occur.”  22 U.S.C. § 6084; see Moreira v. 
Société Générale, S.A., 573 F. Supp. 3d 921 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (ECF No. 60).  Thereafter, 
Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Complaint.  ECF No. 67 (“SAC”).  Defendants 
now move again, pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss.  For 
the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint fails to 
remedy the timeliness problems that doomed their claims against SG.  The Court reserves 
judgment as to the claims against Paribas pending further briefing.       
                         BACKGROUND                                      
    The Court described the relevant background in its prior Opinion and Order, see Moreira, 

573 F. Supp. 3d at 924-25, familiarity with which is presumed.  Accordingly, the Court provides 
here only a short overview before turning to Plaintiffs’ new allegations in the Second Amended 
Complaint, which — to the extent they are well pleaded — are assumed to be true for purposes 
of this motion, see, e.g., Kleinman v. Elan Corp., 706 F.3d 145, 152 (2d Cir. 2013). 
    When Plaintiffs first brought this suit, they alleged that SG and Paribas trafficked their 
confiscated assets by operating credit facilities that made U.S. dollar-denominated loans to BNC.  
See Moreira, 573 F. Supp. 3d at 925.  Significantly, however, Plaintiffs explicitly alleged that 
Paribas operated its credit facilities from 2000 to 2010 and that SG operated its facilities from 
2004 to 2010.  See id. at 928.  As for the period after 2010, Plaintiffs alleged only that 
Defendants “continue[d]” to operate “in substantially the same manner” as before (albeit through 

Euro-denominated credit facilities).  Id. at 928-29.  In dismissing Plaintiffs’ claims, the Court 
concluded that their allegations about Defendants’ post-2010 conduct were conclusory and thus 
insufficiently pleaded and that Plaintiffs’ allegations about Defendants’ pre-2010 conduct, 
although sufficiently pleaded, were not enough to avoid Title III’s two-year statute of repose.  Id. 
at 928-30.  The Court expressed skepticism about Plaintiffs’ ability to address these problems, 
but it nevertheless granted them leave to amend “with the benefit of” its Opinion.  Id. at 934.   
    The Second Amended Complaint includes new allegations in an attempt to demonstrate 
that each Defendant’s conduct continued into the two-year repose period.  As to SG, the Second 
Amended Complaint includes only one new such allegation: that SG trafficked their assets until 
at least mid-2019 by “providing Cuban entities access to foreign currency,” which “[u]pon 
information and belief . . . flow[ed] through BNC, which is the primary financial institution with 
whom foreign companies do business in or with Cuba.”  SAC ¶ 40; see also id. ¶ 42 (“[SG] 
continued, through at least late August or early September 2019, to provide the Cuban 

government — and, upon information and belief, BNC — access to U.S. dollars and other 
foreign currency that Cuba and its primary commercial banking arm (BNC) could not themselves 
access or provide to BNC’s clients.”).  As to Paribas, the Second Amended Complaint alleges 
similarly that Paribas transacted with a Cuban military-linked investment firm and other foreign 
companies that do business in Cuba and that, “[u]pon information and belief, BNC [was] 
involved in at least some of th[ose] transactions because it is the primary financial institution 
with whom foreign companies do business in or with Cuba.”  SAC ¶ 56.  In addition, however, 
Plaintiffs now allege that, “[a]ccording to a former Paribas compliance officer, Paribas routinely 
provides to BNC in Switzerland parcels of U.S. currency,” that it did so in 2020, and there is “no 
reason to believe Paribas stopped.”  Id. ¶ 49.  “Upon information and belief,” the Second 

Amended Complaint continues, “BNC uses the U.S. currency provided by Paribas to continue to 
access international markets and conduct transactions, including on behalf of its clients, that it 
would not otherwise be able to access or conduct.”  Id.; see also id. ¶ 53 (“Through at least 2020, 
Paribas . . . provided physical U.S. dollars to BNC that BNC need[ed] to operate as a commercial 
bank but could not itself access or provide to its clients.”).1           


1    In addition to these new allegations, Plaintiffs renew their allegations regarding 
Defendants’ pre-2010 credit-facilities, see SAC ¶¶ 37-39, 42 (SG); id. ¶¶ 45-47, 50, 53 (Paribas), 
and their allegation that Paribas’s credit facilities were converted to Euros and continued to 
operate post-2010, see id. ¶ 48; see also ECF No. 81 (“Pls.’ Opp’n), at 5, 11.  The Court 
discussed the inadequacies of these allegations in its prior Opinion, see Moreira, 573 F. Supp. 3d 
at 928-30, and thus does not address them again below.                    
                          DISCUSSION                                     
    Defendants advance several arguments in support of dismissal, only two of which the 
Court discusses here.  First, they renew their argument that Plaintiffs’ claims are time barred, 
asserting that the new allegations of trafficking within the repose period are not well pleaded.  

See ECF No. 76 (“Defs.’ Mem.”), at 8-14.  Second, they contend that the Court lacks personal 
jurisdiction over them because the only conduct that could support personal jurisdiction is time 
barred.  See id. at 14-18.  Under other circumstances, the Court would begin with the latter 
argument.  See, e.g., Sinochem Int’l Co. v. Malay. Int’l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-31 
(2007) (“[A] federal court generally may not rule on the merits of a case without first 
determining that it has . . . personal jurisdiction[].”); In re Rationis Ents., Inc. of Pan., 261 F.3d 
264, 267-68 (2d Cir. 2001).  But here, whether there is personal jurisdiction turns in part on 
whether and to what extent Plaintiffs plausibly allege relevant conduct within the two-year 
repose period.  Accordingly, at least with respect to SG, the Court begins with the timeliness of 
Plaintiffs’ claims.  See, e.g., ONY, Inc. v. Cornerstone Therapeutics, Inc., 720 F.3d 490, 498 n.6 

(2d Cir. 2013) (“Although we traditionally treat personal jurisdiction as a threshold question to 
be addressed prior to consideration of the merits of a claim, that practice is prudential and does 
not reflect a restriction on the power of the courts to address legal issues.” (citations omitted)); 
Chevron Corp v. Naranjo, 667 F.3d 232, 246 n.17 (2d Cir. 2012) (addressing the merits before 
personal jurisdiction, noting that the court need not begin with personal jurisdiction where “the 
personal jurisdictional challenges are based on factual allegations that are, in this early posture, 
still under development”).  The Court will begin Plaintiffs’ claims against SG. 
A.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Against SG                                         
    As noted, the Second Amended Complaint contains only one pertinent new allegation 
against SG: that it provided foreign currency to Cuban entities and that, “[u]pon information and 
belief” the foreign currency must have flowed through BNC because it is “the primary financial 
institution with whom foreign companies do business in or with Cuba.”  SAC ¶ 40.2  Defendants 

argue that this allegation, without more, is conclusory and therefore not well pleaded.  See Defs.’ 
Mem. 11-12.  The Court agrees.  “A litigant cannot merely plop ‘upon information and belief’ in 
front of a conclusory allegation and thereby render it non-conclusory.”  See Citizens United v. 
Schneiderman, 882 F.3d 374, 384 (2d Cir. 2018).  In the Second Circuit, pleading on information 
and belief is generally appropriate only where “the facts are peculiarly within the possession and 
control of the defendant or where the belief is based on factual information that makes the 
inference of culpability plausible.”  Arista Recs., LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 2010) 
(citations omitted); see Citizens United, 882 F.3d at 384-85.  Where neither condition is fulfilled, 
the allegation is no more than “pure speculation.”  Singa v. Corizon Health, Inc., No. 17-CV-

4482 (BMC), 2018 WL 324884, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2018); accord Williams v. Calderoni, 
No. 11-CV-3020 (CM), 2012 WL 691832, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2012).       
    Neither condition is fulfilled here.  First, Plaintiffs’ assertion that SG is in “exclusive 
possession of information and documentation relevant to [the allegations at issue],” New York v. 
Town of Clarkstown, 95 F. Supp. 3d 660, 681 (S.D.N.Y. 2015), is hard to square with their 


2    In their motion papers, Plaintiffs also assert that, according to a whistleblower, SG 
“continues to profit from . . . the very same conduct [it] was punished for in 2018” — namely, 
the U.S.-dollar-denominated credit facilities.  Pls.’ Opp’n 8.  But that allegation appears nowhere 
in the Second Amended Complaint and, thus, may not be considered by the Court.  See, e.g., In 
re Bystolic Antitrust Litig., 583 F. Supp. 3d 455, 489 (S.D.N.Y. 2022) (“[I]t is axiomatic that the 
Complaint cannot be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.”). 
reliance on a whistleblower with allegedly intimate knowledge of SG’s Cuba-related business, 
see SAC ¶ 40.  Plaintiffs tout the whistleblower as a “Paris-based [SG] employee” with “personal 
knowledge of the illicit transactions to which SG admitted [in the past].”  SAC ¶ 40; Pls.’ Opp’n 
8.  Indeed, it was this very whistleblower who alerted Plaintiffs’ counsel to SG’s alleged 
trafficking in the first place.  SAC ¶ 40.3  Plaintiffs’ access to inside information thus 

distinguishes this case from those they cite in which information-and-belief pleading was found 
to be proper.  See Benjamin v. Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc., No. 17-CV-1720 (JMF), 2018 
WL 1406620, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 20, 2018) (finding information-and-belief pleading adequate 
where, as the defendant conceded, the plaintiff had “no way of knowing” the defendant’s testing 
practices as to other employees); Altman State Lighting, Inc. v. Smith, No. 20-CV-2575 (NSR), 
2022 WL 374590, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2022) (finding information-and-belief pleading 
adequate with respect to whether the defendant “ha[d] close professional and personal 
relationships” with other people because that would “generally not be known outside of those 
individuals”).  Put simply, Plaintiffs did have a “way of knowing” whether SG’s transactions 

flowed through BNC.  See, e.g., Zeitlin v. Palumbo, 532 F. Supp. 3d 64, 69 (E.D.N.Y. 2021) 
(“[W]hen a plaintiff can acquire at least some information that would connect a defendant to the 
alleged wrongdoing, the ‘mere mention of the possibility’ of wrongdoing ‘cannot be enough.’” 
(quoting Citizens United, 882 F.3d at 385)).                              
    Nor do Plaintiffs show that their newfound allegation against SG “is based on factual 
information that makes the inference of culpability plausible.”  Artisa Recs. LLC, 604 F.3d at 


3    Plaintiffs provide no explanation for why, given their access to the whistleblower before 
their initial complaint, they did not include their new allegation in that complaint.  The lack of a 
new source to support the new allegation suggests that Plaintiffs are merely trying to repackage 
the same information to which they were privy in their initial pleading.  
120.  To do so, Plaintiffs would have to accompany their allegation with factual assertions that 
“raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Morana v. Park Hotels & Resorts, Inc., No. 
20-CV-2797 (RA), 2021 WL 1164010, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2021); see also, e.g., Warren v. 
ResMed Corp., No. 21-CV-8531 (JFK), 2022 WL 2334055, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2022) 

(“Because the Plaintiff’s allegation [upon information and belief] . . . is not accompanied by a 
statement of the facts upon which the belief is based, the [complaint] fails to state a claim . . . .” 
(cleaned up)).  But Plaintiffs offer only one factual averment to support their allegation: that 
BNC “is the primary financial institution with whom foreign companies do business in or with 
Cuba.”  SAC ¶ 40; see also Pls.’ Opp’n 10.  This is not enough.  First, it is not clear that 
“providing Cuban entities access to foreign currency” necessarily means that such funds flow 
through a Cuban bank.  SAC ¶ 40.  Plaintiffs point to no laws, regulations, or information from 
their whistleblower to support that inference.  Second, even if that inference were supportable, 
Plaintiffs cite nothing more than BNC’s share of the banking market in Cuba to support their 
next inference, that SG’s funds must have flowed through BNC.  Cf. Moreira, 573 F. Supp. 3d at 

929 (“[T]here is no indication that either Defendant renewed facilities available to BNC as 
opposed to other Cuban entities to which they made credit facilities available.”).  Plaintiffs’ 
reliance on market share, without more, however, “does not show that [their] belief is based on 
factual information that makes the inference of culpability plausible.”  Zeitlin, 532 F. Supp. 3d at 
71 (internal quotation marks omitted)).  In short, the “inference of culpability” here rests on not 
one, but two speculative assertions and, thus, fails to clear the plausibility threshold. 
    In short, Plaintiffs’ new post-2010 allegations against SG are not well pleaded and add 
nothing to what the Court considered in its prior Opinion and Order.  Thus, “[w]hen push comes 
to shove, ‘the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility 
of misconduct’ after 2010.”  Moreira, 573 F. Supp. 3d at 929 (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 
U.S. 662, 679 (2009)).  It follows that Plaintiffs’ claims against SG must be and are dismissed as 
untimely.                                                                 
B.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Against Paribas                                    

    As noted, Plaintiffs include two pertinent new allegations (or sets of allegations) as to 
Paribas: first, that Paribas transacted with a Cuban military-linked investment firm and other 
foreign companies that do business in Cuba and that, “[u]pon information and belief, BNC [was] 
involved in at least some of th[ose] transactions because it is the primary financial institution 
with whom foreign companies do business in or with Cuba,” SAC ¶ 56; and second, that 
“Paribas routinely provides to BNC in Switzerland parcels of U.S. currency,” that it did so in 
2020, and that there is “no reason to believe Paribas stopped,” id. ¶ 49.  The former does not do 
the trick for the reasons discussed above as to SG: The new allegations are conclusory and not 
well pleaded.  Thus, the question of whether Plaintiffs’ claims against Paribas can proceed turns 
on whether their allegation that Paribas provided cash to BNC in Switzerland cuts it. 

    The Court is not prepared to answer that question now because it implicates two issues 
that appear to be of first impression as to which the parties’ briefing is not well developed.  First, 
it is not clear that merely giving cash to BNC, without more, qualifies as “trafficking” within the 
meaning of the Helms-Burton Act, as broad as the definition of “trafficking” may be.  (The 
Second Amended Complaint does allege, “[u]pon information and belief,” that “BNC uses the 
U.S. currency provided by Paribas to continue to access international markets and conduct 
transactions, including on behalf of its clients, that it would not otherwise be able to access or 
conduct.”  SAC ¶ 49.  But that allegation is arguably not well pleaded either.)  Defendants do 
argue in passing that “the alleged delivery of cash to BNC, without more, falls far outside the 
definition of trafficking.”  Def.’s Mem. 14; see also id. at 22 (claiming, in a single sentence, that 
“the SAC’s new allegations that [Paribas] provided BNC U.S. currency fails to allege that 
[Paribas’s] transactions amount to trafficking”); ECF No. 84, at 6 (“There is no connection 
between the alleged ‘parcels of cash’ and any supposed credit facility with BNC or with 

Plaintiffs’ confiscated property.  In other words, this reference to BNC is far removed from any 
definition of ‘trafficking’ . . . .”).  But they do not develop the argument or discuss any relevant 
authority.  Plaintiffs devote even less ink to the issue, simply asserting that the deliveries 
“constitute trafficking in Banco Pujol property” whether or not they “are disbursements from a 
credit facility or payments on behalf of a Paribas client.”  Pls.’ Opp’n 11; see also id. at 18-21 
(never discussing the allegation specifically in the trafficking analysis). 
    Second, even if the delivery of cash to BNC in Switzerland constitutes trafficking within 
the meaning of the Helms-Burton Act, it is not clear that the Court can, consistent with New 
York law and due process, exercise personal jurisdiction over Paribas given that the only conduct 
alleged to have occurred in New York (or the United States) occurred long before the repose 

period.  See, e.g., Wilder v. News Corp., No. 11-CV-4947 (PGG), 2015 WL 5853763, at *11 n.6 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 2015) (“[C]laims premised on the[] [violative statements] are time-barred.  
Accordingly, these statements provide no basis for this Court to exercise specific personal 
jurisdiction over [the Defendant].”); Skidmore v. Led Zepplin, 106 F. Supp. 3d 581, 588 (E.D. Pa. 
2015) (“[T]he only acts alleged to have been performed by the individual Defendants in this 
District . . . occurred at least seventeen years ago.  Given the three-year statute of limitations . . . 
[these] are not contacts upon which the Court may base its exercise of specific jurisdiction.”).  
But see Power Density Sols. v. IBM Corp., No. 19-CV-3710, 2020 WL 4876895, at *4 (N.D. Cal. 
Mar. 20, 2020) (“[The Defendant’s] theory appears to be that if claims for the allegedly wrongful 
conduct in [the forum state] are all time-barred, then such conduct does not ‘count’ for purposes 
of jurisdictional analysis.  While creative, this theory has no support in law or logic.”).  That is 
true even if, as Plaintiffs contend, see Pls.’ Opp’n 12-14, Paribas’s pre-2010 conduct and its 
alleged deliveries of cash in Switzerland are properly viewed as a single, continuing act of 
“trafficking.”4  After all, the offending conduct in New York took place long ago, the recent 

conduct itself has no apparent connection to New York (or the United States), and there is reason 
to believe that Paribas structured its activities in the interim to avoid potential liability in New 
York and the United States.  The parties have not cited, and the Court has not found, any case 
addressing whether New York’s long-arm statute would apply in these unusual circumstances.  
And even if personal jurisdiction would be proper under New York law, it is far from clear 
whether, in these circumstances, it would be “reasonable” to exercise jurisdiction over Paribas as 
required by the Due Process Clause — that is, whether asserting jurisdiction over a non-
domiciliary that has, for over a decade (and for the entirety of the repose period), avoided any 
contact with New York (and the United States) “would comport with fair play and substantial 

justice.”  U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Bank of Am. N.A., 916 F.3d 143, 150-51 (2d Cir. 2019) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  On that issue too, the parties’ briefing does not sufficiently 
aid the Court.                                                            
                          CONCLUSION                                     
    For the forgoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED with respect to 
Plaintiffs’ claims against SG.  Further, because the Court previously granted Plaintiffs leave to 
amend and because Plaintiffs neither suggest that they have additional facts that would render 


4    To be clear, the Court does not need or want further briefing on that issue as the parties 
have already addressed it adequately.                                     
their claims against SG timely nor request leave to amend again, the Court declines to grant 
Plaintiffs another opportunity to amend.  See, e.g., Fischman v. Mitsubishi Chem. Holdings Am., 
Inc., No. 18-CV-8188 (JMF), 2019 WL 3034866, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. July 11, 2019).  By contrast, 
the Court reserves judgment with respect to Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims 
against Paribas pending further briefing on the issues discussed above, namely (1) whether 
Plaintiffs’ allegations that Paribas gave cash to BNC in Switzerland are sufficient to establish 
“trafficking” within the meaning of the Helms-Burton Act; and (2) if so, whether the assertion of 
personal jurisdiction over Paribas, under the unusual circumstances of this case, would be proper 
under New York law and consistent with due process.°  Plaintiffs and Paribas shall submit 
supplemental briefs on these issues, not to exceed fifteen pages, by February 6, 2023. 
      The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. 75 and to terminate SG as a party.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- X  
JESSE M. FURMAN, United States District Judge:                            
    This case is one of the first brought in this District under the Cuban Liberty and 
Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, 22 U.S.C. § 6021, et seq., commonly known as the Helms-
Burton Act (the “Act” or the “Helms-Burton Act”), which creates a private cause of action 
against those who “traffic” in assets that were confiscated by the Cuban government.  Although 
the Act went into effect in 1996, the right to bring a cause of action under it was suspended by 
presidential decree until May 2019, when President Trump lifted the suspension for the first 
time.  Shortly thereafter, Plaintiffs — heirs of the former owners of Banco Pujol, a Cuban bank 
confiscated by the Cuban government in 1960 — brought this suit, alleging that Defendants 
Société Générale (“SG”) and BNP Paribas (“Paribas”), both multinational banks, “trafficked” in 
their confiscated assets by arranging credit facilities for Banco National de Cuba (“BNC”), the 
Cuban national bank that absorbed Banco Pujol’s confiscated assets.       
    Defendants now move, pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims.  They raise various arguments, including that 
Plaintiffs lack standing under Article III of the Constitution and that Plaintiffs’ claims are time 
barred by the Act, which provides that an action “may not be brought more than 2 years after the 
trafficking giving rise to the action has ceased to occur.”  22 U.S.C. § 6084.  For the reasons that 
follow, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs do have constitutional standing but that their claims 

are indeed time barred.  Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss the 
Complaint for failure to state a claim, albeit with leave to amend.       
                         BACKGROUND                                      
    The Court begins with the relevant background, starting with the Helms-Burton Act and 
then turning to the facts specific to this case.  The latter are drawn from the Amended Complaint 
(“Complaint”), ECF No. 29 (“Compl.”) and assumed to be true for purposes of this motion.  See, 
e.g., Biro v. Conde Nast, 807 F.3d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 2015).               
A.  The Helms-Burton Act                                                  
    In 1996, seeking to strengthen the United States’ economic sanctions on Cuba and hasten 
the end of the Fidel Castro regime, Congress passed the Helms-Burton Act.  Congress observed 

that Cuba was “offering foreign investors the opportunity to purchase an equity interest in, 
manage, or enter into joint ventures,” oftentimes using property confiscated from United States 
nationals, and that these foreign investors were, in turn, providing Cuba with “badly needed 
financial benefit, including hard currency, oil, and productive investment and expertise.”  22 
U.S.C. § 6081(5), (6).  To deter these foreign investors and to “protect United States nationals 
against confiscatory takings and the wrongful trafficking in property confiscated by the Castro 
regime,” id. § 6022, Title III of the Act created a private cause of action, available to any United 
States national who owns a claim to property confiscated by the Cuban Government, against any 
person who intentionally “traffics” in such property, id. § 6082(a)(1)(A) (hereinafter “Title III”).   
    Under Title III, a person “traffics” in confiscated property if that person “knowingly and 
intentionally” “sells, transfers, distributes, dispenses, brokers, manages or otherwise disposes of 
confiscated property, or purchases, leases, receives, possesses, obtains control of, manages, uses, 
or otherwise acquires or holds an interest in confiscated property . . . [or] engages in a 

commercial activity using or otherwise benefiting from confiscated property,” or if that person 
“causes, directs, participates in, or profits from, trafficking . . . or otherwise engages in 
trafficking . . . through another person.”  Id. § 6023(13)(A).  As a remedy, claimants may seek 
the greater of the current market value of the property or the value at the time it was confiscated, 
plus interest, and may also seek treble damages if, inter alia, the trafficker continues to traffic in 
the confiscated property.  Id. § 6082(a)(1)(A), (a)(3)(B)-(C).            
    The enactment of Title III was not welcomed universally.  See, e.g., Havana Club 
Holding, S.A. v. Galleon S.A., 961 F. Supp. 498, 501 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (explaining, shortly 
after the Act’s passage, that Title III had been characterized as “objectionable and onerous to 
United States allies” and that some allies had responded to its passage with “nothing less than 

‘outrage’”).  Perhaps anticipating that reaction, Congress granted the President the power to 
suspend the private right of action created by Title III if he or she “determines . . . that 
suspension is necessary to the national interests of the United States and will expedite a 
transition to democracy in Cuba.” Id. § 6085(b).  Until May 2019, every President had exercised 
that power.  In May 2019, however, President Trump lifted the suspension, allowing Title III 
claims to proceed for the first time.  On November 9, 2020, this litigation followed.  ECF No. 1. 
B.  Factual Background                                                    
    In 1958, before Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba, Banco Pujol was the seventh largest 
Cuban owned bank, controlling $25.1 million in assets.  Compl. ¶ 25.  On October 14, 1960, the 
new Castro government confiscated Banco Pujol and absorbed the bank, along with other Cuban 
owned banks, into BNC.  Id. ¶ 26.  At the time, approximately 1.3% of BNC’s total equity came 
from the property seized from Banco Pujol.  Id. ¶ 28.                     
    Plaintiffs here are United States citizens (or the estates thereof) who inherited interests in 

Banco Pujol.  Id. ¶¶ 6-16, 25.  They bring claims under Title III against SG and Paribas, major 
multinational banks, for trafficking in confiscated Banco Pujol property.  Id. ¶¶ 36, 43, 61.  In 
particular, Plaintiffs allege that sometime after December 11, 1995, SG opened at least six credit 
facilities that made loans to BNC or to “a New-Jersey incorporated entity for subsequent transfer 
to” BNC.  Id. ¶¶ 36, 37.  They allege that between 2000 and 2010, Paribas operated “eight credit 
facilities” for Cuban banks and “opened U.S.-dollar accounts with Cuban banks,” including 
BNC, “to permit them access to U.S. dollars.”  Id. ¶ 43.                  
    Plaintiffs allege that the opening of these credit facilities, and loans made to BNC, 
constitute trafficking within the meaning of Title III because BNC “knowingly and 
intentionally . . . manag[ed], posess[ed], obtain[ed] control of, or otherwise acquir[ed] or [held] 

an interest in” and “used or benefited from” the property confiscated from Banco Pujol, and SG 
and Paribas “knowingly and intentionally participated in and profited from BNC’s trafficking in 
[the] confiscated property.”  Id. ¶ 39 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. ¶ 47.  
Through these facilities, Plaintiffs allege, SG and Paribas provided BNC with access to U.S. 
dollar credit facilities that it could not otherwise access and “earned significant profits from 
operating the . . . facilities.”  Id. ¶¶ 38, 39; see also id. ¶¶ 46, 47.    
    Plaintiffs allege that SG and Paribas also trafficked in property confiscated from Banco 
Pujol by “knowingly and intentionally engag[ing] in, participat[ing] in, and profit[ing] from 
commercial activities that used or otherwise benefited from confiscated property.”  Id. ¶ 40 
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. ¶ 48.  According to Plaintiffs, SG and Paribas 
benefited from the property confiscated from Banco Pujol because that property “made BNC a 
more stable, less risky, and more desirable counterparty than it otherwise would have been” for 
the credit facilities.  Id. ¶¶ 40, 48.  Finally, Plaintiffs allege that SG and Paribas “continue to 

traffic in” Banco Pujol’s confiscated property “in substantially the same manner” by 
“continu[ing] to operate similar credit facilities,” although the facilities now exclude U.S. dollar 
transactions.  Id. ¶¶ 54, 59.                                             
                       LEGAL STANDARD                                    
    Defendants move jointly to dismiss Plaintiffs’ Complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 
12(b)(6).  ECF No. 41 (“Defs.’ Mem.”) at 39.  A Rule 12(b)(1) motion challenges the court’s 
subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the case.  “A case is properly dismissed for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) when the district court lacks the statutory or 
constitutional power to adjudicate it.”  Makarova v. United States, 201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 
2000).  In reviewing a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), a court “must take all facts alleged 

in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff, but jurisdiction 
must be shown affirmatively, and that showing is not made by drawing from the pleadings 
inferences favorable to the party asserting it.”  Morrison v. Nat’l Austl. Bank Ltd., 547 F.3d 167, 
170 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), aff’d, 561 U.S. 247 (2010).  
“The plaintiff bears the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the 
evidence.”  Aurecchione v. Schoolman Transp. Sys., Inc., 426 F.3d 635, 638 (2d Cir. 2005). 
    By contrast, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint and requires 
a court to determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the 
plaintiff has a plausible claim for relief.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  When 
ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must accept the factual allegations set forth in the 
complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  See, e.g., Holmes v. 
Grubman, 568 F.3d 329, 335 (2d Cir. 2009).  To survive such a motion, however, the plaintiff 
must plead sufficient facts “to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. 

v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads 
factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.                     
                          DISCUSSION                                     
    Defendants advance a handful of arguments in support of dismissal.  The Court, however, 
reaches only two: first, whether Plaintiffs have standing, as that is a “threshold jurisdictional 
question” and cannot be assumed, Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102 
(1998); and second, whether Plaintiffs’ claims are timely.  The Court will address each in turn.  
A.  Standing                                                              
    Article III of the Constitution restricts the “judicial Power” of the United States to 

“Cases” and “Controversies.”  U.S. Const. art. III, § 2.  In light of that restriction, the Supreme 
Court has held that a plaintiff must have “standing” to sue.  See, e.g., Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l 
USA, 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013).  To have standing, a “plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury 
in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely 
to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 
(2016).  Significantly, each element “must be supported . . . with the manner and degree of 
evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.”  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 
555, 561 (1992).  At the pleading stage, as here, a plaintiff need only “clearly . . . allege facts 
demonstrating” each element.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 518 (1975).  
    Here, Plaintiffs allege that they suffered injuries sufficient to confer standing because 
Defendants “use[d], exploit[ed], and derive[d] benefits from their confiscated property, without 
their permission and without compensating them for the property’s use.”  ECF No. 48 (“Pls.’ 
Opp’n”) at 8-9.  In response, Defendants offer two arguments as to why these injuries are 

insufficient.  First, they contend that Plaintiffs allege only one true concrete injury, the 
confiscation of Banco Pujol, and it is not fairly traceable to Defendants’ conduct.  Defs.’ Mem. 
9-10.  Second, and relatedly, Defendants argue that to the extent Plaintiffs allege any injury that 
is fairly traceable to their trafficking in Plaintiffs’ confiscated property, that injury is a mere 
statutory violation and not sufficiently concrete to satisfy the constitutional requirements of 
Article III.  Id. at 11-12.  Neither argument is persuasive.              
    With respect to the first, Plaintiffs allege an injury from Defendants’ trafficking that is 
distinct from the confiscation of Banco Pujol by the Cuban Government.  For example, Plaintiffs 
allege that Defendants “engag[ed] in commercial activity with BNC, which has included and 
benefitted from the wrongfully confiscated assets of Banco Pujol since 1960,” Compl. ¶ 34; that 

Defendants “earned significant profits” from this activity, id. ¶¶ 38, 46; and that “Plaintiffs 
[n]ever consented to [Defendants’] trafficking in the confiscated property,” id. ¶¶ 41, 49.  As 
many courts that have considered similar claims have recently held, these kinds of injuries are 
distinct from the original confiscation and “fairly traceable” to the alleged trafficker.  See, e.g., 
Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Corporación CIMEX S.A., No. 19-CV-01277 (APM), 2021 WL 1558340, 
at *21 (D.D.C. Apr. 20, 2021) (“Congress has defined Exxon’s injury in terms of the effects of 
trafficking in the confiscated property, and that injury is plainly ‘fairly traceable’ to Defendants’ 
alleged trafficking.”); see also Glen v. Trip Advisor LLC, 529 F. Supp. 3d 316, 327-28 (D. Del. 
2021) (“Congress . . . observed that the rightful owners’ injury stemmed from both the Cuban 
government’s confiscation of the property and subsequent traffickers’ use of that confiscated 
property.”).  Put simply, Plaintiffs allege injury from Defendants’ “use” and “exploit[ation]” of 
their confiscated property.  Pls.’ Opp’n 8-9.  That harm is plainly traceable to Defendants’ setting 
up credit facilities for, and making loans to, BNC.                       

    With respect to the second argument — that Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries are insufficiently 
concrete to satisfy Article III — Defendants are, of course, correct that “‘a plaintiff [does not] 
automatically satisf[y] the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a 
statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.’”  Thole v. U. S. 
Bank N.A, 140 S. Ct. 1615, 1620 (2020) (quoting Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1549).  Plaintiffs 
must also allege a concrete injury in fact.  See id.  At the same time, the Supreme Court has 
explained that “‘[c]oncrete’ is not . . . necessarily synonymous with ‘tangible’” and that 
“Congress may elevate to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto injuries that 
were previously inadequate in law.”  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1549 (cleaned up).  In evaluating 
whether Congress has exercised that authority, a court must “consider whether an alleged 

intangible harm has a close relationship to a harm that has traditionally been regarded as 
providing a basis for a lawsuit in English or American courts.”  Id.; see also Maddox v. Bank of 
N.Y. Mellon Tr. Co., N.A., No. 19-1774, 2021 WL 5347004, at *4 (2d Cir. Nov. 17, 2021). 
    Doing so here, the Court concludes that Congress did indeed “elevate to the status of 
legally cognizable” a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a basis for a lawsuit 
in American courts: the harm of unjust enrichment.  “The equitable doctrine of unjust enrichment 
rests, generally, on the principle that a party should not be allowed to enrich himself at the 
expense of another.”  Reprosystem, B.V. v. SCM Corp., 727 F.2d 257, 263 (2d Cir. 1984).  In this 
case, the gravamen of Plaintiffs’ claims is that Defendants were unjustly enriched by the 
“significant profits” they earned based, in part, on Banco Pujol’s confiscated assets.  Compl. 
¶¶ 38, 46.  In fact, Congress itself recognized the relationship between unjust enrichment and 
claims under the statute, finding that “[t]he international judicial system, as currently structured, 
lacks fully effective remedies . . . for unjust enrichment from the use of wrongfully confiscated 

property by governments and private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the 
property.”  22 U.S.C. § 6081(8) (emphasis added); see also Glen v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 7 F.4th 
331, 334 (5th Cir. 2021) (“The harm allegedly caused by [the defendant’s] trafficking bears a 
close relationship to unjust enrichment, which has indisputable common-law roots.”).  
Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot state a claim for unjust enrichment because they no 
longer own Banco Pujol’s property, ECF No. 51 (“Defs.’ Reply”) at 3-4, but that argument 
misapprehends the analysis.  To establish standing, Plaintiffs need not bring an unjust 
enrichment claim or a claim that has identical elements; it suffices for them to allege a statutory 
violation that is closely related to “a harm that has traditionally been regarded as providing a 
basis for a lawsuit.”  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1549.  They do so.     

    In short, Plaintiffs have standing to pursue their claims under the Helms-Burton Act.  
Notably, in reaching that conclusion, the Court joins every other court that has addressed the 
issue in the wake of President Trump’s decision to lift the suspension.  See Glen, 7 F.4th at 336; 
N. Am. Sugar Indus. Inc. v. Xinjiang Goldwind Sci. & Tech. Co., No. 20-CV-22471 (DPG), 2021 
WL 3741647, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 24, 2021); Exxon Mobil Corp., 2021 WL 1558340, at *21; 
Glen, 529 F. Supp. 3d at 328; Havana Docks Corp. v. Carnival Corp., No. 19-CV-21724 (BB), 
2020 WL 5517590, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 14, 2020); Havana Docks Corp. v. MSC Cruises SA 
Co., 484 F. Supp. 3d 1177, 1195 (S.D. Fla. 2020); Havana Docks Corp. v. Norwegian Cruise 
Line Holdings, Ltd., 484 F. Supp. 3d 1215, 1231 (S.D. Fla. 2020); Iglesias v. Ricard, No. 20-CV-
20157 (KMW), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164117, at *29 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 17, 2020). 
B.  Timeliness                                                            
    With that, the Court turns to the merits of Plaintiffs’ claims.  Defendants make various 

alternative arguments for why Plaintiffs fail to state a claim, but the Court reaches only one: that 
Plaintiffs’ claims are time barred.  Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’ claims are untimely based 
on Section 6084 of the Helms-Burton Act, which provides that “[a]n action under section 6082 
of this title [i.e., for trafficking] may not be brought more than 2 years after the trafficking giving 
rise to the action has ceased to occur.”  22 U.S.C. § 6084.  Defendants argue that this time limit 
bars Plaintiffs’ claims because Plaintiffs fail to allege any trafficking that occurred in the two 
years prior to their filing suit in November 2020 and because the time limit is a statute of repose 
not subject to equitable exceptions.  Defs.’ Mem. 12-18.  Defendants point to allegations in the 
Complaint that “SocGen processed at least 2,500 transactions — valued at $13 billion — through 
New York financial institutions between 2004 and 2010,” Compl. ¶ 37, and that “from at least 

2000 to 2010, Paribas offered U.S.-dollar financing to Cuban entities,” id. ¶ 43.  Defendants 
contend that these allegations show that any trafficking ended in 2010, well outside the statutory 
time limit.                                                               
    Plaintiffs offer several responses.  First and most straightforward, they contend that their 
claims are timely because, in addition to the conduct through 2010, the Complaint alleges that 
Defendants “continue to traffic in Plaintiffs’ property in substantially the same manner” and that 
“[b]oth Defendants continue to operate similar credit facilities.”  Id. ¶ 54; accord id. ¶ 59; see 
Pls.’ Opp’n 26-27.  But when it comes to assessing timeliness, such conclusory assertions of 
“continuing” or “ongoing” conduct do not cut it.  See, e.g., Chiu v. Au, No. 03-CV-1150 (RNC), 
2005 WL 2452565, at *3 (D. Conn. Sept. 30, 2005) (holding that the plaintiff’s allegations “in 
conclusory terms that the defamation against him is ongoing” were “too vague to state a claim 
for relief that is not barred by the statute of limitations”); Broughton v. Livingston Indep. Sch. 
Dist., No. 08-CV-175 (TH), 2009 WL 10707489, at *6 (E.D. Tex. June 11, 2009) (same); cf. 

Shomo v. City of New York, 579 F.3d. 176, 181 (2d Cir. 2009) (“To trigger the continuing 
violation doctrine when challenging discrimination, the plaintiff must allege both the existence 
of an ongoing policy of discrimination and some non-time-barred acts taken in furtherance of 
that policy.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)); Gaughan v. Nelson, No. 94-
CV-3859 (JFK), 1997 WL 80549, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 1997) (holding that “a few non-
specific and conclusory allegations of” discriminatory conduct within the time limitation were 
not sufficient to establish timeliness under a continuing violations theory); see also generally 
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 678 (holding that “naked assertions devoid of further factual 
enhancement” are not sufficient to state a claim and that a court need not accept as true 
“conclusory statements” in a complaint (cleaned up)).                     

    Plaintiffs further argue that “Defendants’ own admissions support an inference of 
continued trafficking” because (1) Defendants previously disregarded U.S. criminal law in 
pursuit of profits related to the facilities; (2) Defendants “renewed [the] facilities in Euros” after 
facing liability in the United States; (3) BNC maintains an office in Paris to conduct business 
with French banks; and (4) Defendants did not affirmatively say, in response to Plaintiffs’ 
claims, that they had stopped trafficking in confiscated property.  Id. at 27-28.  But these 
arguments do not withstand scrutiny.  The fact that Defendants previously disregarded U.S. 
criminal law in connection with the facilities says nothing about whether they continued to do so 
during the limitations period.  So too, it is a non sequitur to suggest that Defendants continue to 
offer credit facilities to BNC simply because BNC has an office in Paris and Defendants are 
Paris-based banks.  And at this stage of the litigation, the mere fact that Defendants have not 
affirmatively denied Plaintiffs’ allegations does not mean that the allegations are plausible.  That 
leaves the alleged fact that Defendants “renewed,” ECF No. 29-2, at 47, or “converted,” ECF 

No. 29-3, at 51, the facilities into Euros.  See Compl. ¶¶ 54, 59.  The alleged renewals and 
conversions, however, happened in 2010.  ECF No. 29-2, at 47; ECF No. 29-3, at 51.  Moreover, 
there is no indication that either Defendant renewed facilities available to BNC as opposed to 
other Cuban entities to which they made credit facilities available.  See ECF No. 29-2, at 47 
(noting, with respect to some of the facilities, that SG “did not renew them at the end of their 
term”).1  When push comes to shove, “the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer 
more than the mere possibility of misconduct” after 2010.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679; see also 
Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 (noting that a complaint “must be dismissed” if “the plaintiffs . . . have 
not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible”).  
    Perhaps recognizing that their allegations of misconduct since 2010 are inadequate, 

Plaintiffs make a second argument: that, at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, dismissal based on timeliness 
is appropriate only if it is clear from “‘the face of the complaint’” that the claims are time-barred.  
Pls.’ Opp’n 26 (citing Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co. v. BioHealth Lab’ys, Inc., 988 F.3d 127, 132 (2d 
Cir. 2021)).  Defendants argue that is not the case here because the relevant provision is a statute 
of repose, not a statute of limitation, and thus timeliness is not an affirmative defense, but 
“‘defines the right.’”  Defs.’ Reply 9 (citing P. Stolz Family P’ship L.P. v. Daum, 355 F.3d 92, 


1    Defendants argue that, to the extent Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding non-U.S. dollar 
transactions would otherwise salvage their claims, “the action would still have to be dismissed 
under Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal jurisdiction.”  Defs.’ Mem. 18.  In light of the Court’s 
conclusions above, it need not and does not consider this alternative argument. 
102 (2d Cir. 2004)).  Relatedly, they cite cases for the proposition that “when the very statute 
which creates the cause of action also contains a limitation period, the plaintiff must plead and 
prove facts showing that he is within the statute.”  Mori v. Saito, 10-CV-6465 (KBF), 2013 WL 
1736527, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 19, 2013) (cleaned up).  But the Court need not and does not 

decide who has the better of that debate because, even if Plaintiffs are right, the doctrine provides 
them no relief.  That is because Plaintiffs — whether they were required to do so or not — 
explicitly allege that Defendants’ trafficking conduct ended more than a decade ago.  See Compl. 
¶ 37 (“SocGen processed at least 2,500 transactions — valued at $13 billion — through New 
York financial institutions between 2004 and 2010.”); id. ¶ 43 (“[F]rom at least 2000 to 2010, 
Paribas offered U.S.-dollar financing to Cuban entities.”).  Plaintiffs may be right that “‘no 
information’ [about timeliness] precludes dismissal,” Pls.’ Opp’n. 27 (quoting Fargas v. 
Cincinnati Mach., LLC, 986 F. Supp. 2d 420, 427 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)), but their Complaint has 
information — namely, the specific dates of Defendants’ alleged conduct.  That is, ignoring 
Plaintiffs’ conclusory allegations about “continuing” and “ongoing” conduct, as the Court must 

for the reasons discussed above, the Court is left with a Complaint that, on its face, does reveal 
the claims to be time barred.  See 5B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 1357 (3d ed.) (“[T]he inclusion of 
dates in the complaint indicating that the action is untimely renders it subject to dismissal for 
failure to state a claim.  This particularly is true if the action sued on is statutory in origin, 
because the bar of the statute of limitations then is said to extinguish not only the remedy but the 
underlying substantive right as well.” (footnotes omitted)).2             


2    Plaintiffs also cite Havana Docks Corp., 2020 WL 5517590.  See Pls.’ Opp’n 26.  But 
there, the court concluded that the plaintiff had alleged both instances of trafficking that had 
occurred in the prior two years and older instances.  Id. at *11.  In that context, the court noted 
that “the Amended Complaint sets forth only one count, sues only one defendant, and alleges 
trafficking relating to one Subject Property and linked to one Certified Claim” and “reject[ed] the 
    That leaves only Plaintiffs’ final argument: that the time bar in Section 6084 was tolled 
— either equitably or per the statute’s terms — during the time that Title III was suspended at 
the direction of the President (i.e., until 2019).  Pls.’ Opp’n 28-33.  Whether equitable tolling is 
available turns in the first instance on whether Section 6084 is a statute of limitation or a statute 

of repose, as the Supreme Court has made clear that statutes of repose are “in general not subject 
to tolling.”  Cal. Pub. Emps.’ Ret. Sys. v. ANZ Sec., Inc., 137 S. Ct. 2042, 2050 (2017).  Instead, 
“[t]olling is permissible only where there is a particular indication that the legislature did not 
intend the statute to provide complete repose but instead anticipated the extension of the 
statutory period under certain circumstances.”  Id.; see also Police & Fire Ret. Sys. of City of 
Detroit v. IndyMac MBS, Inc., 721 F.3d 95, 106 (2d Cir. 2013) (“[A] statute of repose is subject 
only to legislatively created exceptions, and not to equitable tolling.” (cleaned up)); accord 
United States ex rel. Wood v. Allergan, Inc., No. 19-CV-4029 (JMF), 2020 WL 3073293, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. June 10, 2020).  Defendants argue that Section 6084 is a statute of repose and, 
therefore, not subject to equitable tolling.  Defs.’ Mem. 12.  Plaintiffs counter that Section 6084 

is a statute of limitations and that it was equitably tolled.  Pls.’ Opp’n 31-32. 
    Defendants have the better of the argument.  The time limitation in Section 6084 runs 
from the date “the trafficking giving rise to the action has ceased to occur.”  22 U.S.C. § 6084.  
In other words, it runs from “the defendant’s last culpable act[,] . . . not from the accrual of the 
claim.”  Cal. Pub. Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 137 S. Ct. at 2049.  That alone is a “close to a dispositive 


notion that Plaintiff’s single-count Amended Complaint is actionable only as to certain 
allegations but not as to others.”  Id.  The situation here is different because Plaintiffs, as 
described above, do not adequately allege any timely claims of trafficking.  The Court need not 
and does not consider whether, had Plaintiffs alleged some timely claims, it would be 
permissible to consider Defendants’ actions since setting up the credit facilities as a single act of 
trafficking.                                                              
indication that the statute is one of repose.”  Id.  Moreover, by bluntly providing that a trafficking 
action “may not be brought” more than two years after a defendant’s last culpable act, Section 
6084 “admits of no exception and on its face creates a fixed bar against future liability.”  Id.  
Finally, one of Congress’s primary purposes in passing the Helms-Burton Act was to strengthen 

sanctions on the Cuban government by deterring foreign investors from doing business with 
Cuba.  See 22 U.S.C. § 6081(5), (6); see also id. § 6082(a)(1)(A) (providing that companies 
would not be subject to liability if they ceased trafficking within three months of the Act’s 
effective date).  That goal is better served by a statute of repose, which gives investors an 
incentive to cease doing business with Cuba by making them “free from liability after the 
legislatively determined period of time.”  CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U.S. 1, 9 (2014).  Thus, 
Section 6084 is more naturally read to be a statute of repose.            
    Plaintiffs offer no persuasive argument to the contrary.  They argue that the date on 
which “the trafficking giving rise to that action has ceased to occur,” 22 U.S.C. § 6084, is also 
“the date on which the plaintiff last suffered an injury,” Pls.’ Opp’n 32, but the Supreme Court 

has explained that “limitations periods begin to run when the cause of action accrues,” Cal. Pub. 
Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 137 S. Ct. at 2049 (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added), not 
“the date on which the plaintiff has suffered an injury,” Pls.’ Opp’n 32.  Here, the cause of action 
would have accrued much earlier, when Defendants first trafficked in Plaintiffs’ property, which 
Plaintiffs allege to be 2000 and 2004, respectively.  Compl. ¶¶ 37, 43; see also 22 U.S.C. 
6082(a)(1)(A) (providing that a cause of action accrues as soon as the defendant “traffics in 
property”).  Plaintiffs also argue that where a statute is one of repose, “the injury need not have 
occurred” before repose is given.  Pls.’ Opp’n 32 (quoting CTS Corp., 573 U.S. at 8).  That is 
true (because a statute of repose is keyed to the defendant’s conduct, not the plaintiff’s injury), 
but it does not follow that where the injury has already occurred, the time limit must be a statute 
of limitations and not a statute of repose.  Plaintiffs further argue that Congress’s intent was to 
“provid[e] victims with a judicial remedy” and that that goal is best served by treating Section 
6084 as a statute of limitations.  Pls.’ Opp’n 33 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that goal 

is also served by a statute of repose, which, in addition to providing finality to defendants, “also 
encourage[s] plaintiffs to bring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the same reasons [as 
a statute of limitations].”  CTS Corp., 573 U.S. at 9.  Finally, Plaintiffs argue that Section 6084 
does not include “categorical language” such as “in no event.” Pls.’ Opp’n 33.  But, as 
Defendants rightly point out, many statutes of repose do not.  Defs.’ Reply 7 (citing 29 U.S.C. 
§ 1113(1) and other examples).                                            
    In the alternative, Plaintiffs argue that, under the statute itself, any time during which the 
right to bring suit under Section 6082 is “suspend[ed]” by the President is excluded from the 
time in which suit must be brought under Section 6084.  Pls.’ Opp’n 29 (citing 22 U.S.C. 
§ 6085(c)(1)-(2), (d)).  Plaintiffs contend that “suspend” in Section 6085(b) should be read to 

mean “toll,” such that any cause of action that accrues during a presidential suspension is 
delayed until the suspension is lifted.  Plaintiffs contrast Section 6085 with the language in 
Section 6082(h), which provides that “[a]ll rights created under this section . . . shall cease” upon 
a determination that a democratically elected government has come to power in Cuba.  Id. at 29-
30 (quoting 22 U.S.C. § 6082(h)).  Had Congress intended a suspension to foreclose claims 
where more than two years had lapsed, Plaintiffs assert, Congress would have made that clear as 
it did in Section 6082(h).  Finally, Plaintiffs point to statements made by the President and 
executive branch officials after the Act was adopted, to the effect that “liability would be 
established irreversibly during the suspension period” and that during the suspension period, 
“liability accrues” and “can’t be extinguished subsequently.”  Pls.’ Opp’n 30 (first quoting 
President Statement on Helms-Burton Waiver Exercise, 1996 WL 396122, at *1-2 (July 16, 
1996), then quoting Briefing on Helms-Burton Act Title III Suspension, 1996 WL 396125, at *5 
(July 16, 1996) (hereinafter “Briefing”)).                                

    The Court is not persuaded.  “When interpreting a statute,” a court must “begin with the 
text.  [It] must give effect to the text’s plain meaning, . . . [which] draws on the specific context 
in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.  Where the 
plain meaning of the text is clear, [the] inquiry generally ends there.”  Jingrong v. Chinese Anti-
Cult World All. Inc., 16 F.4th 47, 57 (2d Cir. 2021) (cleaned up).  Here, the meaning of the 
relevant text, Section 6085(c)(1)(B), is plain.  It provides only that “the President may suspend 
the right to bring an action” under the Act (if the President makes certain findings and reports to 
Congress) and makes no reference to Section 6084 or the time within which a plaintiff must 
bring an action in the first instance.  22 U.S.C. § 6085(c)(1)(B).  By contrast, Congress did 
explicitly provide elsewhere in the statute that a suspension of actions “shall not affect suits 

commenced before the date of such suspension.”  Id. § 6085(c)(3).  That provision shows that 
Congress “knew how to” make clear when suspension pursuant to Section 6085(c)(1)(B) would 
not affect a cause of action under Title III and that Congress “chose not to do so” with respect to 
causes of action that would be barred by Section 6084.  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. MacLean, 574 
U.S. 383, 394 (2015); see, e.g., Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (“[W]here 
Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of 
the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the 
disparate inclusion or exclusion.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).   
    This reading is reinforced by the fact, noted above, that one of Congress’s principal 
purpose in enacting Title III — as evidenced by the three-month safe harbor in Section 
6082(a)(1)(A) — was not to maximize victim compensation, but rather to compel companies to 
cease doing business with Cuba on the theory that doing so would hasten the fall of the Castro 

regime.  See 22 U.S.C. § 6081(6) (“‘[T]rafficking’ in confiscated property provides badly needed 
financial benefit . . . to the current Cuban Government and thus undermines the foreign policy of 
the United States . . . to bring democratic institutions to Cuba through the pressure of a general 
economic embargo at a time when the Castro regime has proven to be vulnerable to international 
economic pressure.”); see also Havana Club Holding, S.A., 961 F. Supp. at 501 (“The [Helms-
Burton] Act has further tightened the embargo in . . . [an] attempt to topple the Castro regime.”).  
Barring liability more than two years after the last date of trafficking advances that purpose 
because it provides putative defendants an unequivocal incentive to cease the conduct that 
Congress aimed to deter.  By contrast, Plaintiffs’ reading of the statute would undermine that 
goal.  Knowing that they would continue to face liability for an additional two years after a 

suspension was lifted, without regard for when they ceased trafficking, traffickers would have 
little incentive to cease trafficking any time during a suspension.  In other words, traffickers 
would be incentivized to continue trafficking until the day the suspension was lifted.  That is not 
the result that Congress intended.                                        
    Plaintiffs’ counterarguments fall short.  First, it is immaterial that “the terms ‘toll’ and 
‘suspend’” are “interchangeabl[e].”  Artis v. D.C., 138 S. Ct. 594, 601-02 (2018), quoted at Pls.’ 
Opp’n 29.  The question here is what a presidential suspension tolls.  By the statute’s terms, the 
answer is “the right to bring an action,” 22 U.S.C. § 6085(c)(1)(B), not the time bar in Section 
6084.  Second, Section 6082(h) — which provides that “[a]ll rights created under this section . . . 
shall cease” upon a determination that a democratically elected government has come to power 
in Cuba — actually cuts against Plaintiffs’ reading of the statute because it makes plain that 
Congress’s principal purpose was to bring about regime change in Cuba (by forcing companies 
to cease doing business there), not to maximize victim compensation.  Finally, statements by the 

President and other executive branch officials cannot, of course, alter the plain meaning of a 
statute.  Cf. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) 
(providing that no deference should be given to an executive branch agency’s interpretation of a 
statute where “the intent of Congress is clear” because “the court, as well as the agency, must 
give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress”).  In any event, the statements at 
issue, considered in context, refer only to the fact that the executive branch’s initial strategy was 
“to allow Title III to come into effect” while “suspend[ing] for a six-month period the right to 
file individual suits,” giving the executive branch time to “work vigorously with allies and with 
foreign companies to build support for a series of steps to promote democracy in Cuba.”  
Briefing, 1996 WL 396125 at *2.  There is no indication that the speakers envisioned the 

suspension lasting for twenty-three more years.  And regardless, nothing in the statements speaks 
to the implications of the suspension with respect to Section 6084.       
    In short, the Court concludes that Section 6084 was not tolled by the suspensions of Title 
III.  Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed above, Plaintiffs’ claims are untimely. 
                          CONCLUSION                                     
    For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED on the ground 
that Plaintiffs’ claims are time barred under Section 6084.  Nevertheless, mindful that leave to 
amend a complaint should be freely given “when justice so requires,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), 
and that it is “within the sound discretion of the district court to grant or deny leave to amend,” 
Ahmed v. GEO USA LLC, No. 14-CV-7486 (JMF), 2015 WL 1408895, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 
2015) (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court exercises its discretion and grants Plaintiffs’ 
request for leave to amend.  Pls.’ Opp’n 8 n.1.  Plaintiffs may not be able to cure the defects in 
their claims — after all, if they could have alleged in non-conclusory fashion that Defendants’ 
alleged trafficking continued beyond 2010, one assumes they would have — but the Court 
concludes they should be given a chance to do so with the benefit of this Opinion and Order. 
See, e.g., Loreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, 797 F.3d 160, 191 (2d Cir. 
2015).  Plaintiffs shall file any Second Amended Complaint within thirty days of the date of 
this Opinion and Order.  If Plaintiffs do so, the Court will convene a conference to discuss next 
steps, mindful that the parties have already briefed Defendants’ other arguments for dismissal (as 
to which the Court intimates no view here).  If Plaintiffs fail to file  a Second Amended 
Complaint by the deadline, the Court will dismiss the case without further notice.  The Clerk of 
Court is directed to terminate ECF No. 40.
