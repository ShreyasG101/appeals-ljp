 RELIANCE STANDARD LIFE                    AND REJECTING IN PART
 INSURANCE COMPANY,                             REPORT AND
                                             RECOMMENDATION
                                                (ECF NO. 19)
                   Defendant.

      This matter is before the Court on Magistrate Judge Elizabeth A.
Stafford’s   Report    and      Recommendation    of   January    27,   2023
recommending that Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment (ECF No.

10) be denied and that Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (ECF
No. 11) be granted. For the reasons that follow, Judge Stafford’s Report
and Recommendation will be accepted in part and rejected in part. Judge

Stafford’s conclusion that McEachin was not disabled by a physical
condition as of April 2021 will be accepted and adopted. Judge Stafford’s
conclusion that McEachin has exhausted the policy’s 24-month limit on

benefits for mental conditions as of April 2021 will be rejected.
                                I. BACKGROUND
      Plaintiff McEachin was covered under a long-term disability

insurance policy issued by Defendant Reliance Standard Life. Under the

                                      1
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3857 Filed 03/23/23 Page 2 of 19




policy, McEachin would be entitled to benefits if she became “totally
disabled,” that is, if she could not ‘perform the material duties of [her]

Regular Occupation.” Record, ECF No. 9, PageID.24, 35. McEachin’s
“regular occupation” was the job she was “routinely performing” when
her disability began: in this case, McEachin served as a human resources

manager. Id. at PageID.34, 575-576.
      On February 7, 2017, McEachin was in a car accident. Id. at
PageID.527. She stopped working immediately. Id. McEachin was

approved for disability benefits beginning on May 8, 2017 based on
“Head, Neck, Back pain and headaches due to whiplash/post-concussion
syndrome.” Id. at PageID.424, 587. In December, 2017, McEachin was

involved in a second car crash. Id. at PageID.553. In October, 2019,
McEachin sought behavioral health treatment after her son died by
suicide. Id. at PageID.555.

      On October 29, 2020, Reliance terminated McEachin’s benefits.
ECF No. 9, PageID.526. Reliance had reviewed medical records from
2017 through 2020, including updated medical records from McEachin’s

treating physicians in 2020. Id. at PageID.527-30. McEachin appealed
Reliance’s decision and submitted supplemental medical information. Id.
at PageID.533. On November 23, 2020, Reliance concluded that the new

information showed that McEachin was totally disabled, and reopened
her benefits claim. Id.


                                      2
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3858 Filed 03/23/23 Page 3 of 19




      On April 1, 2021, Reliance again terminated McEachin’s benefits
after reviewing updated medical records. Id. at PageID.537-40.

McEachin appealed once again and submitted additional documents. Id.
at PageID.546. Reliance referred McEachin’s claim to two independent
physicians who prepared reports. Id. at PageID.558-562. In light of those

reports and McEachin’s entire file, Reliance found that McEachin was
not precluded by physical disability from performing her regular
occupation. While Reliance concluded that McEachin was totally disabled

as a result of psychological conditions, it did not authorize benefits
because it determined that she had already exhausted the policy’s 24-
month maximum duration for benefits due to a mental condition. Id. at

PageID.559-60, 563.
      Because it concluded that she was not disabled by a physical
condition and had already exhausted the 24-month limit on benefits for

disabilities caused by a mental condition, Reliance upheld its decision to
terminate McEachin’s benefits in October, 2021. Id. at PageID.563.
      McEachin filed this suit about a month and a half later. See Compl.,

ECF No. 1. The undersigned referred the parties’ cross-motions for
summary judgment to Magistrate Judge Elizabeth A. Stafford for a
Report and Recommendation. Judge Stafford issued a report and

recommendation on January 27, 2023, recommending that the Court
deny McEachin’s motion and grant Reliance’s motion. McEachin has


                                      3
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3859 Filed 03/23/23 Page 4 of 19




objected to that report and recommendation, and Reliance responded to
McEachin’s objections.
                        II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
      The law provides that either party may serve and file written
objections “[w]ithin fourteen days after being served with a copy” of the

report and recommendation. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). Plaintiff timely
objected. Objections, ECF No. 20, 21. This Court must conduct a de novo
review of the parts of a report and recommendation to which a party

objects. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). “A judge of the court may accept, reject,
or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by
the magistrate judge. The judge may also receive further evidence or

recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.” Id.
                               III. ANALYSIS
         a. Plaintiff’s Objection 1
      First, McEachin argues that Judge Stafford applied the wrong

standard in evaluating the reports and conclusions of the doctors who
examined McEachin’s file on Reliance’s behalf. McEachin argues that
Judge Stafford effectively applied the more deferential “arbitrary and

capricious” standard, based on her citation to Edwards v. Metro. Life Ins.
Co., 737 F. Supp. 2d 743 (E.D. Mich. 2010) and Mellian v. Hartford Life
& Accident Ins. Co., 161 F. Supp. 3d 545 (E.D. Mich. 2016)—cases that

evaluated file reviewers’ opinions under an arbitrary and capricious
standard rather than the de novo standard that properly applies here.

                                      4
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3860 Filed 03/23/23 Page 5 of 19




Accordingly, McEachin argues, Judge Stafford may have given too much
deference to Reliance’s file reviewers, accepting their reports even if they

were merely “adequate,” rather than conducting the required de novo
review to determine whether Reliance made the right decision. Reliance
responds that Judge Stafford recognized that her review was de novo,

thoroughly examined the reviewing physicians’ statements, and did not
afford them any deference.
      Judge Stafford briefly mentioned Edwards, Mellian, and the factors

that courts use when applying the arbitrary and capricious standard to
file reviews: that “file reviews may support an unfavorable benefits
decision of they are reasonable and based on the evidence,” and that a

file review is “adequate” if it describes the data reviewed, does not reach
incredible conclusions, and does not ignore evidence favorable to the
plaintiff. See Report and Recommendation, ECF No. 19, PageID.3803,

3807 (citation and internal marks omitted).
      But it is clear that Judge Stafford applied the appropriate de novo
standard in considering whether the plan determination was correct.

Judge Stafford explained that her review was de novo, and noted that the
task before her was to “take into account all of the medical evidence,
giving each doctor’s opinion weight in accordance with the supporting

medical tests and objective findings that underlie the opinion.” ECF No.
19, PageID.3802 (citation omitted). And although she considered the
factors discussed in Edwards, determining that Reliance’s file reviewers
                                      5
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3861 Filed 03/23/23 Page 6 of 19




described the data reviewed, considered evidence favorable to McEachin,
and did not reach “incredible” conclusions, Judge Stafford did not

automatically accept the opinions of those file reviewers just because they
satisfied the Edwards factors. And indeed, considering those aspects of
the file reviewers’ opinions is helpful, even when evaluating the

reviewers’ credibility on a de novo review.
      Instead, Judge Stafford weighed the opinions of the doctors who
reviewed McEachin’s file against those of the doctors who treated her.

Judge Stafford noted that the opinions she found not credible were
“conclusory and unsupported by objective findings.” ECF No. 19,
PageID.3810-11. Explaining why she credited the opinions of Reliance’s

reviewers over McEachin’s treating doctors, Judge Stafford stated that
“the treating physicians’ opinions that [McEachin was] disabled lacked
detail about her functional limitations and the objective evidence

supporting her alleged disabling limitations.” Id. at PageID.3809.
      Judge Stafford clearly understood that the proper standard of
review required the court to evaluate and weigh the opinions of the

various treating and examining doctors to determine whether or not
McEachin could perform her regular occupation, and not merely to accept
the opinions of Reliance’s reviewers so long as they were “adequate.”

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s first objection is no reason to reject Judge
Stafford’s recommendation.

         b. Plaintiff’s Objection 2
      Next, McEachin objects to Judge Stafford’s conclusion that

McEachin’s condition “improved during the relevant time period.”
Objections, ECF No. 21, PageID.3834. McEachin does not appear to
dispute that her condition improved during the period Judge Stafford

considered. Rather, she argues that Judge Stafford looked at the wrong
period. McEachin casts the relevant timeframe as April 1, 2020 (the
initial termination of McEachin’s benefits) to October 8, 2021 (when

Reliance affirmed its initial denial). McEachin argues that she
underwent an additional spinal surgery during this period, belying the
conclusion that her condition improved.

      Reliance responds that the relevant time period begins much
earlier, and that what matters is that McEachin’s condition had begun
improving prior to Reliance’s denial of benefits. Reliance argues that it is

immaterial whether McEachin’s condition worsened after Reliance
initially denied benefits in April, 2021.
      Judge Stafford appropriately limited her analysis to the period

before April, 2021. In Likas v. Life Ins. Co. Of North America, the Sixth
Circuit considered this issue. 347 F. App’x 162, 167 (6th Cir. 2009). The
policy at issue in Likas provided that disability benefits would terminate

on “[t]he date [the plan administrator] determines an Employee is not
Disabled.” Id. So too here, where the plan provides that benefits will stop
on the earlier of the date that the insured “ceases to be Totally Disabled;”

                                      7
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3863 Filed 03/23/23 Page 8 of 19




or “fails to furnish the required proof of Total Disability.” ECF No. 9,
PageID.43.

      As the Sixth Circuit explained, under such a plan, “because [a]
plaintiff must show continuous disability and because coverage ends
when a disability ends, any deterioration in health after the date

coverage is denied is not relevant.” Likas, 347 F. App’x at 167-68.
Accordingly, the appropriate time period here is the period from the date
Reliance approved McEachin’s initial disability claim in 2017 to April,

2021, when Reliance denied McEachin’s claim.
      Judge Stafford focused her analysis on the appropriate period, and
her conclusion that McEachin’s condition improved during that time is

well supported by the record. As Judge Stafford noted, McEachin’s
medical records reflect improvement in her condition between mid-2020
and early 2021. In July, 2020, McEachin told Dr. Hatch that she felt “so

much better” after her January spinal surgery and could walk without a
limp, although she was “not 100%.” ECF No. 9-2, PageID.2075.
      A re-evaluation report prepared on March 24, 2021 reflected that

McEachin had participated in nineteen physical therapy sessions over
the preceding two months. ECF No. 9-3, PageID.2283. During those
sessions, McEachin “demonstrate[d] improved exercise tolerance,

increased strength [and] endurance.” Id. McEachin also reported
decreased pain. Id. As Judge Stafford noted, the records further show


                                      8
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3864 Filed 03/23/23 Page 9 of 19




that McEachin’s function improved in various other areas. ECF No. 19,
PageID.3808.

      Beginning in July, 2019, McEachin also reported that her migraine
headaches were improving somewhat. ECF No. 9-2. PageID.1697.
McEachin reported that Botox treatments were improving the “severity

but not frequency of her headaches.” Id. In early 2021, McEachin stated
that she had had “significant improvement in her headaches” due to a
combination of several medications and Botox injections, and was now

experiencing ten headaches per month that were less severe than in the
past. ECF No. 9-3, PageID.2378.
      Judge Stafford analyzed the appropriate time period and correctly

concluded that, during that time, McEachin’s symptoms improved.
         c. Plaintiff’s Objection 3
      McEachin’s third objection is to Judge Stafford’s finding that

McEachin’s treating physicians’ opinions lacked detail about her
functional limitations. McEachin contends that Dr. Bono issued a
“thoroughly reasoned, detailed and objectively supported” opinion. ECF

No. 21, PageID.3835. McEachin does not offer argument about the
opinions of her other treating doctors.
      Reliance concedes in response that Dr. Bono’s opinion was detailed

and reasoned, but argues that Judge Stafford rightly concluded that the
opinions of McEachin’s other doctors were unsupported by objective
evidence. Reliance also argues that Judge Stafford rightly found

                                      9
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3865 Filed 03/23/23 Page 10 of 19




 unsupported Dr. Bono’s opinion that McEachin would need to lie down
 periodically.

       Judge Stafford appropriately found that the opinions of Doctors
 Kutcher and Hatch were conclusory and lacked detail. Dr. Kutcher’s one-
 page opinion did not tie McEachin’s diagnosis to any tests or

 examinations, and merely opined that she was unable to work due to her
 diagnoses. ECF No. 9-5, PageID.3585. As Judge Stafford observed, Dr.
 Hatch’s opinion presents similar problems. Id. at PageID.3647.

       With respect to Dr. Bono, Judge Stafford weighed his opinion
 against those of Reliance’s reviewers. Judge Stafford did not ignore or
 arbitrarily discount Dr. Bono’s opinion, but concluded that those of

 Reliance’s      doctors   were   more   persuasive.   And   Judge   Stafford
 appropriately concluded that Dr. Bono did not explain his opinion that
 McEachin would need to lie down regularly for hours at a time.

       Ultimately, this Objection is more directed at the relative weight
 that Judge Stafford assigned to each of the treating and reviewing
 doctors’ opinions. As Judge Stafford noted, under ERISA, treating

 physicians’ opinions are not automatically entitled to any special weight.
 Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, 538 U.S. 822, 834 (2003). In any
 event, the appropriateness of Judge Stafford’s comparative weighting is

 addressed below with respect to Plaintiff’s fifth objection.




                                         10
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3866 Filed 03/23/23 Page 11 of 19




          d. Plaintiff’s Objection 4
       Next, McEachin objects to Judge Stafford’s finding that Reliance

 actually reviewed the opinions of McEachin’s treating doctors, Doctors
 Bono, Kutcher, and Hatch. She says that Reliance’s final termination
 letter ignored those opinions, and indeed misrepresented the record by

 stating that McEachin had not been subject to any activity restrictions.
 Reliance says that it reviewed and discussed those opinions in detail in
 its denial letter, and argues that McEachin has quoted the denial letter

 out of context with respect to activity restrictions.
       In its denial letter, Reliance specifically said that it had reviewed
 the opinions of Doctors Bono, Kutcher, and Hatch. ECF No. 9,

 PageID.551. Across some thirteen pages, Reliance described in detail the
 medical records supplied by these doctors and noted their conclusions. Id.
 at PageID.551-563. Reliance also described in detail the reports of file

 reviewers Doctors Grattan, Dlugach, and Glass. Id. Those file reviewers
 considered and rejected the conclusions of the treating doctors McEachin
 identifies. Judge Stafford correctly concluded that Reliance considered

 the opinions of McEachin’s treating doctors.
       McEachin also argues that Reliance misrepresented the record by
 stating that “You (Plaintiff) . . . were not ordered any activity

 restrictions.” ECF No. 21, PageID.3838 (citing ECF No. 9, PageID.557).
 The language about which McEachin complains appears in the middle of
 a paragraph discussing new medical records that McEachin provided

                                      11
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3867 Filed 03/23/23 Page 12 of 19




 after Reliance’s April 2021 denial. Throughout same letter, Reliance
 acknowledges that McEachin’s doctors ordered activity restrictions. See,

 e.g., ECF No. 9, PageID.552 (“You were not to lift greater than twenty
 pounds or work above shoulder level.”); Id. at PageID.554 (“You were to
 resume wearing a collar while using a computer.”). And all of Reliance’s

 file reviewers concluded that, if she were to return to full-time work,
 McEachin could only do so with limitations. Id. at PageID.558-59.
 Accordingly, the Court is not persuaded that Reliance misinterpreted the

 record, because its own file reviewers acknowledged that, if McEachin
 could work at all, it would only be with restrictions. Instead, it appears
 that Reliance concluded that the new records provided by McEachin after

 Reliance’s denial did not reflect any new restrictions or limitations.
       Plaintiff’s fourth objection presents no grounds to prevent this
 Court from accepting Judge Stafford’s recommendation.
          e. Plaintiff’s Objection 5
       McEachin’s     fifth   objection    is   to   how   the   Report   and
 Recommendation weighed the various doctors’ opinions. Reliance

 contends that McEachin has impermissibly raised a broad disagreement
 with Judge Stafford’s overall conclusion. To be sure, a general
 disagreement with a magistrate judge’s legal analysis or objection to the

 entire report is not a cognizable objection. Brown v. City of Grand Rapids,
 Michigan, 2017 WL 4712064, at *2 (6th Cir. June 16, 2017). But



                                      12
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3868 Filed 03/23/23 Page 13 of 19




 McEachin has not made such an objection. Her arguments are
 sufficiently specific to allow the Court to rule on them.

       McEachin argues that she furnished Reliance with ample evidence
 of a physical disability. She points to diagnostic tests, the opinions of
 Doctors Bono, Kutcher, and Hatch, and her need for a third spinal

 surgery all after April 2, 2021. McEachin contends that all of this
 demonstrates a deterioration in her condition. ECF No. 21, PageID.3838-
 39. McEachin points to a cervical spine scan at the end of May 2021 that

 revealed an “incomplete fusion of the posterior CI arch,” a consultation
 with Dr. Bono in August 2021 in which he opined that the “incomplete
 fusion” was causing McEachin’s pain and recommended surgery, and the

 C4-C7 decompression surgery performed by Dr. Bono in October 2021.
 ECF No. 21, PageID.3839. McEachin also highlights the opinions of
 Doctors Kutcher and Hatch in August, 2021.

       The central problem with McEachin’s argument is that it overlooks
 the Sixth Circuit’s instruction, discussed above, that “because coverage
 ends when a disability ends, any deterioration in health after the date

 coverage is denied is not relevant.” White v. Standard Ins. Co., 895 F.
 Supp. 2d 817, 851 (E.D. Mich. 2012), aff’d, 529 F. App’x 547 (6th Cir.
 2013) (quoting Likas, 347 at 167-68). The evidence to which McEachin

 points all postdates the April 2021 date on which Reliance terminated
 her benefits. Accordingly, evidence of McEachin’s October surgery does
 Not bear on the question of her eligibility for benefits in April.
                                      13
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3869 Filed 03/23/23 Page 14 of 19




       Just as Judge Stafford concluded, the evidence available before
 April, 2021 supports the conclusion that McEachin no longer satisfied the

 Plan’s definition of total disability due to a physical impairment. As
 discussed above, diagnostic tests and self-reported symptoms show that
 McEachin’s condition was improving in early 2021. After physical

 therapy, McEachin reported increased physical capabilities and
 decreased pain. ECF No. 9-3, PageID.2283. And McEachin’s migraine
 headaches responded to her medication regimen, decreasing in frequency

 and intensity. ECF Nos. 9-2, PageID.1697; 9-3, PageID.2378-79; ECF No.
 9-5, PageID.3586.
       Finally,   Reliance’s    reviewers,    particularly   Dr.    Grattan,

 acknowledged and incorporated into their opinions that McEachin still
 experienced significant pain and difficulty sitting or standing for
 prolonged periods. However, they did not go as far as Dr. Bono, who

 concluded that McEachin would need to lie down several times during
 the day for periods of longer than an hour. ECF No. 9-5, PageID.3632.
 But Dr. Bono did not explain with particularity why McEachin could not

 return to any sedentary role even with accommodations, or why she
 would need to lie down frequently. The opinions of Doctors Grattan and
 Glass—that McEachin could return to sedentary work with appropriate

 limitations—are persuasive. McEachin has not shown that she was
 totally disabled due to a physical impairment, prior to the April, 2021
 termination of benefits.
                                      14
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3870 Filed 03/23/23 Page 15 of 19




          f. Plaintiff’s Objection 6
       Finally, McEachin objects to Judge Stafford’s finding that

 McEachin exhausted the policy’s 24-month benefit period for disabilities
 caused by mental or nervous disorders. She argues that when she was
 awarded benefits initially, it was purely for her physical disabilities and

 not for any mental condition. Reliance responds that there had always
 been a mental component to McEachin’s disability, and that the previous
 benefit award was based at least in part on those mental conditions.

       The parties do not dispute that, as of April, 2021 when Reliance
 terminated McEachin’s benefits, she was totally disabled from full-time
 work because of a mental impairment. As Dr. Dlugach—a Reliance file

 reviewer and board certified psychiatrist—explained, McEachin “did not
 have capacity to work . . . as of 4/2/21 . . . in any capacity due to severe
 symptoms of depression and anxiety” and other conditions. ECF No. 9,

 PageID.560.
       The policy provides that benefits for disabilities “caused by or
 contributed to by mental or nervous disorders” will not be paid beyond an

 “aggregate lifetime maximum duration” of 24 months. ECF No. 9,
 PageID.46. In Okuno v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., the Sixth Circuit
 explained that identical language excluded coverage “only when the

 claimant’s physical disability was insufficient to render him totally
 disabled.” 836 F.3d 600, 608-609. (6th Cir. 2016). While Okuno did not
 address the precise situation of this case, the logic of Okuno dictates the

                                      15
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3871 Filed 03/23/23 Page 16 of 19




 result here. If, at some point, McEachin’s physical disability was
 insufficient to render her totally disabled while she received benefits for

 total disability, the “clock” on the policy’s 24-month limit for mental or
 nervous disorder-related disability would begin to run at that time.
 Reliance bears the burden of proof on that issue. Id. at 609.

       On her initial disability claim form, McEachin reported that she
 was unable to work due to “recurrent headaches, neck and back pain”
 caused by a car crash. ECF No. 9, PageID.587. There was no mention of

 the kind of psychiatric or cognitive symptoms that would suggest any
 mental impairment. Nevertheless, there can be no dispute that
 psychiatric symptoms have existed in this case for some time; McEachin’s

 medical records reflect ongoing treatment for a mental health condition.
 For example, beginning in approximately July, 2019, McEachin received
 regular treatment from Eileen Craig, a Licensed Professional Counselor.

 ECF No. 9-2, PageID.1739-1778; ECF No. 9-3, PageID.2231-2252.
       In responding to McEachin’s objection, Reliance argues that
 “mental issues were a part of [McEachin’s] claim since the beginning.”

 D’s. Resp., ECF No. 22, PageID.3854 (emphasis added). But in Okuno,
 the Sixth Circuit specifically rejected the argument that the “mere
 presence of a psychiatric component” in a disability claim justifies

 application of a mental health limitation. Okuno, 836 F.3d at 607. Rather,
 a time limitation for mental health-related disability applies when a
 claimant’s physical conditions are insufficient to render them disabled,
                                      16

 and mental impairment is thus a but-for cause of a claimant’s overall
 total disability.

       Reliance argues that McEachin does not “cite to any evidence in
 support of her position” that her benefits were awarded solely on the
 basis of physical impairments. ECF No. 22, PageID.3853. But that is not

 McEachin’s burden. If Reliance seeks to rely upon a retroactive
 application of the mental impairment exclusion to limit benefits, it must
 bear the burden of showing that its prior award of benefits was for a

 mental disability. And in light of Okuno, it can only do so if it shows that
 mental impairment was a but-for cause of McEachin’s total disability.
 Reliance has not made such a showing, instead merely reiterating that

 mental symptoms were a “part” of McEachin’s claim.
       Not only has Reliance failed to show that mental impairment was
 a but-for cause of McEachin’s total disability claim prior to April, 2021,

 Reliance appears to have concluded just the opposite. When it initially
 terminated McEachin’s benefits in 2020, Reliance determined that
 McEachin’s medical records reflected no “evidence of moderate to severe

 psychiatric symptoms or resulting functional impairments.” ECF No. 9,
 PageID.181, 555. Reliance further stated that “there were no findings”
 that McEachin “would be precluded from working” while receiving

 psychotherapy. Id. And Nicole Joyce, a clinical social worker who
 reviewed McEachin’s behavioral health treatment records in November,


                                      17
Case 2:21-cv-12819-TGB-EAS ECF No. 23, PageID.3873 Filed 03/23/23 Page 18 of 19




 2020, opined that “lack of consistent work function due to psychiatric
 impairment [was] not supported.” Id. at PageID.183-84.

       Reliance has not shown that, at any point during the period in
 which it paid benefits, McEachin’s physical disability was insufficient to
 render her totally disabled. And, as Reliance concedes, McEachin is now

 precluded from work due to a mental impairment. See ECF No. 9,
 PageID.560. Accordingly, McEachin has not exhausted the 24-month cap
 on benefits due to a mental impairment, and that period began to run on

 April 1, 2021 when Reliance determined both that McEachin was no
 longer disabled due to a physical condition, and was disabled due to a
 mental condition. Accordingly, Reliance must pay McEachin benefits

 until the 24-month period is exhausted, so long as McEachin has been
 and continues to be totally disabled from work because of a mental
 impairment.
                             IV.   CONCLUSION
       After careful review, Magistrate Judge Stafford’s Report and
 Recommendation is ACCEPTED IN PART AND REJECTED IN

 PART. Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 10) is
 GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, Defendant’s motion for
 summary judgment (ECF No. 11) is GRANTED IN PART AND

 DENIED IN PART. Specifically, the Report and Recommendation is
 REJECTED with respect to its conclusions regarding the 24-month limit

 for   benefits   due   to   a   mental    impairment.   The    Report   and
 Recommendation is ACCEPTED AND ADOPTED in all other respects.

       Reliance is ORDERED to pay McEachin long-term disability
 benefits due under the plan starting on the day it denied McEachin’s
 physical impairment claim, which appears to be April 1, 2021. Benefits

 shall be paid up to the 24-month maximum duration so long as McEachin
 has remained and continues to remain totally disabled and satisfies all
 other policy requirements.

       Any request for an award of attorney fees must be filed, along with
 documentation in support, within 21 days of the day this Order issues.
 Defendant may respond within 14 days thereafter.

       As all of the outstanding claims in this matter have been fully
 resolved, this case is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. The Court will
 retain jurisdiction to consider any request for reasonable attorney’s fees.

 IT IS SO ORDERED.
       DATED this 23rd day of March, 2022.


                                    BY THE COURT:
