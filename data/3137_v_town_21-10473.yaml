  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in determining that their complaint failed to state a plausible claim for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and (c).

  2. Appellants contended that the district court erred in rejecting their claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and § 1985, including claims that the defendants conspired to deprive them of constitutional rights.

  3. Appellants argued that the district court erred in rejecting their First Amendment claims, including that the Harwich Noise Ordinance was impermissibly broad and vague, and that the Board''s actions constituted retaliation for their public complaints of selective enforcement.

  4. Appellants contended that the district court erred in rejecting their Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process claims, including that the Board unlawfully delayed renewal of their liquor and entertainment licenses and failed to follow required procedures.

  5. Appellants argued that the district court erred in rejecting their equal protection claim, alleging selective enforcement of the noise ordinance and COVID-19 restrictions against them while other licensees were not disciplined.

  6. Appellants contended that the district court erred in rejecting their claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), alleging that defendants conspired to deny them rights under the MCRA and the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights through threats, intimidation, or coercion.

  7. Appellants argued that the district court erred in rejecting their state law civil conspiracy claim, asserting that the Harwich defendants had a ''peculiar power of coercion'' over them as enforcers of liquor license regulations.

  8. Appellants contended that the district court erred in rejecting their defamation claims against Gail O. Sluis, Larry Ballantine, and Patricia A. O''Neill, alleging that each made false statements or reports regarding their alleged violations of COVID-19 restrictions and license conditions.

  9. Appellants argued that the district court erred in dismissing their supplemental state law claims with prejudice after dismissing the foundational federal claims.

  10. Appellants contended that the district court erred in denying their request for leave to amend their complaint as futile, arguing they should have been given at least one chance to amend before dismissal with prejudice and that limited discovery was necessary to flesh out the allegations.'
