outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Dahua Technology USA, Inc.''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Dahua argued that the district court erred in concluding that the severance provision in the Release Agreement unambiguously required Dahua to pay Zhang $680,000 per month for sixteen months, rather than a total of $680,000 paid over sixteen months.

  2. Dahua contended that the district court should have found the severance provision ambiguous and considered extrinsic evidence of the parties'' intent to determine the correct amount of severance owed.

  3. Dahua asserted that the district court erred by rejecting its contract interpretation argument on waiver grounds.

  4. Dahua argued that the district court should have applied equitable remedies, such as implying a quasi-contract or reforming the contract, to avoid what it characterized as an unintended $10 million windfall to Zhang.

  5. Dahua claimed that Zhang breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to sign an amendment to correct what Dahua described as a scrivener''s error in the Release Agreement.'
