reason_for_appeal: '=== United States of America''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. The United States argued that the district court erred in holding that the 2010 amendment to the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), which states that a claim ''resulting from'' an AKS violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act (FCA), imposes a ''but-for'' causation standard.

  2. The United States contended that the proper standard under the 2010 amendment is that a claim is false if a patient was exposed to an illegal inducement and a provider subsequently submitted a claim for reimbursement for that patient, regardless of whether the claim would have been submitted absent the kickback.

  3. The United States asserted that the district court should have adopted the Third Circuit''s approach, which requires only a sufficient causal connection between the AKS violation and the claim, not but-for causation.

  4. The United States argued that the district court''s interpretation was inconsistent with the statutory context and legislative history, which, according to the government, intended to broaden FCA liability for AKS violations beyond a strict but-for causation requirement.'
