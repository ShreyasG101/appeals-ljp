LORNA G. SCHOFIELD, District Judge:                                       
    Defendants Andre Tomes Balazs, Andre Balazs Properties, Balazs Investors, LLC, 
and Hotels A.B., LLC and Respondent Chateau Holdings, Ltd. (“Chateau”) move for 
confirmation of an arbitral award issued on January 17, 2023 (the “Award”).  Plaintiff Adrian 
Jules and his former counsel Thomas A. Farinella, as an interested party, each cross-move to 
vacate the Award.  For the following reasons, the Award is confirmed.  Defendants’ motion is 
granted, and Plaintiff and Farinella’s motions are denied.                
    BACKGROUND                                                           
    On December 11, 2020, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit, asserting sixteen causes of action 
against Defendants under federal and California law which centered, in substance, on Plaintiff’s 
employment with Chateau.  Defendants then moved to compel arbitration before JAMS pursuant 
to an arbitration agreement between Plaintiff and Chateau.  An order issued May 28, 2021, 
stayed this action pending the outcome of arbitration.                    
    A preliminary arbitration hearing was held on January 21, 2022, at which Plaintiff stated 
he did not wish to amend his claims.  On May 31, 2022, Plaintiff sought leave to amend to add 
Andre Balazs, the CEO of Andre Balazs Properties, as an additional respondent to the 
arbitration, despite having previously dismissed claims against him.  Over Defendants’ 
objections, the Arbitrator allowed Plaintiff to file a proposed amended complaint “alleg[ing] the 
predicate facts underlying any claims against Mr. Balazs.”  The Arbitrator noted that he would 
consider a motion for costs against Plaintiff if he had no good faith basis to bring claims against 
Mr. Balazs.  Plaintiff untimely filed a proposed complaint. The Arbitrator denied the request for 

leave to amend, finding that the proposed complaint did not allege claims or predicate facts 
against Mr. Balazs and instead added new factual allegations and claims against Chateau and 
other entities not joined in the arbitration.  Respondent moved to tax costs against Plaintiff.  The 
Arbitrator sua sponte converted the motion into a request for sanctions and requested further 
briefing.  Plaintiff did not submit sanctions briefing and instead stated his intention to withdraw 
from the arbitration.  On October 6, 2022, the Arbitrator determined that Plaintiff’s grounds for 
withdrawing were without merit and concluded that Respondent was entitled to an award of 
sanctions to be determined at the conclusion of the arbitration.          
    In parallel, on September 23, 2022, Plaintiff moved in this Court to lift the stay pending 
arbitration.  On October 11, 2022, Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction and related relief, 

seeking, in substance, to lift the stay.  Plaintiff’s motions were denied.  Plaintiff moved for 
reconsideration, which was also denied.                                   
    In advance of the arbitral hearing scheduled for December 5, 2022, Plaintiff filed 
disclosures of documents to be used and witnesses to be called at the arbitration hearing one 
week after the deadline to do so.  At a final status conference on November 21, 2022, Plaintiff 
did not raise any issues related to his medical condition or request a continuance of the hearing.  
In the lead-up to the December 5 hearing, Plaintiff missed several filing deadlines and the 
deadline to complete his own deposition.   One week before the hearing, Farinella reported that, 
for medical reasons, Plaintiff was unable to be deposed or participate in the hearing.  Although 
the Arbitrator viewed Plaintiff’s evidence of medical necessity as insufficient to postpone the 
hearing, the Arbitrator allowed Plaintiff to submit further written evidence of medical necessity.   
Plaintiff did so, and the Arbitrator found this evidence also insufficient.  The Arbitrator set a 
special hearing for Plaintiff to provide further evidence of his medical condition not captured in 

his written submissions.  Plaintiff did not appear at the special hearing, and the Arbitrator 
decided to proceed with the arbitral hearing.  Plaintiff appeared briefly at the arbitral hearing via 
Zoom, with his microphone muted.  After Plaintiff left the Zoom conference, Farinella refused to 
proceed or put on a case.                                                 
    On January 17, 2023, the Arbitrator issued the Award, finding that Plaintiff had failed to 
prove any of his claims by a preponderance of the evidence.  The Award also awarded sanctions 
to Defendants of $11,416.50 and $23,026.50 against Plaintiff and Farinella respectively.  An 
order issued February 24, 2023, granted Farinella’s request to withdraw from representing 
Plaintiff in proceedings in this District.  Defendants now move to confirm the Award.  Plaintiff 
and Farinella, as an interested party, move to vacate the Award.          

    LEGAL STANDARD                                                       
    Ordinarily, confirmation of an arbitration decision is “a summary proceeding that merely 
makes what is already a final arbitration award a judgment of the court.”  Commodities & Mins. 
Enter. Ltd. v. CVG Ferrominera Orinoco, C.A., 49 F.4th 802, 809 (2d Cir. 2022).1  A district 
court’s role in reviewing an arbitration award is “narrowly limited and arbitration panel 
determinations are generally accorded great deference under the Federal Arbitration Act.”  Kolel 
Beth Yechiel Mechil of Tartikov, Inc. v. YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d 99, 103 (2d Cir. 2013);

accord Kellner v. Amazon, No. 22-734, 2023 WL 2230288, at *1 (2d Cir. Feb. 27, 2023) 
(summary order).  Courts exercise this “extremely deferential” review “in order to avoid 
undermining the twin goals of arbitration, namely, settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long 
and expensive litigation.”  Commodities & Mins. Enter. Ltd., 49 F.4th at 809.  Ultimately, “an 

arbitral decision even arguably construing or applying the contract must stand, regardless of a 
court’s view of its demerits.”  Weiss v. Sallie Mae, Inc., 939 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2019). 
    A pro se litigant’s papers must be construed liberally “to raise the strongest arguments 
they suggest.”  Publicola v. Lomenzo, 54 F.4th 108, 111 (2d Cir. 2022).  Pro se litigants are 
accorded “special solicitude to protect them from inadvertent forfeiture of important rights 
because of their lack of legal training.”  Kotler v. Jubert, 986 F.3d 147, 156 (2d Cir. 2021).  
Nonetheless, “pro se status does not exempt a party from compliance with relevant rules of 
procedural and substantive law.”  Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 477 (2d 
Cir. 2006); accord Gerding v. Am. Kennel Club, No. 21 Civ. 7958, 2023 WL 4583771, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2023).                                                 

    DISCUSSION                                                           
    A.   Subject Matter Jurisdiction                                     
    Plaintiff challenges the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction.  Subject matter jurisdiction 
exists over the parties’ motions.  Federal question jurisdiction exists because Plaintiff filed this 
action asserting claims under federal law -- the U.S. Constitution, Title VII and the Americans 
with Disabilities Act.  Because of the federal questions presented, the Court had subject matter 
jurisdiction when it stayed the action pending arbitration.  District courts with jurisdiction to stay 
an action pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 3 retain jurisdiction to confirm resulting arbitral awards.  See 
Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill Harbert Constr. Co., 529 U.S. 193, 202 (2000) (“[T]he court with 
the power to stay the action under § 3 has the further power to confirm any ensuing arbitration 
award.”).  Badgerow v. Walters, 142 S. Ct. 1310 (2022), which Plaintiff cites, does not change 
this result, because that case concerned jurisdiction over an action originally filed to confirm an 
arbitral award, rather than one filed to assert federal causes of action and stayed pending 

arbitration.                                                              
    B.   Motions to Vacate                                               
    “The [Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”)] provides a streamlined process for a party 
seeking a judicial decree confirming an award, an order vacating it, or an order modifying or 
correcting it.”  Seneca Nation of Indians v. N.Y., 988 F.3d 618, 625 (2d Cir. 2021).  Section 10(a) 
of the FAA states four narrow grounds for vacating an arbitration award:  
    (1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; 
    (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of 
    them;                                                                
    (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the 
    hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent 
    and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights 
    of any party have been prejudiced; or                                
    (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them 
    that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not 
    made.                                                                

9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(1)-(4).  In addition to the statutory grounds for vacatur, a district court may 
vacate arbitration awards where the arbitrators acted in manifest disregard of the law or when 
enforcement of an award would violate an explicit public policy.  See Smarter Tools Inc. v. 
Chongqing SENCI Imp. & Exp. Trade Co., Ltd., 57 F.4th 372, 383 (2d Cir. 2023); Schwartz v. 
Merrill Lynch & Co., 665 F.3d 444, 452 (2d Cir. 2011); accord Absolute Nev., LLC v. Grand 
Majestic Riverboat Co., LLC, No. 19 Civ. 11479, 2022 WL 17669429, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 
2022).  Plaintiff and Farinella offer arguments for vacatur under each of the § 10(a) grounds and 
the two non-statutory grounds.  Their arguments fail because the evidence is insufficient to 
“clear [the] high hurdle” for vacating the Award.  Beijing Shougang Mining Inv. Co., Ltd.  v. 
Mongolia, 11 F.4th 144, 160 (2d Cir. 2021).                               
         1.   Corruption, Fraud or Undue Means                           
    A petitioner seeking to vacate an arbitral award under § 10(a)(1) “must adequately plead 

that (1) respondent engaged in fraudulent activity; (2) even with the exercise of due diligence, 
petitioner could not have discovered the fraud prior to the award issuing; and (3) the fraud 
materially related to an issue in the arbitration.”  Odeon Cap. Grp. LLC v. Ackerman, 864 F.3d 
191, 196 (2d Cir. 2017); accord O’ Connor-Roche v. RBC Cap. Mkts., LLC, No. 22 Civ. 1467, 
2022 WL 17798116, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2022).  Plaintiff alleges that the Final Award was 
procured by undue means because the Arbitrator denied Plaintiff’s request to postpone the 
arbitral hearing in light of Plaintiff’s medical condition.  To succeed on a claim under § 10(a)(1), 
Plaintiff must plead that “respondent engaged in fraudulent activity.”  Ackerman, 864 F.3d at 
196 (emphasis added).  Here, Plaintiff alleges no fraud committed by Chateau or Defendants.  
Section § 10(a)(1) does not apply.                                        

         2.   Arbitrator Partiality or Corruption                        
    A district court can vacate an award under § 10(a)(2) “when there was evident partiality 
in the arbitrator,” as proven by clear and convincing evidence.  Certain Underwriting Members 
of Lloyds of London v. Fla. Dep’t of Fin. Servs., 892 F.3d 501, 505 (2d Cir. 2018); accord 
Whittaker v. MHR Fund Mgmt. LLC, No. 20 Civ. 7599, 2021 WL 9811715, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 
Sept. 28, 2021).  “Among the circumstances under which the evident-partiality standard is likely 
to be met are those in which an arbitrator fails to disclose a relationship or interest that is 
strongly suggestive of bias in favor of one of the parties.”  Scandinavian Reinsurance Co. v. 
Saint Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 668 F.3d 60, 72 (2d Cir. 2012); accord Est. of Scherban v. 
Lynch, No. 14 Civ. 6312, 2021 WL 2581278, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 23, 2021).  Plaintiff alleges 
evident partiality of the Arbitrator based on two instances.  Neither is availing.   
    First, Plaintiff alleges the Arbitrator was evidently partial by sua sponte converting 
Chateau’s request to tax costs into a request for sanctions.  Plaintiff’s argument fails because the 

Arbitrator’s action was in response to Plaintiff’s explicit disregard of the Arbitrator’s instructions 
that Plaintiff could seek to replead in order to allege claims or predicate facts against Mr. Balazs.  
In his proposed amended complaint, Plaintiff completely disregarded the Arbitrator’s 
instructions and simply bolstered his allegations against the existing Defendants.  The Arbitrator 
had warned Plaintiff in advance that such disregard could result in a taxing of costs.  Because the 
rules governing the arbitration did not allow for taxing of costs, the Arbitrator converted 
Defendants’ request for costs into one for sanctions.  These circumstances fall far short of 
providing clear and convincing evidence of partiality such that “a reasonable person would have 
to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.”  Fla. Dep’t of Fin. 
Servs., 892 F.3d at 505; see also Chen v. Chen Qualified Settlement Fund, 552 F.3d 218, 227 (2d 

Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (“[A]dverse rulings, without more, will rarely suffice to provide a 
reasonable basis for questioning . . . impartiality.”); Sakon v. Andreo, 119 F.3d 109, 113 (2d Cir. 
1997) (discussing district court’s inherent power to award sanctions so long as the award is 
explained with specificity).                                              
    Second, Plaintiff alleges that the Arbitrator was evidently partial by issuing an order 
allowing Plaintiff to proffer all his evidence at the final hearing, rather than rule on admissibility 
in advance, “to avoid the risk of erroneous exclusion.”  Plaintiff argues that the failure to offer 
him a similar opportunity with respect to the proposed amended complaint constitutes bias or 
misconduct.  If anything, this order demonstrates solicitousness to Plaintiff’s claims and 
procedural rights.  In any event, it is not clear and convincing evidence of the Arbitrator’s 
evident partiality.                                                       
         3.   Arbitrator Misconduct                                      
    A district court can vacate an award under § 10(a)(3) “when the arbitrators were guilty of 

misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to 
hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy.”  YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d at 104.  
“Under prevailing Second Circuit law, if there exists a reasonable basis for the arbitrator’s 
considered decision not to grant a postponement, a court should be reluctant to interfere with the 
award.”  Parrella v. Orange Rabbit, Inc., No 20 Civ. 9923, 2021 WL 4462809, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Sept. 29, 2021); accord United Media Holdings, NV v. Forbes Media, LLC, No. 16 Civ. 5926, 
2017 WL 9473164, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2017) (“The granting or denying of an adjournment 
falls within the broad discretion of appointed arbitrators.”).  The relevant inquiry under 
§ 10(a)(3) is whether the arbitrator’s decisions in conducting the proceeding “amount to a denial 
of fundamental fairness.”  Tempo Shain Corp. v. Bertek, Inc., 120 F.3d 16, 20 (2d Cir. 1997); 

accord YLL Irrevocable Tr., 729 F.3d at 104.                              
    Plaintiff and Farinella both argue that the Arbitrator was guilty of misconduct because he 
failed to consider evidence of Plaintiff’s medical condition and failed to postpone the arbitral 
hearing based on this evidence.  These arguments fail because Plaintiff and Farinella have not 
shown that the Arbitrator’s decision to proceed with the hearing rather than adjourn it was 
without a reasonable basis or a denial of fundamental fairness.           
    To the contrary, the record indicates that the Arbitrator gave Plaintiff and Farinella 
repeated chances to offer evidence of Plaintiff’s medical condition and carefully considered it.  
At the November 21, 2022, final pre-arbitration conference, Plaintiff did not request a 
continuance or argue that he was unable to prepare for the arbitration due to any medical 
condition.  One week before the December 5, 2022, hearing date, Farinella reported that Plaintiff 
had recently been hospitalized due to an accident and that Farinella did not believe Plaintiff was 
medically fit to attend the hearing, even via Zoom.  The Arbitrator then requested that Plaintiff 

submit medical documentation to substantiate that his medical condition was serious enough to 
warrant postponement, which Plaintiff did.  The Arbitrator determined Plaintiff’s evidence was 
insufficient to warrant postponement because the records were not signed by a physician, were 
dated months prior to the hearing date or otherwise failed to provide enough detail regarding 
Plaintiff’s condition to conclude he could not participate, even via Zoom.  Nevertheless, the 
Arbitrator scheduled a special hearing to allow Plaintiff to testify (via Zoom) as to any facts 
about his medical issues that were not captured in the documentation.  Plaintiff did not attend.  
The Arbitrator then determined that the arbitration should go forward as scheduled at 1:00 P.M. 
on December 5, 2022.                                                      
    The Arbitrator had a reasonable basis for not postponing the arbitration.  Bisnoff v. King, 

154 F. Supp. 2d 630 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), upon which Plaintiff relies is not binding and in any event, 
does not support vacatur.  In Bisnoff, the court found circumstantial evidence -- including 
petitioner’s failure to raise potential medical issues at a preliminary hearing, petitioner’s failure 
to raise his medical issues until shortly before the hearing and the lack of sufficient medical 
documentation substantiating petitioner’s alleged ailment2 -- provided a reasonable basis for the 


2 Plaintiff’s additional medical documentation, which was not submitted to the Arbitrator at the 
time he declined to postpone the hearing, is not considered.  The inquiry is whether the 
Arbitrator had a reasonable basis at the time of his decision.  Any new medical documentation 
that Plaintiff had not presented is not relevant to the inquiry.  See Tempo Shain Corp., 120 F.3d 
at 20 (“[A]rbitration determinations will not be opened up to evidentiary review.”); accord CRT 
Cap. Grp. LLC v. SLS Cap., S.A., No. 18 Civ. 3986, 2019 WL 1437159, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 
31, 2019).                                                                
panel to deny adjournment.  Id. at 639.  Here, as in Bisnoff, Plaintiff similarly failed to raise any 
potential medical accommodations at the final status conference, requested an adjournment just 
one week prior to the arbitral hearing and did not provide medical documentation that indicated a 
serious enough condition to warrant postponement.                         

    Nor was the Arbitrator’s decision fundamentally unfair.  Tempo Shain Corp., also cited 
by Plaintiff, is distinguishable because there, a witness became temporarily unavailable during 
the arbitration when his wife was diagnosed with cancer, and the panel concluded the hearing 
without his testimony.  120 F.3d at 17-18.  The Second Circuit found that this amounted to 
fundamental unfairness sufficient to vacate the arbitral award under § 10(a)(3).  Id. at 21.  That 
reasoning does not apply here because Plaintiff and Farinella refused to present any evidence or 
argument or otherwise participate in the hearing.  “To demonstrate arbitral misconduct, the 
challenging party must show that his right to be heard has been grossly and totally blocked, and 
that this exclusion of evidence prejudiced him.”  Fid. Brokerage Servs. LLC v. Deutsch, No. 17 
Civ. 5778, 2018 WL 2947972, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2018), aff’d, 763 F. App’x 104 (2d Cir. 

2019) (summary order).  Plaintiff fails to meet this standard.  Section 10(a)(3) does not apply. 
         4.   Exercise of Arbitrator Power                               
    Section 10(a)(4) provides for vacatur of an arbitration award when “the arbitrators 
exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award 
upon the subject matter submitted was not made.”  9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4).  A district court’s review 
under § 10(a)(4) “focuses on whether the arbitrators had the power, based on the parties’ 
submissions or the arbitration agreement, to reach a certain issue, not whether the arbitrators 
correctly decided that issue.”  Beijing Shougang Mining Inv. Co., Ltd., 11 F.4th at 161 (stating 
the Second Circuit “consistently accord[s] the narrowest of readings” to this provision).  An 
award should be vacated under § 10(a)(4) “only when an arbitrator strays from interpretation and 
application of the agreement and effectively dispenses his own brand of industrial justice.”  Stolt-
Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp., 559 U.S. 662, 663 (2010); accord KT Corp. v. ABS 
Holdings, Ltd., 784 F. App’x 21, 24 (2d Cir. 2019) (summary order).       

    Plaintiff and Farinella argue for vacatur under § 10(a)(4) because the Arbitrator did not 
have the power to award sanctions under the arbitration agreement.  This argument is incorrect. 
    The arbitration agreement states that “claims, disputes or controversies” between Plaintiff 
and Chateau “shall be addressed . . . by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act 
administered by JAMS pursuant to its Employment Arbitration Rules then in effect, and subject 
to JAMS Policy on Employment Arbitration Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness.”  
JAMS Rule 29 -- incorporated by the arbitration agreement -- states:      
    The Arbitrator may order appropriate sanctions for failure of a Party to comply 
    with its obligations under any of these Rules or with an order of the Arbitrator. 
    These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, assessment of Arbitration fees 
    and Arbitrator compensation and expenses[] [and] any other costs occasioned by 
    the actionable conduct, including reasonable attorneys’ fees . . . .3 

The Arbitrator awarded sanctions against Plaintiff and Farinella for failing to comply with the 
Arbitrator’s order as explicitly contemplated by JAMS Rule 29.  Plaintiff cites California law 
and the California Arbitration Act (“CAA”) for the proposition that the award of fees and costs 
to prevailing parties in employment arbitrations is disfavored.  As noted above, the FAA and the 
arbitration agreement, and not California Law or the CAA, determine the Arbitrator’s power to 
in carrying out the arbitration proceeding.                               

3 JAMS, Employment Arbitration Rules and Procedures Rule 29: Sanctions,   
https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-employment-arbitration/english#Rule-29 (last visited Sept. 11, 
2023) (JAMS Rules effective as of June 1, 2021).                          
      Farinella separately argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his power because he 
“considered Plaintiff’s failure to attend the arbitration hearing a waiver despite him being 
hospitalized and experiencing a medical emergency.”  This, Farinella argues, was “in 
material breach of the arbitration agreement.”  Farinella cites no evidence or provision of 

the arbitration agreement that demonstrates that the Arbitrator did not have the power to 
rule against Plaintiff after he failed to present any evidence or argument in support of his 
case.  Farinella may dispute the Arbitrator’s ultimate decision, but the inquiry under 
§ 10(a)(4) is only whether the Arbitrator had the power to come to such a decision.  See 
Beijing Shougang Mining Inv. Co., Ltd., 11 F.4th at 161.  The Arbitrator did.  Section 
10(a)(4) does not provide any basis to vacate the award.                  
         5.   Manifest Disregard of the Law                              
    A district court may set aside an arbitration award if it was rendered in manifest 
disregard of the law.  “A litigant seeking to vacate an arbitration award based on alleged 
manifest disregard of the law bears a heavy burden, as awards are vacated on grounds of 

manifest disregard only in those exceedingly rare instances where some egregious 
impropriety on the part of the arbitrator is apparent.”  See Weiss, 939 F.3d at 109.  
Vacatur under this standard is warranted only “when an arbitrator strays from 
interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispenses his own brand 
of industrial justice.”  Id.                                              
    Plaintiff argues that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in allowing the 
arbitral hearing to proceed without the presentation of evidence or argument by Plaintiff, 
in violation of his due process rights.  Plaintiff fails to prove a violation of his due 
process rights, because as discussed, the Arbitrator afforded Plaintiff and Farinella ample 
opportunity to present Plaintiff’s case.  In any event, to establish manifest disregard, 
Plaintiff must show that the arbitration “intentionally defied the law.”  
STMicroelectronics, N.V. v. Credit Suisse Sec. (USA) LLC, 648 F.3d 68, 78 (2d Cir. 
2011); accord LTF Constr. Co., LLC v. Cento Sols. Inc., No. 20 Civ. 4097, 2020 WL 

7211236, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2020).  Plaintiff does not meet this “very high” 
standard. STMicroelectronics, N.V., 648 F.3d at 74.                       
         6.   Violation of Public Policy                                 
    Finally, an arbitral award can be vacated when “the award itself, as contrasted 
with the reasoning that underlies the award, creates an explicit conflict with other laws 
and legal precedents and thus clearly violates an identifiable public policy.”  Int’l 
Brotherhood. of Elec. Workers, Loc. 97 v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., 143 F.3d 704, 
716 (2d Cir. 1998); accord Riverbay Corp. v. Serv. Emps. Int’l Union, Loc. 32BJ, No. 22 
Civ. 10994, 2023 WL 3738984, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 31, 2023).  For vacatur of 
arbitration award on public policy grounds, the public policy must be “well defined and 

dominant and must be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not 
from general considerations of supposed public interests.”  Schwartz, 665 F.3d at 452.  
Courts may refuse to enforce arbitral awards “only in those rare cases when enforcement 
of the award would be directly at odds” with public policy.  Yukos Cap. S.A.R.L. v. 
Samaraneftegaz, 592 F. App’x 8, 11 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order).        
    Plaintiff argues that enforcement of the Award would violate public policy, in 
substance because enforcement would amount to a waiver of his statutory rights in 
violation of the policy underlying various California statutes.  This argument fails first 
because the FAA embodies “a federal policy favoring arbitration agreements, 
notwithstanding any state policies to the contrary.”  Tantaros v. Fox News Network, LLC, 
12 F.4th 135, 146 (2d Cir. 2021).  The argument also fails on the merits because Plaintiff 
was given the opportunity to present his case in arbitration.  Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s 
characterization, the Arbitrator did not refuse to hear evidence material to Plaintiff’s 

claims and decided all of the questions presented in the arbitration on the record before 
him.  Plaintiff fails to show that enforcement of the Award would violate any public 
policy.                                                                   
    Farinella also argues that enforcement of the Award would violate public policy 
because of the Arbitrator’s award of sanctions.  This argument is rejected because 
Farinella does not offer any “well defined and dominant” public policy concern or 
otherwise explain his assertion.  Schwartz, 665 F.3d at 452.              
    C.   Confirmation of the Award                                       
    Under the FAA, courts must grant a petition to confirm an arbitration award “unless the 
award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11.”  9 U.S.C. § 9.  No 

grounds exist to vacate or modify the Award under those sections.  Defendants are entitled to 
confirmation of the arbitration award under the Court’s limited review in arbitration cases.  See 
Commodities & Mins. Enter. Ltd., 49 F.4th at 809.  The Award is confirmed. 
IV.    CONCLUSION 
     For the foregoing reasons, the Award is confirmed.  Defendants’ Petition for 
confirmation of the Award is GRANTED.  Plaintiff's and Farinella’s Petitions to vacate the 
Award are DENIED. 
     The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendants on 
Plaintiff's claims, close the motions at Dkt. Nos. 94 and 107 and terminate the case.

LORNA G. SCHOFIELD, District Judge:                                          
    WHEREAS, an Opinion and Order issued May 28, 2021, interpreted an Arbitration Agreement 
between the parties and stayed proceedings in this case pending completion of arbitration proceedings 
before JAMS in California, pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  On February 3, 2023, the parties 
filed a joint status letter stating that the Arbitrator issued an award on January 17, 2023 in favor of 
Defendants (the “Final Award”).  The Final Award also included sanctions against Plaintiff and 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Thomas A. Farinella.                                    
    WHEREAS, an order issued February 24, 2023, granted a request from Mr. Farinella to 
withdraw from representation of Plaintiff.  An order issued March 6, 2023, directed the parties and Mr. 
Farinella to meet and confer regarding potential settlement. That order also set a briefing schedule for 
Defendants’ anticipated motion to confirm the Final Award.                   
    WHEREAS, on March 10, 2023, Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, filed a letter on ECF alleging 
misconduct on the part of Defendants’ California counsel.  Plaintiff argued that Defendants’ California 
attorneys, who represented Defendants in the arbitration, engaged in unauthorized practice of law by 
appearing at the court-ordered meet and confer on behalf of Defendants prior to applying for admission 
pro hac vice in this matter.  An order issued March 13, 2023, stated that Plaintiff’s submissions did not 
provide a basis to conclude that Defendants acted inappropriately or engaged in unauthorized practice of 
law. 
     WHEREAS, on March 21, 2023, Paula M. Weber, one of the California attorneys who 
represented Defendants in connection with arbitration proceedings, filed a motion to appear pro hac 
vice.  On March 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed an opposition to this motion.  An order issued March 23, 2023, 
granted Ms. Weber’s motion to appear pro hac vice and stated there was no basis to impose sanctions 
against Defendants or Ms. Weber.  The same day, Plaintiff filed a motion seeking disqualification and 
other sanctions against David Greenhaus.  In that motion, Plaintiff renews his arguments that Defendants 
engaged in unauthorized practice of law.  It is hereby 
     ORDERED that Plaintiff's request for sanctions against Mr. Greenhaus is DENIED.  Plaintiff's 
submissions are construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments they suggest, given 
Plaintiff's pro se status.  See Saeli v. Chautauqua Cnty., 36 F.4th 445, 457 (2d Cir. 2022).  The Court 
has held that defense counsel did not engage in unauthorized practice of law.  Accordingly, there is no 
basis to impose sanctions against Mr. Greenhaus on the basis of aiding his co-counsel in unauthorized 
practice of law. 
     The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the motion at Dkt. 92.

    WHEREAS, on February 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a letter motion seeking to file the Final Award 
entirely under seal and requesting that no briefing schedule regarding Defendants’ anticipated motion to 
confirm the Final Award be entered pending resolution of parallel proceedings in California.  On 
February 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amended version of this letter motion.  On February 16, 2023, 
Defendants filed a letter opposing both of Plaintiff’s requests.             
    WHEREAS, the Final Award has been publicly filed in the California state court litigation.  
    WHEREAS, under 9 U.S.C. § 12, “[n]otice of a motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award 
must be served . . . within three months after the award is filed or delivered.”  “[A] party may not raise a 
motion to vacate, modify, or correct an arbitration award after the three month period has run, even

                        Investors, LLC, Hotels A.B., LLC 
                        Case No. 1:20-cv-10500-LGS 

Dear Judge Schofield: 
      This Firm represents the Plaintiff in connection with this matter.  The Court Ordered that 
the “Plaintiff shall file a copy of the Final Award as soon as possible, and no later than February 
8, 2023.  If Plaintiff would like to file portions of the Final Award under seal, he may file a letter 
motion to seal pursuant to Individual Rule I.D.3.”  The Plaintiff requested an extension to file the 
motion.  The Court granted the Plaintiff's extension until February 10, 2022.  Additionally, the 
Court Ordered, “such a letter will explain why Defendants’ contemplated motion to enforce the 
arbitral award should not be briefed at this time. If Plaintiff files such a letter, Defendants will have 
the  opportunity  to  respond.  If Plaintiff does  not  file  such  a  letter,  a  briefing  schedule  for 
Defendants’ contemplated motion will be entered.”  The Plaintiff respectfully submits this letter 
in response to the Court’s Order. 
      Request to Seal 
      There is a presumption of public access to anything that qualifies as a “judicial document,” 
     a “filed item that is ‘relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the 
judicial process.‘ Bernstein v Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann L.L.P., 814 F3d 132, 139 
[2d Cir 2016], quoting Lugosch v Pyramid Co., 435 F3d 110, 119 [2d Cir 2006]. The presumption 
is “at its strongest” when “the information at issue forms the basis of the court’s adjudication.” 
Liberty Re (Bermuda) Liberty Re Ltd. v Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., No. 04 Civ. 5044 
(NRB), 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9774, 2005 WL 1216292, at *6 [S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2005]. This 

presumption remains “strong” even where “the Court did not rely on” the documents, so long as 
they were “brought to the Court’s attention in connection with a contested matter.” Accent Delight 
Intl. Ltd. v Sotheby's, 394 F Supp 3d 399, 417 [S.D.N.Y. 2019], citing Lugosch v Pyramid Co., 
435 F3d 110, 121 [2d Cir 2006].  “[A]fter determining the weight of the presumption of access, 
the court must balance competing considerations against it” by [*9] considering “countervailing 
factors includ[ing] but . . . not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial 
efficiency  and  the  privacy  interests  of  those  resisting  disclosure.”  Mut.  Mar.  Off.,  Inc.  v 
Transfercom Ltd., No. 08 Civ. 10367 (PGG), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31739, 2009 WL 1025965, 
at *4 [S.D.N.Y. Apr. 15, 2009] [internal quotation marks omitted]. “The party seeking to maintain 
the seal carries the burden of demonstrating the need to seal.” Park Ave. Life Ins. Co. v Allianz Life 
Ins. Co. of N. Am., No. 19-CV-1089 (JMF), 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164382, 2019 WL 4688705,

    While “[c]ourts in the Second Circuit” will allow for sealing and redaction to “protect[ ] 
from disclosure proprietary, sensitive, and confidential business information,” the party seeking 
sealing must provide the court with enough clarity to determine why the information in question 
should be protected from disclosure. See Adams v Adams, 21 Misc 396 [N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1897] 
[LGS], Markowitz v Kbi Servs., No. 21-mc-00397-LGS, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195281, 2021 WL 
4555833, at *2 [S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 2021].                                   
    The Final Award contains an enormous amount of information about the Plaintiff’s mental 
and physical health because it was an underlying issue throughout the arbitration.  The Final Award 
has intertwined these issues throughout the entire decision, so much so that merely redacting would 
not be an appropriate remedy.  Additionally, the Final Award should be kept confidential but it 
awards sanctions to the Defendant of which can be used to exploit the result in the media or public.  
Nevertheless, at this point the Final Award must be part of the motion to confirm the award.  
Plaintiff  requests  that  the  Final  Award  be  filed  with  the  motion.   Additionally,  a  recent 
development is that the Plaintiff has reached out the Defendant to discuss resolution of the matter 
which would include confidentiality agreement and general releases and a public disclosure of the 
award could hamper the ability to resolve the matter.                     
    Motion to Confirm                                                    
    Plaintiff’s Petition in Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. 22STCP04507, seeks relief 
that will potentially render the arbitration award obsolete. Therefore, the Plaintiff respectfully 
submits that waiting for the California litigation to conclude  is appropriate where there is a strong 
probability the issues necessary to a determination of the action would be concluded, in whole or 
in part, in the other proceeding and this condition applies here. Federal ins. Fed. Ins. Co. v Superior 
Ct., 60 Cal App 4th 1370, 1373 [1998]; Belnap Frgt. Lines, Inc. v Petty, 46 Cal App 3d 159, 164 
[1975].                                                                   
    Additionally, JAMS established, “the applicable substantive law controlling the arbitration 
as Federal Law and the law of the State of California” since the arbitration is a California 
Proceeding.  Therefore, a confirmation of the final award should be issued pursuant to the Federal 
Arbitration Act and California Arbitration Act (CAA). However, Defendant seeks to confirm the 
award pursuant to FAA despite Plaintiff having the right to petition for vacatur pursuant to the 
CAA.                                                                      
herein to allow Plaintiff to petition for a vacatur of the final award and deny confirmation pursuant 
to FAA Section 9, or in the alternative stay the proceeding.              

    Thank you for considering Plaintiff’s request.                       
                        Respectfully submitted,

LORNA G. SCHOFIELD, District Judge:                                          
WHEREAS, an Opinion and Order issued May 28, 2021, interpreted an Arbitration Agreement 
between the parties and stayed proceedings in this case pending completion of arbitration proceedings 
before JAMS in California.  On September 22, 2022, Plaintiff filed a letter seeking a lift of the stay and 
sanctions against Defendants, based on their alleged breach of the Agreement.  On September 30, 2022, 
the JAMS Arbitrator issued a decision rejecting Plaintiff’s claim of breach and his attempt to withdraw 
from arbitration.  On October 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed a letter requesting a preliminary injunction and 
judgment in his favor.                                                       
WHEREAS, an Order issued October 12, 2022 (the “October 12 Order”) denied Plaintiff’s 
requests.  It held that the Arbitrator has jurisdiction over Defendant’s alleged breach of the parties’ 
Agreement, and that the Arbitrator’s September 30, 2022, decision finding no such breach or any other 
basis for Plaintiff to withdraw required the denial of Plaintiff’s motions.  
WHEREAS, on October 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the October 12 
Order.  The motion makes various arguments, including that a recently-issued decision affirms Plaintiff’s 
legal arguments and that the October 12 Order incorrectly concluded the parties’ Agreement delegated the 
question of breach to the Arbitrator.  It further argues that the Order incorrectly refers to Defendant’s 
breach as “alleged,” that the Order erred in agreeing with the Arbitrator that Plaintiff was not entitled to 
withdraw from arbitration, and that Plaintiff was unable to sufficiently present his claims. 
WHEREAS, “[a] party may move for reconsideration and obtain relief only when the party 
identifies an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct 
a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.” Cho v. Blackberry Ltd., 991 F.3d 155, 170 (2d Cir. 2021) 
(cleaned up). “The standard for granting such a motion is strict, and reconsideration will generally be 
denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked -- 
matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.” 
Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).                                      
WHEREAS, Plaintiff argues Espinoza v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, No. B314914, 
2022 WL 4480057 (Cal. Ct. App. September 27, 2022), “significantly contradicts the order.”  As a 
threshold matter, a decision of the California Court of Appeals is not “controlling law.”  Cho, 991 F.3d at 
170.  In any event, Espinoza is distinguishable.  In that case, “[t]he parties d[id] not dispute that defendant 

did not pay the arbitration provider’s invoice within 30 days of the due date for payment.”  2022 WL 
4480057, at *5.  Relying on that fact, the court concluded that the relevant California statute, Cal. Civ. 
Proc. Code § 1281.97, concerning the payment of arbitration initiation fees, was “to be strictly applied” 
and found the defendant to be in breach of the agreement.  Id.  In contrast, in this case, the parties 
vigorously dispute whether Defendants timely paid the arbitration fees, and the Arbitrator has rejected 
Plaintiff’s arguments regarding the fees’ due date.  Further, because there is no dispute that Defendants 
paid the initiation fees for arbitration, § 1281.97 does not apply to this case.  Espinoza provides no basis 
to reconsider the October 12 Order.                                          
WHEREAS, Plaintiff argues that the October 12 Order incorrectly concluded that the Arbitrator 
had jurisdiction over Defendant’s alleged breach.  He repeats prior arguments, including that the language 

of the Agreement does not “clearly and unmistakably delegate[] arbitrability” to the arbitrator.  These 
arguments were not “overlooked” -- they were considered and rejected.  Plaintiff makes other arguments 
that he could have raised before and did not, such as his claim that the enactment of § 1281.98 subsequent 
                              2                                         
to the formation of the parties’ Agreement renders an alleged violation of it outside the scope of 
arbitration.  That Plaintiff chose not to make certain arguments is not sufficient basis to reconsider the 
October 12 Order. 
 WHEREAS, Plaintiffs arguments fail on the merits regardless.  As to his argument that the 
Agreement did not unambiguously cover this dispute, by its clear and unmistakable text, the Agreement 
delegates the question of Defendant’s alleged breach to the Arbitrator. Plaintiff also argues that JAMS’ 
internal rules give employees who signed mandatory arbitration agreements as a condition of 
employment, such as himself, the right to pursue remedies in court when employers do not timely remit 
fees.  This argument fails because Defendants have paid all fees in a timely manner, as the Arbitrator 
found.  Finally, Plaintiff argues that § 1281.98 was enacted after the formation of the Agreement, meaning 
that Defendants’ alleged violation of the statute cannot be covered by the “catch-all” language in the 
Agreement.  This argument fails because (1) Plaintiff offers no authority to support his argument, (2) the 
parties’ broad agreement reflects the parties’ mutual intention to resolve disputes through arbitration, 
notwithstanding subsequent developments and (3) § 1281.98 does not apply when Defendant has paid all 
fees in a timely manner, as discussed above. 
 WHEREAS, Plaintiff has presented his arguments at length, multiple times and in multiple 
forums.  The October 12 Order rejected these arguments.  Plaintiff provides no basis to revisit it.  It is 
hereby 
 ORDERED that Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration is DENIED. 
 The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the motion at Docket 55.

LORNA G. SCHOFIELD, District Judge:                                       
    WHEREAS, Defendants moved to (1) compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration 
agreement between Plaintiff and his employer (the “Agreement”) or, alternatively for (2) a stay 
of this proceeding pending any arbitration in the Agreement’s specified venue -- Los Angeles 
County.                                                                   
    WHEREAS, the Opinion & Order, dated May 28, 2021 (“Opinion”) (Dkt No. 30), 
declined to compel arbitration, stating that (1) the Federal Arbitration Act provides that any 
arbitration proceedings resulting from a motion to compel arbitration “shall be within the district 
in which the petition for an order directing such arbitration is filed,” (2) the Agreement specifies 
that arbitration “will take place in Los Angeles County” and (3) courts in this district have 
persuasively reasoned that they should decline to compel arbitration in a venue not authorized by 
statute and stay proceedings pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 3 while awaiting the outcome of any 
arbitration in the venue specified by agreement.  The Opinion accordingly stayed this proceeding 
pending the resolution of any arbitration in California and directed status letters every sixty days 
regarding such arbitration.                                               
    WHEREAS, the parties have filed a joint status letter, in which they dispute whether 
Plaintiff or Defendants need to take certain steps to initiate arbitration (Dkt. No. 31).  Defendants 
suggest that Plaintiff should be directed to initiate arbitration in California.  Such an order would 
compel arbitration by Plaintiff, and whether the parties have taken appropriate steps to initiate 
arbitration is not a question properly resolved by this tribunal. 
     WHEREAS, “under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), in combination with the 
inherent power of a court to dismiss for failure to prosecute, a district judge may, sua sponte, and 
without notice to the parties, dismiss a complaint for want of prosecution, and such dismissal is 
largely a matter of the judge's discretion.”  Whitley v. New York State Dep’t of Corrections and 
Community Supervision, No. 17 Civ. 3652, 2021 WL 3271736, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 30, 2021) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  Factors taken into account in making this determination 
include any delay by the plaintiff and the court’s interest in managing its own docket.  See id. 
Accordingly, it is hereby 
     ORDERED that Defendants’ request for an order directing Plaintiff to commence 
arbitration in California is denied.  The parties shall continue to submit status letters every sixty 
days per the Opinion. 
     Plaintiff is advised that because prosecution of his claims in California affects this matter, 
undue delay in may result in sanctions or prejudice, including dismissal of this matter for failure 
to prosecute.

LORNA G. SCHOFIELD, District Judge:                                       
    Defendants Andre Tomas Balazs, Andre Balazs Properties, Balazs Investors LLC and 
HotelsAB, LLC, move to (1) compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims in California or (2) stay this 
action pending such arbitration.  For the reasons stated below, this action is stayed pending any 
arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims in California.                          
I.   BACKGROUND                                                           
    The following facts are taken from the Complaint, the parties’ memoranda of law 
regarding Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and other submissions.  See Nicosia v. 
Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 229 (2d Cir. 2016).                       
    Plaintiff worked at the Chateau Marmont Hotel (“Chateau Marmont”) in Los Angeles, 
California, from May 2017 to March 2020, when the hotel ended his employment, citing staffing 
issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  On October 5, 2020, Plaintiff filed a charge of 
employment discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission 
(“EEOC”).  That charge was against Chateau Holdings, Ltd. a/k/a the Chateau Marmont hotel.  
The EEOC issued a right to sue letter on October 13, 2020.  Plaintiff filed this action on 
December 11, 2020, asserting sixteen causes of action under (1) federal and California statutes 
and (2) California common law.  Plaintiff did not assert claims against Chateau Holdings, Ltd. or 
Chateau Property Holdings, LLC.                                           
    Defendant Andre Balazs holds ownership interests in companies that own Chateau 
Property Holdings, LLC -- which is itself owned at least in part by Chateau Holdings, Ltd.  

Defendant HotelsAB, LLC is the management company for some hotels owned by Mr. Balazs, 
but not the Chateau Marmont.  Defendant Andre Balazs Properties is the d/b/a name for 
HotelsAB, LLC.  Defendant Balazs Investors LLC is the parent company of HotelsAB, LLC.   
    Before starting work at the Chateau Marmont, Plaintiff signed an arbitration agreement 
with Chateau Holdings, Ltd. (the “Arbitration Agreement”) containing the following clauses: 
    I hereby agree that any claims, disputes or controversies arising between me and 
    Chateau Holdings, Ltd. [the “Company”], which could give rise to a legal claim 
    relating to my employment with the Company or the termination thereof, 
    including the interpretation or application of this Dispute Resolution Procedure 
    and Mutual Binding Arbitration Agreement [“Agreement”], shall be addressed in 
    the following manner:                                                

    First, through good faith negotiation between me and the Company. Second, at 
    the Company’s option, through mediation administered by a mediator approved 
    by me and the Company and paid for by the Company. And third, if still not 
    resolved, by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act . . . . 

    This Agreement applies, without limitation, to claims regarding the employment 
    relationship, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breach of any 
    express or implied contract, fraud, defamation, detrimental reliance, termination, 
    harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (including harassment, discrimination, 
    and retaliation claims based on gender, race, national origin, religion, marital 
    status, age, medical condition, disability, sexual orientation, or any other 
    characteristic protected by law), and claims arising under the Defense of Trade 
    Secrets Ac[t], Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave 
    Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the 
    Fair Employment and Housing Act, the California Labor Code and other 
    applicable federal laws and regulations and state laws and regulations, if any, 
    addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other state statutory and 
    common law claims.                                                   

    I understand and agree that the arbitration will take place in Los Angeles County . 
    . . .                                                                
Defendants move to compel arbitration in Los Angeles or, alternatively, for a stay of this action 
pending any arbitration in that venue.                                    
II.  STANDARD                                                             
    The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) embodies a national policy favoring enforcement of 
arbitration agreements based on the desire to preserve the parties’ ability to arbitrate, not litigate, 
their disputes.  Doctor’s Assocs., Inc. v. Alemayehu, 934 F.3d 245, 250 (2d Cir. 2019).  Any 
doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.  
Holick v. Cellular Sales of N.Y., LLC, 802 F.3d 391, 395 (2d Cir. 2015); accord Coscarelli v. 

ESquared Hosp. LLC, 364 F. Supp. 3d 207, 215 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).             
    “[T]he FAA creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any 
arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act,” but “in evaluating whether the parties 
have entered into a valid arbitration agreement, the court must look to state law principles.”  Cap 
Gemini Ernst & Young, U.S., L.L.C. v. Nackel, 346 F.3d 360, 364 (2d Cir. 2003).  “As a result, 
prior to compelling arbitration, the district court must first determine two threshold issues that 
are governed by state rather than federal law: (1) Did the parties enter into a contractually valid 
arbitration agreement? and (2) If so, does the parties’ dispute fall within the scope of the 
arbitration agreement?”  Cap Gemini, 346 F.3d at 365 (2d Cir. 2003); accord Coscarelli, 364 F. 
Supp. 3d at 215.  The Court must then evaluate two additional issues: (3) whether Congress 

intended any federal statutory claims to be non-arbitrable and (4) if some, but not all, of the 
claims are arbitrable, whether to stay the balance of the proceedings pending arbitration.  
Abdullayeva v. Attending Homecare Servs. LLC, 928 F.3d 218, 221-22 (2d Cir. 2019).   
    Court proceedings must be stayed once the district court is “satisfied that the parties have 
agreed in writing to arbitrate an issue or issues underlying the district court proceeding.”  
Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d at 229.  In deciding this issue, courts apply a “standard similar to 
that applicable for a motion for summary judgment.”  Id.  Courts must “consider all relevant, 
admissible evidence submitted by the parties and contained in pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with . . . affidavits,” and must “draw all 

reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.”  Id.             
III.  DISCUSSION                                                          
 A.  Agreement to Arbitrate Claims at Issue                              
    State law governs whether (1) the parties entered into a valid arbitration agreement that 
(2) covers the claims at issue.  Cap Gemini, 346 F.3d at 365.  The parties’ memoranda of law 
assume that California law determines these questions, and “such implied consent . . . is 
sufficient to establish choice of law.”  Chau v. Lewis, 771 F.3d 118, 126 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal 
quotation marks omitted); accord Breaking Media, Inc. v. Evan Jowers, No. 21 Misc. 194, 2021 
WL 1299108, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 7, 2021).                                
      1.  Agreement to Arbitrate                                         

    Under California law, a court construing an arbitration agreement must focus on the 
parties’ “objective intent, as evidenced by the words of the contract, rather than the subjective 
intent of one of the parties,” DiCarlo v. MoneyLion, Inc., 988 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir. 2021) 
(quoting Reilly v. Inquest Tech., Inc., 218 Cal. App. 4th 536, 544 (2013)), so long as the 
“contract language is clear and explicit and does not lead to absurd results,” Revitch v. 
DIRECTV, LLC, 977 F.3d 713, 717 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Kashmiri v. Regents of Univ. of 
California, 156 Cal. App. 4th 809, 831 (2007), as modified (Nov. 15, 2007), as modified (Nov. 
28, 2007)).  When in doubt, “both federal and state law point to interpreting [an agreement] to 
permit arbitration.”  DiCarlo, 988 F.3d at 1152. (alteration in original) (citing Cal. Civ. Code § 
1643; Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626 (1985)).   
    Here, the Arbitration Agreement states, “[Plaintiff] hereby agree[s] that any claims, 
disputes or controversies arising between me and Chateau Holdings, Ltd. [the ‘Company’], 

which could give rise to a legal claim relating to my employment with the Company or the 
termination thereof . . . shall be addressed,” inter alia, “by binding arbitration under the Federal 
Arbitration Act.” (emphasis added).1  This language explicitly and unambiguously reflects the 
parties’ intent to arbitrate under the FAA all disputes arising from Plaintiff’s employment. 
         a.  The Arbitration Agreement’s Missing Signature               
    In response, Plaintiff first claims the Arbitration Agreement is invalid because, although 
he signed it, Chateau Holdings, Ltd. did not.  “[T]he writing memorializing an arbitration 
agreement need not be signed by both parties in order to be upheld as a binding arbitration 
agreement” because “it is not the presence or absence of a signature [on an agreement] which is 
dispositive; it is the presence or absence of evidence of an agreement to arbitrate which matters.”  

Serafin v. Balco Properties Ltd., LLC, 235 Cal. App. 4th 165, 176 (2015) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (emphasis removed); see also Batory v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 124 F. App’x 
530, 533 (9th Cir. 2005) (summary order) (“the Ninth Circuit clearly has recognized that ‘[w]hile 
the FAA requires a writing, it does not require that the writing be signed by the parties’” (quoting 
Nghiem v. NEC Elec., Inc., 25 F.3d 1437, 1439 (9th Cir. 1994)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  Factors confirming an employer’s intent to be bound by an unsigned arbitration 
agreement include the employer’s preparation of the agreement and its filing of a motion to stay 


1 The Arbitration Agreement contains two conditions to arbitration which neither party disputes 
were met: negotiation between Plaintiff and the Chateau Holdings, Ltd. and mediation at 
Chateau Holdings, Ltd.’s option.                                          
litigation and compel arbitration.  See Serafin, 235 Cal. App. 4th at 176-77.  Chateau Marmont, 
Ltd. prepared the Arbitration Agreement and affiliated Defendant Andre Balazs has moved to 
compel arbitration.  The evidence shows that Chateau Marmont, Ltd. intended to be bound by the 
Arbitration Agreement.                                                    

         b.  Unconscionability                                           
    Plaintiff also claims that the Arbitration Agreement is invalid because it is 
unconscionable under California law.  Unconscionability has both a “procedural” and a 
“substantive” element, the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining 
power and the latter on overly harsh or one-sided results that “shock the conscience.”  De La 
Torre v. CashCall, Inc., 5 Cal. 5th 966, 982 (2018).  Although both procedural and substantive 
unconscionability must be established, these factors are evaluated on a sliding scale -- a high 
degree of substantive unfairness may offset a low degree of procedural unfairness, and vice 
versa.  OTO, L.L.C. v. Kho, 8 Cal. 5th 111, 125-26, cert. denied sub nom. OTO, L.L.C. v. Ken 
Kho, 141 S. Ct. 85 (2020).  “[T]he ultimate issue in every case is whether the terms of the 

contract are sufficiently unfair, in view of all relevant circumstances, that a court should 
withhold enforcement.”  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).           
    The Arbitration Agreement is not procedurally unconscionable.  California courts have 
typically found arbitration agreements procedurally unconscionable if they (1) are contracts of 
adhesion offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, (2) involve a lack of negotiation or meaningful 
choice or (3) bury the allegedly unconscionable provision on a prolix printed form.  Id. 
(collecting cases).  The Arbitration Agreement (1) states that Plaintiff could opt out of the 
mandatory arbitration provisions within 30 days of receipt and that he would not be penalized for 
doing so, (2) states that if he did opt out, a manager would contact him to discuss his concerns 
and (3) prominently displays the relevant arbitration provisions on the first and second pages.  
California courts facing similar arbitration agreements have declined to find them procedurally 
unconscionable.  See, e.g., Sanchez v. Carmax Auto Superstores Cal., LLC, 224 Cal. App. 4th 
398, 403 (2014); Daniels v. Securitas Sec. Servs. USA, Inc., No. 18 Civ. 265, 2019 WL 4187383, 

at *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 5, 2019).  Plaintiff also claims that he was not provided certain materials 
specifying employee conduct and the standardized procedures that would be used in arbitration.  
This argument is unpersuasive because Plaintiff provides only attorney argument, which does not 
explain how any lack of access to those materials rendered the negotiation process so one-sided 
that it was procedurally unconscionable.                                  
    Nor is the Arbitration Agreement substantively unconscionable.  In Armendariz v. 
Found. Health Psychcare Servs., Inc., the California Supreme Court laid out factors to determine 
substantive unconscionability: whether (1) only one party is required to arbitrate; (2) recovery is 
limited for only one party; (3) the agreement permits adequate discovery; and (4) the agreement 
requires a neutral arbitrator and written decision.  24 Cal. 4th 83, 85, 99, 126 (2000); accord 

Daniels, 2019 WL 4187383, at *4.  The Arbitration Agreement contains bilateral obligations to 
arbitrate before a neutral arbitrator, does not limit recovery, permits discovery as permitted by 
the neutral arbitrator and requires a written decision explaining any award.  The Arbitration 
Agreement’s terms cannot be said to shock the conscience sufficient to find substantive 
unconscionability.  See De La Torre, 5 Cal. 5th at 982 (2018).            
    Although Plaintiff claims, solely by attorney argument, that the Chateau Marmont 
conditioned his employment on execution of the Arbitration Agreement, any such conditioning 
would not invalidate the Arbitration Agreement, which permitted him to opt out without penalty.  
See Daniels, 2019 WL 4187373, at *4 (“Pursuant to Armdendariz, even if [defendant] told 
Plaintiff that she had to sign the [arbitration agreement] as a condition of employment, that alone 
is not enough to make the agreement unconscionable” where the plaintiff could opt out).   
    Plaintiff also claims that a provision of the Arbitration Agreement requiring him to (1) 
pay his own attorneys’ fees unless fee-shifting was permitted by statute and (2) contribute to 

arbitration fees up to the amount he would have spent litigating in court is unconscionable.  
Similar provisions are routinely upheld by courts applying California law.  See, e.g., Armendariz, 
24 Cal. 4th at 90 (permitting arbitration agreements that require employee to bear costs of the 
type that would be incurred in court); Tompkins v. 23andMe, Inc., 840 F.3d 1016, 1026 (9th Cir. 
2016) (holding valid arbitration agreements that did not impose unaffordable fees that would 
thwart a party’s ability to arbitrate).                                   
         c.  Plaintiff’s Remaining Arguments                             
    Plaintiff also claims that the Arbitration Agreement is invalidated by California Labor 
Code § 432.6, which prohibits any employment agreement requiring employees to waive the 
protections of the California Fair Housing and Employment Act.  This argument is unpersuasive 

because that provision (1) does not invalidate arbitration agreements otherwise enforceable under 
the FAA, Cal. Lab. Code § 432.6(f) and (2) applies only to employment contracts entered into, 
modified or extended on or after January 1, 2020 -- several years after the Arbitration 
Agreement’s execution.  Cal. Lab. Code § 432.6(h).  Plaintiff also claims that employment-
related disputes cannot be sent to arbitration under the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  This argument 
fails because Plaintiff relies on overturned precedent.  See Duffield v. Robertson Stephens & Co., 
144 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir. 1998), overruled by EEOC v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps, 
345 F.3d 742 (9th Cir. 2003) (“In Duffield, we held that for Title VII claims, the 1991 Act 
precludes enforcement of arbitration agreements entered into as a condition of employment. . . . 
On reconsideration en banc, we now conclude that our holding in Duffield was in error”).   
      2.  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement to Plaintiff’s Claims   
    Courts presumptively decide the question of whether an arbitration agreement applies to a 

particular dispute.  Doctor’s Assocs., Inc., 934 F.3d at 250-51.  This presumption may be 
overcome where the parties “clearly and unmistakably” agree that the arbitrator should resolve 
the agreement’s scope.  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because an arbitration agreement 
rarely “directly state[s] whether the arbitrator or the court will decide the issue of arbitrability,” 
courts may infer the parties’ intent from other provisions of the agreement.  Metro. Life Ins. Co. 
v. Bucsek, 919 F.3d 184, 191 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 256 (2019).  “Broad language 
expressing an intention to arbitrate all aspects of all disputes supports the inference of an 
intention to arbitrate arbitrability, and the clearer it is from the agreement that the parties 
intended to arbitrate the particular dispute presented, the more logical and likely the inference 
that they intended to arbitrate the arbitrability of the dispute.”  Id. (collecting cases).   

    The Arbitration Agreement broadly provides that it applies to:       
  •  “any claims, disputes or controversies arising between [Plaintiff] Chateau Holdings, Ltd. 
    [the ‘Company’] which could give rise to a legal claim relating to [Plaintiff’s] 
    employment with the Company or the termination thereof”;             

  •  “claims regarding the employment relationship, trade secrets, unfair competition, 
    compensation, breach of any express or implied contract, fraud, defamation, detrimental 
    reliance, termination, harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (including harassment, 
    discrimination, and retaliation claims based on gender, race, national origin, religion, 
    marital status, age, medical condition, disability, sexual orientation, or any other 
    characteristic protected by law)”;                                   

  •  claims arising under various federal statutes; and                  

  •  “other applicable federal laws and regulations and state laws and regulations, if any, 
    addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other state statutory and common 
    law claims.”                                                         
The plain language of these provisions establishes that the parties intended to arbitrate all issues 
arising from Plaintiff’s employment.  See Revitch, 977 F.3d at 717 (contracts should be 
construed in accordance with their plain meaning under California law).  The provisions’ breadth 
also establishes that the parties intended the arbitrator to resolve whether Plaintiff’s claims fall 
under the Arbitration Agreement.2                                         
 B.  Defendants’ Interest in Compelling Arbitration                      
    The Complaint alleges misconduct resulting from actions of the Chateau Marmont’s 
employees.  The counter-party to the Arbitration Agreement is Chateau Holdings, Ltd., which 

has an ownership interest Chateau Holdings, LLC.  The Defendant with a related interest is 
Andre Balazs, who holds ownership interests in companies that hold interests in Chateau 
Property Holdings, LLC.                                                   
    A signatory to an arbitration clause is estopped from refusing to arbitrate against a non-

2 The Arbitration Agreement also encompasses each of the Complaint’s claims.  The Complaint 
asserts causes of action for employment discrimination under federal law (Count I); intentional 
infliction of emotional distress (Count II); a hostile work environment pursuant to federal and 
California law (Count III); invasion of privacy (Count IV); violations of due process (Count V); 
defamation (Count VI); workers’ compensation violations under federal and California law 
(Count VII); federal insurance fraud (Count VIII); copyright infringement (Count IX); sexual 
harassment in violation of federal and California law (Count X); federal disability discrimination 
(Count XI); bullying and workplace harassment under California law (Count XII); retaliation 
under federal law (Count XIII); negligence (Count XIV); breach of contract (Count XV) and 
unjust enrichment (Count XVI).  Each of these claims rests on activity allegedly taken by the 
Chateau Marmont or its employees in the scope of Plaintiff’s employment, and such activities 
plainly fall within the Arbitration Agreement’s expansive language.  See, e.g., Mehler v. 
Terminix Int’l Co. L.P., 205 F.3d 44, 49 (2d Cir. 2000) (finding an agreement to arbitrate “any 
controversy or claim between [the parties] arising out of or relating to” a contract to be 
“classically broad”) (internal quotations omitted); accord Lewis v. ANSYS, Inc., No. 19 Civ. 
10427, 2021 WL 1199072, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2021) (finding claims for discrimination, 
retaliation and defamation fell under agreement to arbitrate “any dispute or claim arising out of 
or in any way related to” the plaintiff’s employment) (internal quotations omitted).  The parties 
identify no federal statutory claims that are non-arbitrable.             
signatory where (1) “the issues the nonsignatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are 
intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party has signed” and (2) there is “a 
relationship among the parties of a nature that justifies a conclusion that the party which agreed 
to arbitrate with another entity should be estopped from denying an obligation to arbitrate a 

similar dispute” with the non-signatory.  Ragone v. Atl. Video at Manhattan Ctr., 595 F.3d 115, 
127 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotations omitted); accord Doe v Trump Corp., 453 F. Supp. 3d 
634, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).  “When assessing relationships between signatories and non-
signatories to an arbitration agreement, the Second Circuit has noted that estoppel cases have 
tended to share a common feature in that the non-signatory party asserting estoppel has had some 
sort of corporate relationship to a signatory party; that is, [the Circuit] has applied estoppel in 
cases involving subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and other related business entities.”  Meridian 
Autonomous Inc. v. Coast Autonomous LLC, No. 17 Civ. 5846, 2020 WL 496078, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2020) (internal quotations omitted).  The purpose of equitable estoppel is to 
avoid an unfair result:  permitting a signatory to an arbitration agreement to evade arbitration by 

suing non-signatory defendants for claims that are based on the same facts and inherently 
inseparable from arbitrable claims.  See Sokol Holdings, Inc. v. BMB Munai, Inc., 542 F.3d 354, 
361 (2d Cir. 2008); accord Meridian Autonomous, 2020 WL 496078, at *2.    
    Here, the issues that the non-signatory Defendants seek to resolve in arbitration are 
identical to those subject to arbitration between Plaintiff and the Chateau Marmont, as both arise 
entirely from conduct subject to the Arbitration Agreement.  There is also a degree of affiliation 
between Defendant Andre Balazs and the Chateau Marmont.  And permitting Plaintiff to evade 
arbitration by filing claims against non-signatories to the Arbitration Agreement would create the 
unfair result that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is intended to prevent.  Accordingly, Plaintiff 
may not proceed on his claims in this proceeding until his claims are resolved in arbitration. 
   C.  Whether to Compel Arbitration 
      The FAA provides that any arbitration proceedings resulting from a motion to compel 
arbitration “shall be within the district in which the petition for an order directing such 
arbitration is filed.”  9 U.S.C. § 4.  However, the Arbitration Agreement provides that any 
arbitration “will take place in Los Angeles County.”  Although the Second Circuit has not 
addressed this situation, courts in this district have persuasively reasoned that they should decline 
to compel arbitration in a venue not authorized by statute and stay proceedings pursuant to 
9 U.S.C. § 3 while awaiting the outcome of any arbitration in the venue specified by the 
agreement.  See, e.g., Pilkington N. Am., Inc. v. Mitsui Sumitomo Ins. Co.  of Am., No. 18 Civ. 
8152, 2021 WL 37691, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 5, 2021); L. Offs.  of Joseph L. Manson III v. Keiko 
Aoki, No. 19 Civ. 04392, 2020 WL 767466, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2020) (collecting cases). 
Resolution of Plaintiff’s claims against Defendants must await any resolution of those same 
claims in arbitration.  For that reason, a stay is appropriate. 
IV.    CONCLUSION 
      For the reasons given above, Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration is denied. 
Defendants’ motion to stay this case pending the completion of any arbitration in California is 
granted.  All deadlines are stayed and all conferences are adjourned sine die.  Sixty days after 
the date of this Opinion and order, and every sixty days thereafter, the parties shall file a joint 
letter apprising the Court of the status of any arbitration in California.  The Clerk of Court is 
respectfully directed to close Docket Entry No. 17.
