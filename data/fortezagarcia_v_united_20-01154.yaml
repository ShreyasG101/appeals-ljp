outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Ángel Forteza-García''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that, in light of United States v. Davis, his predicate conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2114(a) does not qualify as a ''crime of violence'' under § 924(c)(3)(A)''s force clause, and therefore his conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 924(j) is unconstitutional.

  2. Appellant contended that the record does not establish that his predicate § 2114(a) offense was for the aggravated form of the offense (wounding or placing life in jeopardy), and thus the district court was required to treat his predicate offense as the simple form, which he argued does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.

  3. Appellant argued that even the aggravated form of § 2114(a) is indivisible as between wounding, placing life in jeopardy, and repeated commission, and therefore does not categorically qualify as a ''crime of violence'' under § 924(c)(3)(A).

  4. Appellant contended that his conviction under § 924(j) cannot stand because he was convicted as an aider and abettor, and aiding and abetting liability does not satisfy the force clause of § 924(c)(3)(A).'
