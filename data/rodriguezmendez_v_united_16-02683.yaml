outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Julio A. Rodríguez-Méndez''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that his conviction for felon-in-possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because he had already been prosecuted in Puerto Rico Commonwealth court for carrying a weapon without a license based on the same conduct, and that the Supreme Court''s decision in Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle should apply retroactively to bar the federal prosecution.

  2. Appellant contended that his sentence as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) was unlawful because, following Johnson v. United States (Johnson II), his three prior convictions for robbery of a motor vehicle under Article 173B of the Puerto Rico Penal Code no longer qualified as predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act.'
