I.   Introduction                                                         

Plaintiff Scott Cannon (“Cannon”), individually and as the personal representative of the 
estate of Blaise Cannon (“Blaise”), has filed this lawsuit against Defendant Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (“BCBS”) alleging various state law claims arising from BCBS’s 
denial of health benefits.  D. 1-1.  Defendant has moved for summary judgment.  D. 35.  For the 
reasons stated below, the Court ALLOWS the motion.                        
II.  Standard of Review                                                   
The Court grants summary judgment where there is no genuine dispute as to any material 
fact and the undisputed facts demonstrate that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter 
of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “A fact is material if it carries with it the potential to affect the 
outcome of the suit under applicable law.”  Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 
217 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir. 2000).  The movant bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a 
genuine issue of material fact.  Carmona v. Toledo, 215 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2000); see Celotex 
v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  If the movant meets its burden, the non-moving party may 
not rest on the allegations or denials in its pleadings, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 
242, 256 (1986), but must come forward with specific admissible facts showing that there is a 

genuine issue for trial,  see Borges ex rel. S.M.B.W. v. Serrano-Isern, 605 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2010).  
The Court “view[s] the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, drawing reasonable 
inferences in his favor.”  Noonan v. Staples, Inc., 556 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2009).  
III.  Factual Background                                                  

The  following  facts  are  drawn  from  Defendant’s  submission  of  material  facts  and 
documents cited therein, D. 37, and are undisputed.1                      
Blaise was the domestic partner of a SessionM, Inc. (“SessionM”) employee.  D. 37 ¶ 12.  
In March 2020, he was insured through a group policy of health insurance (the “Policy”) issued 
by BCBS to SessionM employees and their covered dependents, including domestic partners.  
Id. ¶¶ 1, 9, 12.  On March 18, 2020, Blaise sought coverage under the Policy for a Wixela Inhub 
inhaler to treat his asthma.  Id. ¶¶ 2, 23.  On March 25, 2020, BCBS denied the request because 
there was no evidence that Blaise had tried other inhalers as the Policy required.  Id. ¶¶ 27–28.  On 
March 31, 2020, Blaise died from complications related to his asthma.  Id. ¶ 3.  



1 Plaintiff failed to file a response to Defendant’s statement of material facts as required.  
Accordingly, Defendant’s statement of material facts, D. 37, is deemed admitted.  D. 51 at 2; 
Stonkus v. City of Brockton Sch. Dep’t, 322 F.3d 97, 102 (1st Cir. 2003) (providing that “material 
facts of record set forth in the statement required to be served by the moving party will be deemed 
for purposes of the motion to be admitted by the opposing parties unless controverted by the 
statement required to be served by opposing parties”) (quoting D. Mass. L.R. 56.1).  
IV.  Procedural History                                                   

Cannon instituted this action in Middlesex Superior Court alleging six state law claims:  
declaratory judgment regarding BCBS (Count I); breach of contract (Count II); bad faith (Count 
III); wrongful death (Count IV); punitive damages (Count V) and loss of consortium (Count VI).  
D. 1-1 ¶¶ 14–44.  BCBS removed the action to this Court, D. 1, and moved to dismiss the 
complaint shortly thereafter.  D. 7.  The Court heard the parties on that motion, D. 24, and, while 
reserving on the motion, ordered a brief period of discovery limited to the BCBS policy issued to 
Blaise and related correspondence.  D. 25.  Following this discovery, the Court denied the motion 
to dismiss without prejudice to BCBS raising the issue of ERISA preemption in a motion for 
summary judgment.  D. 30 at 7.  BCBS now moves for summary judgement on the basis that all 
six state law claims are preempted by ERISA.  D. 35.  Cannon “does not contest here” that ERISA 
preempts his claims for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, bad faith and loss of consortium 
(Counts I, II, III and VI).  D. 50 at 2.  Instead, Cannon argues only that his claim for wrongful 
death and his corresponding claim for punitive damages (Counts IV and V) survive.  Id. at 1–2.  

The Court therefore limits its analysis to those claims.                  
V.   Discussion                                                           

A.   ERISA Preemption                                                

BCBS argues that Cannon’s two remaining claims also are preempted by ERISA.  D. 36 at 
9–17.  “ERISA preemption analysis involves two central questions:  (1) whether the plan at issue 
is an ‘employee benefit plan’ and (2) whether the cause of action ‘relates to’ this employee benefit 
plan.”  Hampers v. W.R. Grace & Co., Inc., 202 F.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting McMahon v. 
Digital Equip. Corp., 162 F.3d 28, 36 (1st Cir. 1998)).  The parties agree that the Policy in question 
is a benefit plan covered by ERISA.  D. 36 at 2; D. 50 at 1–2.  The question is therefore whether 
Cannon’s wrongful death and punitive damages claims “relate” to that Policy.      
With exceptions not relevant here,2 § 514(a) of ERISA preempts “any and all State laws 
insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.”  29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).  
“The term ‘State Law’ includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action having 

the effect of law, of any State.”  29 U.S.C. § 1144(c)(1).  The Supreme Court has recognized “the 
expansive sweep of the pre-emption clause,” Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 47 
(1987), and has articulated that, “[t]he phrase ‘relate to’ [is to be] given its broad common-sense 
meaning, such that a state law ‘relate[s] to’ a benefit plan ‘in the normal sense of the phrase, if it 
has a connection with or reference to such a plan.’”  Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 
U.S. 724, 739 (1985) (quoting Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 96–97 (1983)).  “In 
adopting § 514(a), Congress deliberately rejected narrower preemption language directed at state 
laws relating to the specific subjects covered by ERISA, choosing instead to supplant all state laws 
that relate to ERISA-regulated plans.”  Hampers, 202 F.3d at 49 (citation and internal quotation 

marks omitted).                                                           
Section 514(a) is satisfied if “a court must evaluate or interpret the terms of the ERISA-
regulated plan to determine liability under the state law cause of action.”  Hampers, 202 F.3d at 
52; see Harris v. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Inc., 208 F.3d 274, 281 (1st Cir. 2000) (concluding 
that a state law claim is preempted if “the trier of fact necessarily would be required to consult the 
ERISA plan to resolve the plaintiff’s claims”).  “A law is preempted ‘even if the law is not 

2 Section 514(a) is qualified by a “savings clause,” which precludes from preemption any 
“state law[s] . . . which regulate insurance, banking, or securities . . . .”  29 U.S.C. § 1144(b).  
Cannon does not raise the savings clause and “it is the parties[’] burden, not the court[’s], to 
develop arguments in support of their claims/positions, with citation to relevant legal authority.”  
Lovern v. Astrue, No. 09-40098-TSH, 2011 WL 4621455, at *6 (D. Mass. Sept. 29, 2011).   
specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect.’”  Guerra-Delago v. 
Popular, Inc., 774 F.3d 776, 781 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting Zipperer v. Raytheon Co., 493 F.3d 50, 
53 (1st Cir. 2007)).  In addition, state law claims relate to an ERISA plan if they arise from the 
enforcement of rights under an ERISA-regulated plan.  Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 52–57; see Hampers, 
202 F.3d at 49–50 (compiling cases); Turner v. Fallon Cmty. Health Plan, Inc., 127 F.3d 196, 199 

(1st Cir. 1997) (observing that “[i]t would be difficult to think of a state law that ‘relates’ more 
closely to an employee benefit plan than one that affords remedies for breach of obligations under 
that plan”).                                                              
Cannon’s claims for wrongful death (Count IV) and punitive damages (Count V) are 
preempted both because the Court would be required to consult the Policy to resolve them and 
because they arose from the alleged improper denial of benefits.  Each claim relies upon the same 
premise:  that Defendant improperly denied Blaise a particular health benefit, thus resulting in his 
death.  Determining whether that denial was improper requires the Court to consult the Policy.3  
Plaintiff posits that its wrongful death claim cannot be preempted because the Massachusetts 

wrongful death statute has no regulatory effect on insurance, D. 50 at 3, but § 514(a) does not limit 
ERISA’s preemptive reach to statutes directly regulating insurance and instead covers “state 
claims to enforce rights under an ERISA plan or obtain damages for the wrongful withholding of 
those rights.”  Turner, 127 F.3d at 199.  Claims for wrongful death and punitive damages resulting 
from an allegedly improper denial of benefits under an ERISA plan are precluded on this basis.  
See e.g., id. at 198–200 (concluding that wrongful death and other state law claims arose from a 



3  Cannon  argues  the  wrongful  death  inquiry  would  instead  be  directed  to  BCBS’s 
negligence, D. 50 at 4, but fails to identify any duty BCBS owed Cannon other than the duty 
prescribed by the Policy itself.                                          
denial of benefits and were thus preempted by ERISA); Andrews-Clarke v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 
157 F. Supp. 2d 93, 104–05 (D. Mass. 2001) (same).                        
Cannon also argues that its wrongful death and punitive damages claims are not preempted 
because the Massachusetts wrongful death statute provides a distinct form of relief.  D. 50 at 3–6.  
According to Cannon, a wrongful death claim cannot be preempted by ERISA because an ERISA 

plan participant or beneficiary could never bring such a claim.  Id. at 4.4  But the wrongful death 
claim is an action for damages related to a breach of plan and is therefore precisely the type of 
alternative enforcement mechanism disallowed under ERISA § 502(a).  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a).  “The 
relief expressly provided [under ERISA] is to secure benefits under the plan rather than damages 
for a breach of the plan.”  Turner, 127 F.3d at 198.  “This is not a minor technicality:  damage 
awards may increase effective coverage but may also add significantly to the costs of coverage.”  
Id. at 198–99.  “[S]tate laws which furnish alternative enforcement mechanisms threaten the 
uniformity that Congress labored to achieve and thus are preempted by ERISA.”  Carpenters Loc. 
Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guard Co., 215 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir. 2000); see Danca, 185 F.3d at 

4–6 (holding that state law tort claims alleging improper processing of claim benefits under ERISA 
plan were preempted since all state-law-based attacks on this conduct would amount to an 
“alternative enforcement mechanism”); Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 53–54 (concluding that to allow 
punitive damages for a failure to pay benefits would be at odds with Congress’s refusal to allow 
punitive damages for benefit claims under ERISA).                         


4 BCBS posits that the Massachusetts wrongful death statute does not provide a distinct 
form of relief because it is derivative in nature and belongs to the decedent and his estate.  D. 51 
at 2.  The Court need not reach the issue because, derivative or not, the wrongful death and punitive 
damages claims arise from the allegedly improper denial of benefits under an ERISA plan and are 
therefore preempted.                                                      
B.   ERISA Claim                                                     

Even assuming arguendo that the complaint asserted an ERISA claim, BCBS would still 
be entitled to summary judgment.  D. 36 at 14–16.  ERISA preemption “does not always entitle 
the defendant to dismissal because there is the possibility that the plaintiff’s complaint may state 
a valid ERISA claim.”  Andrews-Clarke, 157 F. Supp. 2d at 106 (citing Fitzgerald v. Codex Corp., 
882 F.2d 586, 589 (1st Cir. 1989)).  Section 502(a) provides that a civil action may be brought by 
“[a] participant or beneficiary.”  29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B).  A participant or beneficiary may sue 
under ERISA to “recover benefits due to them under the terms of their plan, enforce their rights 
under the plan, or clarify their rights to future benefits under the plan.”  Id.  
In Counts IV and V (or even elsewhere in the complaint), Cannon does not seek benefits 
due under the Policy but rather damages for the allegedly “improper refusal of an insurer . . . to 
authorize treatment.”  Andrews-Clarke, 984 F. Supp. at 59.  But, as already discussed, ERISA 
“does not create compensatory or punitive damage remedies where an administrator of a plan fails 
to provide the benefits due under that plan.”  Hampers, 202 F.3d at 51.5  Accordingly, at least for 

this reason, Cannon also has failed to state an ERISA claim.              
VI.  Conclusion                                                           

For the foregoing reasons, the Court ALLOWS BCBS’s motion for summary judgment.  
D. 35.                                                                    
So Ordered.                                                          

                                   /s Denise J. Casper               
                                   United States District Judge      

5 BCBS also argues that Cannon did not exhaust all administrative remedies.  D. 36 at 16–
17.  “A plaintiff who wishes to raise an ERISA claim in federal court must first exhaust all 
administrative remedies that the fiduciary provides.”  Medina v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 588 F.3d 41, 
47 (1st Cir. 2009).  The Court need not reach this issue, however, because it otherwise concludes 
that BCBS is entitled to summary judgment for the reasons explained above.

I.   Introduction                                                         

Plaintiff Scott Cannon (“Cannon”), individually and as the personal representative of the 
estate of Blaise Cannon (“Blaise”), has filed this lawsuit against Defendant Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. (“BCBS”) alleging various state law claims arising from BCBS’s 
denial of health benefits.  D. 1-1.  BCBS has moved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 12(b)(6).  D. 7.  For the reasons stated below, the Court DENIES the motion.  
II.  Standard of Review                                                   
On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant 
to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court must determine if the facts alleged 
“plausibly narrate a claim for relief.”  Schatz v. Republican State Leadership Comm., 669 F.3d 50, 
55 (1st Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).  Reading the complaint “as a whole,” the Court must conduct 
a two-step, context-specific inquiry.  García-Catalán v. United States, 734 F.3d 100, 103 (1st Cir. 
2013).  First, the Court must perform a close reading of the claim to distinguish the factual 
allegations from the conclusory legal allegations contained therein.  Id.  Factual allegations must 
be accepted as true, while conclusory legal conclusions are not entitled credit.  Id.  Second, the 
Court must determine whether the factual allegations present a “reasonable inference that the 

defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Haley v. City of Boston, 657 F.3d 39, 46 (1st Cir. 
2011) (citation omitted).  In sum, the complaint must provide sufficient factual allegations for the 
Court to find the claim “plausible on its face.”  García-Catalán, 734 F.3d at 103 (quoting Ashcroft 
v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).                                      
Although the “consideration of documents not attached to the complaint, or not expressly 
incorporated therein” is generally improper under Rule 12(b)(6), “courts have made narrow 
exceptions for documents the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; for official 
public records; for documents central to plaintiffs’ claim; or for documents sufficiently referred to 
in the complaint.”  Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1993).  The Court may review the “relevant 

entirety of a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint, even though not 
attached to the complaint, without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.”  Clorox 
Co. P.R. v. Proctor & Gamble Com. Co., 228 F.3d 24, 32 (1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).   
III.  Factual Background and Procedural History                           

Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are drawn from the allegations in Cannon’s 
complaint.  D. 1-1.                                                       
As alleged by Cannon, BCBS issued Blaise a “policy of health insurance” (the “Policy”), 
which remained in force as of March of 2020.  Id. ¶¶ 7–8.  That month, Blaise sought coverage for 
a Wixela Inhub inhaler to treat his asthma.  Id. ¶ 9.  BCBS denied coverage pursuant the Policy.  
Id. ¶ 10.  Blaise subsequently died due to complications related to his asthma on March 31, 2020.  
Id. ¶ 12.                                                                 
Cannon instituted this action in Middlesex Superior Court alleging six state law claims: 
declaratory judgment with regard to BCBS (Count I); breach of contract (Count II); bad faith 
(Count III); wrongful death (Count IV); punitive damages (Count V); and loss of consortium 

(Count VI).  D. 1-1 ¶¶ 14–44.  BCBS removed the action to this Court, D. 1, and moved to dismiss 
the complaint shortly thereafter.  D. 7.  The Court heard the parties on the pending motion and, 
while reserving on the motion, ordered a brief period of discovery limited to the BCBS policy 
issued to Blaise and related correspondence.  D. 25.  Following limited discovery, the parties 
submitted supplemental memoranda.  See D. 27; D. 28.                      
IV.  Discussion                                                           

BCBS argues that Cannon’s complaint should be dismissed because his state law claims 
are preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 
§§ 1001 et seq. (“ERISA”) and that Cannon has failed to state a claim under ERISA.  D. 14 at 1–
2.  Central to BCBS’s argument are exhibits to its motion to dismiss, which purportedly include 
the Policy cited in the complaint.  See D. 8-1.  Cannon responds that the Court cannot consider 
these exhibits on a 12(b)(6) motion and insists that they are “incomplete and unauthenticated.”  
D. 12 at 1.                                                               
Although a court may consider some documents on a 12(b)(6) motion, it is still incumbent 
on the defendant to present sufficient indicia of authenticity as to any proffered exhibits.  For 
example, in Prouty v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins., 997 F. Supp. 2d 85, 86, 88–89 (D. Mass. 
2014), two defendants, a former employer and an insurer, moved to dismiss a complaint on the 
grounds that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim under ERISA; in support of their motion, the 
defendants produced a copy of the summary plan description (“SPD”) referenced in the plaintiff’s 
complaint.  The plaintiff argued that the SPD could not be considered because they “were not 
properly authenticated as true copies of the SPD.”  Id. at 89.  The defendants responded that the 
documents had been properly authenticated by an employee of the insurer, pointing to a declaration 
confirming same.  Id.  The court concluded that “[t]he SPD produced by Defendants ha[d] 

sufficient indicia of authenticity to permit its consideration in connection with these motions to 
dismiss.”  Id.                                                            
Similarly, in Blay v. Zipcar, 716 F. Supp. 2d 115, 118 (D. Mass. 2010), a plaintiff moved 
to strike documents submitted with defendant Zipcar’s motion to dismiss, arguing the documents 
were “not authenticated.”  Zipcar responded that, “as is common practice, it [ ] submitted a 
lawyer’s sworn affidavit verifying the documents and even attache[d] two affidavits from Zipcar 
employees confirming the documents’ authenticity.”  Id.  The court denied the plaintiff’s motion 
to strike.  Id.                                                           
Here, the complaint alleges that BCBS “provided a policy of health insurance to Decedent, 

Blaise Cannon,” D. 1-1 ¶ 7; that “[t]he Policy was in good standing and in force as of March 2020,” 
id. ¶ 8; that “Blaise Cannon sought coverage . . . under the Policy,” id. ¶ 9; and that “Blaise Cannon 
was denied coverage . . . under the Policy.”  Id. ¶10.  Cannon’s extensive reference to, and reliance 
upon, Blaise’s health insurance policy—which was not attached to the complaint—opened the 
door for BCBS to submit exhibits concerning same for the Court’s consideration on a 12(b)(6) 
motion.  See Watterson, 987 F.2d at 3.                                    
This does not relieve BCBS of the obligation to ensure that any documents submitted to 
the Court for consideration possess sufficient indicia of authenticity.  See Prouty, 997 F. Supp. 2d 
at 89; Blay, 716 F. Supp. 2d at 118.  Having reviewed the exhibits submitted by BCBS, the Court 
cannot conclude on the present record that they possess sufficient indicia of authenticity to warrant 
consideration at this stage.  BCBS has submitted an assortment of documents in support of its 
motion to dismiss, including what BCBS’s counsel describes as excerpts of the Policy issued to 
Blaise as the domestic partner of an employee of a company called SessionM Inc. (“SessionM”).  
D. 14 at 2; see D. 8-1 at 1–32.  Specifically, BCBS has produced (1) a subscriber certificate 

detailing plan benefits for individuals receiving their health insurance through SessionM, D. 8-1 
at 1–24; (2) BCBS’s “Pharmacy Medical Policy” on asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, id. at 25–29; and (3) a “Premium Account Agreement” which “describes the terms of the 
arrangement between Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Inc. . . . and the Account to 
provide health care benefits for the Account’s covered employees and their covered dependents.” 
1  D. 8-1 at 30, 30–32.                                                   
While these documents appear to pertain to a health insurance policy available to SessionM 
employees and their domestic partners, BCBS’s assertion is more specific, i.e., that Blaise 
subscribed to the same as the domestic partner of a SessionM employee.  D. 14 at 2.  None of these 

exhibits contain information linking the proffered policy documents or SessionM specifically to 
Blaise.  See D. 8-1 at 1–32.  Any such connection arises from a statement in BCBS counsel’s 
memorandum of law that “Blaise obtained coverage through the Plan because his domestic partner 
was an employee of SessionM and a participant in the Plan.”  D. 14 at 2.  To support this assertion, 
BCBS cites an attachment to the group health insurance plan issued to SessionM titled “Domestic 
Partner Eligibility.”  See 8-1 at 24.  But all this document shows is that a subscriber of the proffered 


1 BCBS also submitted correspondence concerning Blaise’s claim for the Wixela Inhub 
inhaler.  D. 8-1 at 33–52.  As these documents seem to consist of claim correspondence not 
referenced in the complaint, the Court will not consider them here on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  See 
Watterson, 987 F.2d at 3.                                                 
health plan “may enroll a domestic partner for coverage under his or her membership,” not that 
Blaise’s  health  insurance  policy—i.e.,  the  Policy  referenced  in  the  complaint—was  issued 
pursuant to the terms of the SessionM plan.2  See id.; see also Setterlund v. Potter, 597 F. Supp. 
2d 167, 171 (D. Mass. 2008) (explaining how, in the summary judgment context, “the appearance 
of authenticity is not enough” and that “it is not sufficient for [ ] counsel merely to assert, in the 

memorandum of law . . . , that the documents are authentic”).             
The exhibits produced by BCBS with its supplemental memorandum do not allay the 
Court’s concerns as to the gaps in the record.  See D. 27-1; D. 27-2; D. 27-3; D. 27-4.  According 
to BCBS, these exhibits are “screen shots of its member and enrollment systems showing that 
Cannon was insured solely as a dependent of a SessionM Inc. [ ] employee under the SessionM 
group health plan.”  D. 27 at 2.  Only two of these screenshots list Blaise Cannon’s name, however.  
See D. 27-3; D. 27-4 at 1.  And while they note Blaise’s status as a “dependent” or “domestic 
partner,” the screenshots’ connection to SessionM is not apparent from the face of the documents.  
See D. 27-3; D. 27-4 at 1.                                                

Cannon also raises a number of questions concerning these screenshots.  According to an 
affidavit by Cannon’s counsel, these documents were produced in response to discovery requests 
seeking information as to the BCBS policy issued to Blaise.  D. 29-1 ¶ 2.  One of these screenshots, 
D. 27-1, appears to note an entry related to subscriber benefits on March 17, 2020 under the 
heading  “Activity  History.”    Cannon’s  counsel  asked  BCBS  whether  there  were  additional 
documents  concerning  this  and  other  entries  depicted  in  the  screenshot;  BCBS’s  counsel 
responded, “[t]here are no records relating to the entries in this screen shot . . . .  The entry for 


2  Relatedly,  the  Court  notes  that  the  excerpts  of  the  Premium  Account  Agreement, 
produced by BCBS, do not expressly name SessionM as the counterparty to the agreement.  See 
D. 8-1 at 30–32.                                                          
3/17/20 reflects the date that the insured’s benefits were updated for the annual renewal date for 
the group plan of 4/1/20.”  D. 29-1 ¶¶ 3–4, 6.                            
Had  BCBS  submitted  an  affidavit  or  declaration  explaining  the  significance  of  the 
proffered policy documents and verifying that they concerned the health insurance policy through 
which Blaise sought coverage for the Wixela Inhub inhaler, D. 1-1 ¶ 9, the Court may have 

considered the exhibits and reached the ERISA preemption arguments raised by BCBS’s motion 
to dismiss.  See Prouty, 997 F. Supp. 2d at 89; Blay, 716 F. Supp. 2d at 118.  However, in light of 
the parties’ submissions to date, the Court is unable to do so.  Accordingly, the Court denies 
BCBS’s motion to dismiss without prejudice to BCBS raising the issue of ERISA preemption in a 
motion for summary judgment.                                              
V.   Conclusion                                                           

For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES BCBS’s motion to dismiss, D. 7.  Given that 
resolution of the ERISA preemption issue may be dispositive here, see Danca v. Private Health 
Care Sys., Inc., 185 F.3d 1, 4–6 (1st Cir. 1999), the Court ORDERS the following schedule for a 
motion for summary judgment on the issue of ERISA preemption.  Fact discovery, limited to 
matters bearing upon this issue, may be conducted through January 31, 2024.  BCBS may file any 
motion for summary judgment on ERISA preemption by February 28, 2024.  Cannon’s opposition 
to same will be due by March 20, 2024.                                    
So Ordered.
