reason_for_appeal: '=== David Monk''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in dismissing his § 10(b) securities fraud claims for failure to adequately plead loss causation, contending that he sufficiently alleged that misleading proxy statements caused him to forfeit his appraisal rights and suffer economic loss.

  2. Appellant contended that the district court erred in holding that certain alleged misstatements and omissions in the proxy materials were not actionable, specifically challenging the court’s conclusions regarding statements about the grouping of games for revenue estimates, the failure to disclose MIIM’s revenue, and statements characterizing the merger as fair.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred in its determination that he failed to adequately plead actionable misstatements or omissions with respect to the preparation of financial projections, the projections themselves, and the fairness opinions in the proxy statements.

  4. Appellant asserted that the district court erred in its analysis of reliance, maintaining that he was entitled to invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption because he relied on the market price in deciding not to exercise his appraisal rights.

  5. Appellant claimed that the district court erred in dismissing his control person claims under § 20(a) on the basis that there was no primary violation.

  6. Appellant argued that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for leave to amend the complaint to add Altimeo Asset Management as an additional named plaintiff without providing an explanation.'
