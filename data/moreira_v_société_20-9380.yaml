reason_for_appeal: '=== Plaintiffs-Appellants (Moreira et al.)''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Plaintiffs argued that the district courts erred in holding that 22 U.S.C. § 6084 is a statute of repose rather than a statute of limitations, and thus is not subject to equitable tolling.

  2. Plaintiffs contended that, even if § 6084 is a statute of repose, the time bar should have been tolled legislatively due to the presidential suspensions of the private right of action under 22 U.S.C. § 6085(c) from 1996 to 2019.

  3. Plaintiffs argued that their complaints alleged timely conduct by the defendants within the two-year period prior to filing, and that the district courts erred in finding these allegations insufficient to state a claim under the Helms-Burton Act.

  4. Plaintiffs asserted that the district courts erred in dismissing their claims for failure to plausibly allege ''trafficking'' as defined by the Helms-Burton Act.

  5. Plaintiffs objected to the district courts'' procedural rulings, including dismissals with prejudice and findings regarding personal jurisdiction, to the extent those rulings affected their ability to proceed with their claims.'
