outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Adrian Jules''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Jules argued that the district court, not the arbitrator, was the proper authority to decide whether Chateau materially breached the arbitration agreement by allegedly failing to timely pay an arbitration fee.

  2. Jules challenged the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award under Badgerow v. Walters, contending that the application did not itself reveal a basis for diversity or subject matter jurisdiction.

  3. Jules protested the district court’s allowing Appellees (who were not parties to the arbitration agreement) to move to confirm the award, and its allowing Chateau (who was not a party to the lawsuit) to join in the motion to confirm the award.


  === Thomas A. Farinella''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. Farinella joined Jules in arguing that the district court, not the arbitrator, should have decided whether Chateau materially breached the arbitration agreement by failing to timely pay an arbitration fee.

  2. Farinella joined Jules in challenging the district court’s subject matter jurisdiction to confirm the arbitration award under Badgerow v. Walters.

  3. Farinella joined Jules in protesting the district court’s allowing Appellees to move to confirm the award and allowing Chateau to join in the motion despite not being a party to the lawsuit.'
