                    MEMORANDUM AND ORDER                                

I.   INTRODUCTION                                                       
   “The Constitution’s Double Jeopardy Clause2 is an                    
analytically gnarly beast.  What seems like a fairly                      

   1  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.         
   2  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution             
provides:                                                                 
   No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or                  
   otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or                 
   indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the           
   land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual              
   service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any               
   person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in            
   jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any              
   criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be                
   deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process          
straightforward prohibition on multiple prosecutions for the              
same crime turns out to be a bramble bush of doctrinal twists             
and snarls.  At the center is the so-called dual sovereignty              
doctrine.”  Anthony J. Colangelo, Gamble, Dual Sovereignty, and           
Due Process, 2019 Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. 189, 189.  Under our system          

of government, the federal government and the States are                  
separate sovereigns and as such can charge, convict, and                  
sentence the same individual for the same crime.  What about the          
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico?  Somewhat late in the game, “[t]he           
Supreme Court has only once directly addressed whether Puerto             
Rico is a separate sovereign from the federal government, in a            
criminal case.”  Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, Inc. v.              
Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for Puerto Rico, 35 F.4th 1, 14 (1st           
Cir. 2022).  In 2016, the Supreme Court held in Puerto Rico v.            
Sánchez Valle that the United States of America and the                   
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are not –- and never have been --             
separate sovereigns for purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause.            


   of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use,          
   without just compensation.                                           
U.S. Const. amend. V (emphasis added).  “The Double Jeopardy              
Clause [(emphasized above)] ‘protects against a second                    
prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.  It protects            
against a second prosecution for the same offense after                   
conviction.  And it protects against multiple punishments for             
the same offense.’”  United States v. Almonte-Núñez, 963 F.3d             
58, 68 (1st Cir. 2020) (quoting Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165          
(1977)), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 1245 (2021).                            
579 U.S. 59, 78 (2016).  The Supreme Court reasoned that, “while          
each State is a separate sovereign from the federal government            
for purposes of the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause,             
Puerto Rico is not because the historical source of Puerto                
Rico’s prosecutorial power was derived from the federal                   

government.”  Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, Inc., 35 F.4th          
at 14 (citing Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. at 68-69, 75).                      
   The case before the Court illustrates the profound                   
difference this distinction makes.  Petitioner David Núñez Pérez          
(“Núñez Pérez”) claims that he has suffered Double Jeopardy,              
having been convicted and sentenced by the United States for the          
same crime for which he was later convicted and sentenced by the          
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  See Pet. 6, ECF No. 3; Pet., Ex.            
1, Pet. Pursuant 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (“Section 2254 Petition”) 5,            
ECF No. 3-1.  In fact, the parties agree that if these criminal           
actions were prosecuted today, at least the Puerto Rico                   
convictions and sentences for carjacking and manslaughter –-              

totaling forty-six years and six months’ additional prison time           
-– constitutionally would be barred by the Double Jeopardy                
Clause.  See Joint Mot. Compl. Court Order (“Joint Mot.”) 4, 10,          
ECF No. 49.3                                                              


   3 The Commonwealth indicates forty-seven years and six               
months’ is at issue, see Joint Mot. 10, but this appears to be a          
typographical error.                                                      
   The Respondents, Erik Rolon Suarez, Hector Hernandez-                
Morales, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (collectively “the           
Commonwealth”) argue, however, that Núñez Pérez’s petition is             
time-barred under the statute of limitations set by the                   
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”)           

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1)(C).  See Mot. Dismiss Habeas             
Corpus Pet. (“Mot. Dismiss”) 3-5, ECF No. 17.  The Petitioner             
and Respondents disagree about the retroactivity of Sánchez               
Valle, but agree that even if, arguendo, the Supreme Court’s              
decision in Sánchez Valle (1) established a “right” that was              
“newly recognized by the Supreme Court” and (2) “made                     
retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,” the              
petition is untimely by eleven days and must be dismissed                 
without reaching the merits unless equitable tolling applies.             
   For the reasons stated below, the Commonwealth’s motion to           
dismiss the petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.          
§ 2254, ECF No. 17, is hereby DENIED.  Sánchez Valle is                   

retroactive, and equity demands that the eleven-day defalcation           
on the AEDPA’s statute of limitations be excused.  Furthermore,           
because the parties do not dispute that the federal charge and            
certain later Puerto Rico charges are identical, the                      
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico’s prosecution, conviction, and                
sentencing of Núñez Pérez violates the Double Jeopardy Clause             
with respect to the charge, conviction, and resultant sentence            
for carjacking and manslaughter, with the effect of reducing              
Núñez Pérez’s sixty-nine-year sentence by forty-six years and             
six months.4                                                              
II.  BACKGROUND                                                         
   A.   Facts Concerning Underlying Federal And Puerto Rico             
        Convictions                                                     
          1. Núñez Pérez Convicted in Federal Court for                 
            Carjacking with Resultant Death and Sentenced to            
            Ten Years’ Custody.                                         
   The facts of the crime are as senseless as they are                  
heartbreaking.  On June 26, 2001, Núñez Pérez with two others             
participated in a carjacking of a customer at a fast-food                 
restaurant, netting $90.00.  See Third Mot. Submitting Certified          
Trans., Ex. C, Offic. Trans. J. P.R. Cir., Puerto Rico v. Núñez           
Pérez, KLAN0400170 (“P.R. Cir. J.”) 2, ECF No. 47-3.  Núñez               
Pérez was a passenger in that stolen car.  Id. 2-3.  After being          
pursued by police, the driver struck and killed Puerto Rico               
Police Officer William Camacho who was on foot and attempting to          
protect the public by stopping or diverting traffic.5  Id. 3.             

   4 Even with the reduction of sentence here, Núñez Pérez              
still has substantial time to serve on other weapons convictions          
relating to the same incident.  See infra at II.A.2.                      

   5  The First Circuit, in the context of affirming the                
conviction against the driver of the vehicle, Carlos Martinez–            
Bermudez (“Martinez”), recounts Officer Camacho-Rivera’s tragic           
death as he was fulfilling his duty as a police officer:                  

   Officer Camacho–Rivera exited the patrol car and began               
   to stop oncoming traffic.  Martinez drove the stolen                 
   On July 24, 2001, Núñez Pérez was indicted, with two                 
others, on three counts in the United States District Court for           
the District of Puerto Rico (the “Federal Criminal Action”) for:          
   Count One -- Violation of 18 USC § 2119(3) and §2:                   
   taking a motor vehicle by force or violence, with the                
   intent to cause death or serious bodily harm and                     
   resulting in death (“Federal Carjacking Count”)                      

   Count Two -- Violation of 18 USC § 924(c)(l)(A)(ii):                 
   possessing, brandishing or carrying firearms in                      
   relation or furtherance of a carjacking.                             

   Count Three -- Violations of 18 USC § 922(g)(l) and 18               
   USC § 924 (a)(2): possessing a firearm having been                   
   convicted in court of a crime being punishable by                    
   imprisonment of a term exceeding one year.                           


   vehicle approximately sixty miles per hour down the                  
   wrong side of Comercio Street -- that is, against the                
   flow of traffic -- and toward Officer Camacho–Rivera.                
   Although Martinez had sufficient time to stop or                     
   change the direction of his vehicle, he did not do so.               
   Instead, he struck and killed Officer Camacho–Rivera,                
   then lost control of the car and struck two civilian                 
   vehicles before the stolen car finally came to a stop.               

United States v. Martinez-Bermudez, 387 F.3d 98, 99 (1st Cir.             
2004).  As to his federal prosecution, Martinez was sentenced to          
life in federal prison after pleading guilty to carjacking                
resulting in death pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3).  See id.              
With respect to his Puerto Rico prosecution,  Martinez                    
apparently pleaded guilty.  See P.R. Cir. J. 4.  There is a               
discrepancy between the official translation in the Puerto Rico           
Appeals Court case and the First Circuit’s recitation as to who           
was the driver as between Martinez and another individual.                
Compare Martinez-Bermudez, 387 F.3d at 99 (“Martinez drove the            
stolen vehicle . . . .”) with P.R. Cir. J. 3 (“Rivera Heredia             
maneuvered the Elantra . . . .”).  This discrepancy is                    
immaterial because it is undisputed that the driver was not               
Núñez Pérez.                                                              
Judgment, United States v. Núñez-Pérez et al., Criminal No. 01-           
0519 (D.P.R. Sept. 18, 2002), ECF No. 71.  On May 2, 2002, Núñez          
Pérez pled guilty to aiding and abetting the Federal Carjacking           
Count, and was later sentenced to 120 months’ -– ten years -–             
incarceration for his participation in the carjacking.  See id.           

The remaining two firearms charges were dismissed.  Id.                   
          2. Núñez Pérez Subsequently Convicted in Puerto Rico          
            Court on Charges Relating to Same Incident and              
            Sentenced to Sixty-Nine Years to Run Consecutively          
            to Federal Sentence.                                        
   In February 2002, while the Federal Criminal Action was              
pending, Núñez Pérez was indicted by the Commonwealth of Puerto           
Rico in the Mayagüez Superior Court (the “Puerto Rico Criminal            
Action”) for Carjacking (Case IDP2002G0408), First Degree Murder          
(IVI2002G0029) (collectively “the Puerto Rico Carjacking and              
Manslaughter6 Counts”), and two other weapons’ possession charges         
relating to the same incident (collectively “the Puerto Rico              
Weapons’ Possession Charges”).  See Third Mot. Submitting

Instance, Puerto Rico v. Núñez Pérez, Criminal No. PD2002G0320            
3-10, ECF No. 47-2.  Núñez Pérez was found guilty by a jury on            
all of the charges, except the murder charge for which he was             
found guilty of manslaughter.  See id.                                    

   6 Núñez Pérez was convicted of the lesser included offense           
of manslaughter.                                                          
   Núñez Pérez received a sixty-nine-year Puerto Rico prison            
sentence to run consecutively to his ten-year federal sentence            
as follows: forty-five years’ custody for carjacking, one year            
and six months’ custody for manslaughter, and twenty-two years            
and six months’ custody on the weapons’ possession charges.  See          

id. 3-10.                                                                 
   The Respondents stipulate that the Federal Carjacking Count          
on the one hand, and the Puerto Rico Carjacking and Manslaughter          
Counts on the other, are identical crimes for purposes of Double          
Jeopardy analysis.  See Joint Mot. 10.

          1. Núñez Pérez’s Conviction Affirmed and Double               
            Jeopardy Claim Rejected on Direct Appeal.                   
   Núñez Pérez appealed his Puerto Rico convictions arguing             
among other things that Double Jeopardy applied.  On August 31,           
2006, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals rejected that argument,            
and the convictions were affirmed.  P.R. Cir. J. 24-25.  That             
court held that “[t]he doctrine of dual sovereignty applies to            
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Therefore, conduct that                 
constitutes a crime in both jurisdictions may be punished                 
independently by both entities, without violating the                     
constitutional clause against double jeopardy or constituting             
multiple punishments for the same conduct.”  Id. (citation                
omitted).  Núñez Pérez’s request for certiorari to the Supreme            
Court of Puerto Rico was denied on February 2, 2007, for lack of

          2. Núñez Pérez’s Rule 192.1 Motion based upon Supreme         
            Court Decision Sánchez Valle was Denied.                    
   On June 9, 2016 -- ten years after Núñez Pérez’s conviction          
became final -- the Supreme Court issued its decision in Puerto           
Rico v. Sánchez Valle.                                                    
   On June 20, 2017 -- one year and eleven days after that              
decision -- Núñez Pérez, with the assistance of the Legal Aid             
Society, filed a motion pursuant to Rule 192.1 of the Puerto              

Rico Rules of Criminal Procedure, arguing that Double Jeopardy            
applied to his Puerto Rico convictions under Sánchez Valle.  See

   Núñez Pérez applied for certiorari to the Puerto Rico Court          
of Appeals, which denied the writ on December 18, 2018.  See

Ct. Res.”) 1, 7, ECF No. 47-4.  In denying the writ of                    
certiorari, the Court of Appeals rejected the retroactive                 
application of Sánchez Valle to Núñez Pérez’s case because his            
conviction was final before Sánchez Valle was decided:                    
        [A]s to the retroactive application of the rule                 
   announced in Pueblo v. Sánchez Valle, we find that the               
   legal controversy was duly settled in Pueblo v. Torres               
   Irizarry. In the latter case, the Puerto Rico Supreme                
   Court set forth a precedent that the lower courts must               
   observe and apply. The Supreme Court held that Pueblo                
   v. Sánchez Valle established a constitutional defense                
   in favor of the accused and that the caselaw rule                    
   applies retroactively, provided the judgment in that                 
   case is not yet final.  Pueblo v. Torres Irizarry, 199               
   DPR, at 30 [99 PR Offic. Trans. 3, at 13].  In so                    
   ruling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court examined the                   
   controversy based on its pronouncements in Pueblo v.                 
   González Cardona, 153 DPR 765, 774 [53 PR Offic.                     
   Trans. 51, 7] (2001), which, in turn, considered the                 
   rule set forth in Teague v. Lane, 489 US 288 (1989),                 
   the case cited by petitioner.  See: Pueblo v. Torres                 
   Irizarry, 199 DPR, at 27 [99 PR Offic. Trans. 3, at                  
   12]; Pueblo y. González Cardona, 153 DPR, at 772 [53                 
   PR Offic. Trans. 51, at 6] n. 2].                                    

        Seeing that there is no controversy as to the                   
   fact that a final and unappealable judgment has been                 
   entered against Núñez Pérez when Pueblo v. Sánchez                   
   Valle was decided, we find no compelling reason to                   
   disturb the appealed Resolution. In addition, we find                
   no indication of passion, prejudice, bias, or manifest               
   error in the decision rendered by the [Court of First                
   Instance].                                                           

        For the foregoing reasons, we deny the writ of                  
   certiorari in accordance with the criteria provided                  
   under Court of Appeals Rule 40.                                      

Id. 7.  Núñez Pérez applied for certiorari to the Supreme Court           
of Puerto Rico, which was denied on February 15, 2019, along

   7  Other than the representation in the Answer, the Court is         
without any record of the dates surrounding the applications and          
denials of certiorari and the motions for reconsideration with            
the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.  The Court has requested a              
complete record as to the decisions of the Puerto Rico Courts.            
To the extent the Commonwealth has failed to provide more                 
complete information, the issue is waived.                                
   On November 4, 2021, the Court held a hearing on the motion

   On November 18, 2021, the Court ordered the Respondents to

an evidentiary hearing is necessary pursuant to Rules 7 and 8 of          
the Rules Governing section 2254 Cases in the United States               
District Courts.  The matter is ripe for decision.                        
III.  ANALYSIS                                                          
   A. The Petition is Timely                                            

   Pursuant to section 2244, “[a] 1-year period of limitation           
shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a            
person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.”             
26 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1).  This limitations period runs “from the           
latest of . . . the date on which the constitutional right                
asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the            
right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made             
retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.”  Id.             
   Here, Sánchez Valle was decided June 9, 2016.  Núñez Pérez           
filed a Rule 192.1 Motion under Puerto Rico Rules of Criminal             
Procedure on June 20, 2017 –- eleven days past the one-year               
anniversary.9  Thus, presuming Sánchez Valle sets the date at             


   9 Had Núñez Pérez filed the Rule 192.1 motion within one             
year, the petition would have been timely because the statute of          
limitations would have been tolled.  “[M]otions under Rule 192.1          
are a form of collateral attack. . . .  As such, pursuant to [28          
U.S.C.] § 2244(d)(2), the time in which this [type of] motion is          
pending ‘shall not be counted toward any period of limitation             
under this subsection.’”  Pérez-Pagán v. Mercado-Quiñones, 179            
F. Supp. 3d 174, 177 (D.P.R. 2016) (Domínguez, J.) (quoting 28            
U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2)).  “The First Circuit Court of Appeals has            
held that ‘Section 2244(d)(2) does not reset the clock on the             
limitations period.’  Trapp v. Spencer, 479 F. 3d 53, 58 (1st             
Cir. 2007).  [A federal habeas petitioner] cannot extend the              
which the statute of limitations begins to run, the petition is           
untimely absent equitable reasons to excuse untimely filing.              
   Núñez Pérez admits that absent equitable tolling, the                
petition is time-barred.  See Joint Mot. 3 (“[T]he Petitioner             
(for sake of professional honesty) must concede that the                  

petition was untimely.”).  He “requests for the application of            
equitable tolling, and for the dismissal of the affirmative               
defense of the one-year statute of limitation under the 28 U.S.C          
[§] 2244(d)(1)(C)” or in “the alternative, . . . for this Court           
to schedule an argumentative hearing to further discuss this              
matter.”  Id. 4.                                                          
   “[E]quitable tolling is strong medicine, not profligately            
to be dispensed.”  Delaney v. Matesanz, 264 F.3d 7, 15 (1st Cir.          
2001).  Typically, “[t]o establish a basis for equitable                  
tolling, a habeas petitioner must demonstrate that he or she has          
diligently pursued her rights, but some extraordinary                     
circumstance, or obstacle, prevented timely filing.”  Blue v.             

Medeiros, 913 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2019) (citing Holland v.                
Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010)).  Under this approach, “[t]he          
diligence prong covers those affairs within the petitioner’s              
control, while the extraordinary-circumstances prong covers               

AEDPA statute of limitations by filing a Rule 192.1 motion.”              
Diaz-Castro v. Matta 568 F. Supp. 3d 144, 150 (D.P.R. 2021)               
(Besosa, J.).  Since the parties did not argue a different                
period, the eleven days’ defalcation controls here.                       
matters outside his control.”  Id.  The burden is on “the                 
petitioner to establish ‘a causal relationship between the                
extraordinary circumstances on which the claim for equitable              
tolling rests and the lateness of his filing.’”  Id.  To be               
sure, the First Circuit admonishes that the “AEDPA’s statute of           

limitations will not be equitably tolled merely because the               
underlying grounds for habeas relief are extraordinary; rather,           
the ‘extraordinary circumstance’ must be one that actually                
caused the untimely filing.”  Holmes v. Spencer, 685 F.3d 51, 62          
(1st Cir. 2012) (citing Holland, 560 U.S. at 648).                        
   Even so, the First Circuit, in the context of this test,             
teaches that the Court must always “apply equitable tolling on a          
case-by-case basis, avoiding mechanical rules and favoring                
flexibility.”  Holmes, 685 F.3d at 62 (quotations omitted).               
Indeed, the Supreme Court in Holland recognized that equity is            
not a one-size-fits-all proposition even in the context of the            
two-prong test:                                                           

        We have said that courts of equity “must be                     
   governed by rules and precedents no less than the                    
   courts of law.”  Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 323,               
   116 S.Ct. 1293, 134 L.Ed.2d 440 (1996) (internal                     
   quotation marks omitted).  But we have also made clear               
   that often the “exercise of a court’s equity powers                  
   ... must be made on a case-by-case basis.”  Baggett v.               
   Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 375, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d                
   377 (1964).  In emphasizing the need for                             
   “flexibility,” for avoiding “mechanical rules,”                      
   Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396, 66 S.Ct.                   
   582, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946), we have followed a tradition               
   in which courts of equity have sought to “relieve                    
   hardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard                
   and fast adherence” to more absolute legal rules,                    
   which, if strictly applied, threaten the “evils of                   
   archaic rigidity,” Hazel–Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford–                
   Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 248, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed.                
   1250 (1944).  The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable               
   procedure” enables courts “to meet new situations                    
   [that] demand equitable intervention, and to accord                  
   all the relief necessary to correct ... particular                   
   injustices.”  Ibid.  (permitting postdeadline filing                 
   of bill of review).  Taken together, these cases                     
   recognize that courts of equity can and do draw upon                 
   decisions made in other similar cases for guidance.                  
   Such courts exercise judgment in light of prior                      
   precedent, but with awareness of the fact that                       
   specific circumstances, often hard to predict in                     
   advance, could warrant special treatment in an                       
   appropriate case.                                                    

Holland, 560 U.S. at 649-650 (emphasis added).  Applying Holland          
here, the Court determines that equity demands the tolling of             
the statute of limitations.                                               
   Núñez Pérez asserts in his petition under the pains and              
penalties of perjury that “when [he] found out about the . . .            
Sánchez Valle case [he] filed a motion under Rule 192.1.”  Pet.           
12.  According to the record, Núñez Pérez was represented by the          
Legal Aid Society when he filed his Rule 192.1 Petition eleven            
days after the federal deadline expired.  On this evidence and            
the procedural history, Núñez Pérez has satisfied the diligence           
prong.                                                                    
   The second prong, extraordinary circumstances, is also               
satisfied –- albeit barely –- by the unique circumstances in              
this case that warrants flexibility.  While counsel’s garden              
variety errors are not extraordinary circumstances by                     
themselves, see Trapp v. Spencer, 479 F.3d 53, 60 (1st Cir.               
2007) (“This circuit, along with many others, has held that               
‘mistake by counsel in reading [AEDPA] or computing the time              
limit is, at most, a routine error’ and does not constitute               

extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling.”                
(quotations omitted)), counsel’s oversight here was more                  
significant than a routine error and appears to be the result of          
a complex set of legal and factual circumstances.                         
   As an initial matter, it is apparent that Núñez Pérez’s              
counsel may have been entirely unaware of the AEDPA deadline              
running while preparing a Puerto Rico Court Rule 192.1 motion             
that had no deadline at all.  See P.R. Laws tit. 34A, § II, R.            
192.1 (“The motion . . . may be filed at any time.”)  To be               
sure, this element is not sufficient by itself.  Additionally,            
though, the relevant issue in this case –- retroactivity of a             
unique Double Jeopardy argument -- is extraordinarily complex,            

and in the context of the interplay between AEDPA’s non-                  
jurisdictional statute of limitations and a prisoner’s                    
exhaustion of state remedies, is rendered more difficult to               
understand, even for skilled practitioners.                               
   In the absence of a more detailed record, this is an                 
“appropriate case” presenting “specific circumstances, often              
hard to predict in advance, . . . warrant[ing] special                    
treatment,” Holland, 560 U.S. at 650: the rigid application of            
AEDPA’s statute of limitations here would be inequitable.                 
Indeed, if equitable tolling is to have any meaning at all, it            
must be applied in this case.  Here, a prisoner through counsel           
filed a timely post-conviction motion under Puerto Rico law to            

the appropriate Puerto Rico court that was a mere eleven days             
late under the AEDPA.  Under ordinary circumstances, the                  
petition was dead on arrival when Núñez Pérez, after the end of           
that process, and at that point pro se, swiftly filed his habeas          
petition in this Court.  Taking a “case-by-case” approach,                
equity in this case is a concept of the sum being more than its           
parts.  Viewing the case as a whole, rather than individual               
elements myopically, the procedural posture combined with novel           
issues of law were obstacles to filing that, in light of the              
stakes at issue here –- an additional forty-six years and six             
months imprisonment, in practical terms a life sentence –- is so          
disproportionate that equity would seem to mandate tolling -–             

that’s the way it looks to me.  See Cruz-Berrios v. Borrero, CV           
14-1232 (ADC), 2020 WL 5820955, at *6 (D.P.R. Sept. 30, 2020)             
(Delgado-Colón, J.) (denying Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) relief on              
successful section 2254 habeas action, describing procedural              
confusion as an extraordinary circumstance of petition filed              
purportedly 1,113 days late, and stating: “In this Court's view,          
1,113 days are nothing compared to the long years of                      
imprisonment served by the now-64 years old petitioner under a            
[life] sentence successfully challenged under 2254.  Moreover,            
without a doubt there are extraordinary circumstances that stood          
in the way of a timely habeas petition.”).                                
   B. The Supreme Court’s Decision in Sánchez Valle that the            
     United States and Puerto Rico are a Single Sovereign for           
     Purposes of Double Jeopardy is a New Substantive Rule              
     that Applies Retroactively.                                        

          1. The Habeas Corpus Standard                                 
   Federal habeas corpus relief with respect to a Puerto Rico           
judgment is exceptional.  “Under the ‘peculiarly deferential              
standards’ of the [AEDPA], error by a [Puerto Rico] court,                
without more, is not enough to warrant federal habeas relief.’”           
Gomes v. Silva, 958 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2020) (quoting Bebo v.          
Medeiros, 906 F.3d 129, 134 (1st Cir. 2018).  “As relevant here,          
a [Puerto Rico] court decision may only be overturned on habeas           
review if it is ‘contrary to, or involved an unreasonable                 
application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined            
by the Supreme Court of the United States.’”  Bebo, 906 F.3d at           
134 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)).                                     
   The First Circuit describes what is required to meet this            
rigorous standard as follows:                                             
   It is well established that “[a] state court decision                
   is ‘contrary to’ clearly established federal law ‘if                 
   the state court applies a rule that contradicts the                  
   governing law set forth by the Supreme Court or                      
   confronts a set of facts that are materially                         
   indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme                    
   Court] and nevertheless arrives at a result different                
   from [its] precedent.’”  Linton v. Saba, 812 F.3d 112,               
   122 (1st Cir. 2016) (quoting Hensley v. Roden, 755                   
   F.3d 724, 731 (1st Cir. 2014)).  On the other hand, “a               
   state court adjudication constitutes an unreasonable                 
   application [of clearly established federal law] if                  
   the state court identifies the correct governing legal               
   principle from the Supreme Court’s then-current                      
   decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to                 
   the facts of the . . . case.”  Id. (quoting Hensley,                 
   755 F.3d at 731).                                                    

Hollis v. Magnusson, 32 F.4th 1, 7–8 (1st Cir. 2022).  Here, the          
petition seeks relief under contrary-to and unreasonableness              
provisions.                                                               
          2. The United States and Puerto Rico are a Single             
            Sovereign for Purposes of Double Jeopardy                   
   One of the most familiar precepts of Constitutional law is           
the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the                  
Constitution which, among other things, “prohibits more than one          
prosecution for the ‘same offence’” by the same sovereign.                
Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. at 62; see Abney v. United States, 431            
U.S. 651, 660–61 (1977).  Justice Gorsuch recently described the          
deep-seated roots of this principle enshrined in our                      
Constitution:                                                             
   Fear and abhorrence of governmental power to try                     
   people twice for the same conduct is one of the oldest               
   ideas found in western civilization.  Throughout                     
   history, people have worried about the vast disparity                
   of power between governments and individuals, the                    
   capacity of the state to bring charges repeatedly                    
   until it wins the result it wants, and what little                   
   would be left of human liberty if that power remained                
   unchecked.  To address the problem, the law in ancient               
   Athens held that a man could not be tried twice for                  
   the same offense.  The Roman Republic and Empire                     
   incorporated a form of double jeopardy protection in                 
   their laws.  The Old Testament and later church                      
   teachings endorsed the bar against double jeopardy                   
   too.  And from the earliest days of the common law,                  
   courts recognized that to punish a man twice over for                
   one offence would be deeply unjust.                                  
Gamble v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 1960, 1996 (2019) (Gorsuch,           
J., dissenting) (citations and quotations omitted).                       
   As between the United States and the States of the Union,            
there is an exception to the protection of the Double Jeopardy            
Clause permitting both the federal government and the States to           
prosecute a person separately for the same offense: the dual              
sovereignty doctrine.  Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, “a            
single act gives rise to distinct offenses -- and thus may                
subject a person to successive prosecutions -- if it violates             
the laws of separate sovereigns.”  Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. at             
62.  The dual sovereignty doctrine between the federal                    
government and the States, criticized in Gamble by the late-              
Justice Ginsburg as a “metaphysical subtlety” and Justice                 
Gorsuch as a “colossal exception to this ancient rule against             
double jeopardy,”10 is at least for now settled law, permitting           

   10 See Gamble, 139 S. Ct. at 1989 (Ginsberg, J., dissenting)         
(“I dissent from the Court’s adherence to that misguided                  
doctrine.  Instead of frittering away Gamble’s liberty upon a             
metaphysical subtlety, two sovereignties, I would hold that the           
Double Jeopardy Clause bars successive prosecutions for the same          
offense by parts of the whole USA.”) (citations and quotations            
omitted) (citing Sánchez Valle, 136 S. Ct. at 1877; Grant, The            
prosecutions for identical offenses under both federal and State          
law because they are separate sovereigns.  See Gamble, 139 S.             
Ct. at 1964 (“Under this “dual-sovereignty” doctrine, a State             
may prosecute a defendant under state law even if the Federal             
Government has prosecuted him for the same conduct under a                

federal statute.”).  Said another way, “two prosecutions . . .            
are not for the same offense if brought by different sovereigns           
-- even when those actions target the identical criminal conduct          
through equivalent criminal laws.”  Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. at            
66-67.                                                                    
   While Puerto Rico shares many similarities with the States           
of the Union, it maintains “a distinctive, indeed exceptional,            
status as a self-governing Commonwealth,” id. at 73, and “boasts          
a relationship to the United States that has no parallel in our           


Lanza Rule of Successive Prosecutions, 32 Colum. L. Rev. 1309,            
1331 (1932)); id. at 1996 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (“A free              
society does not allow its government to try the same individual          
for the same crime until it’s happy with the result.                      
Unfortunately, the Court today endorses a colossal exception to           
this ancient rule against double jeopardy.  My colleagues say             
that the federal government and each State are “separate                  
sovereigns” entitled to try the same person for the same crime.           
So if all the might of one ‘sovereign’ cannot succeed against             
the presumptively free individual, another may insist on the              
chance to try again.  And if both manage to succeed, so much the          
better; they can add one punishment on top of the other.  But             
this ‘separate sovereigns exception’ to the bar against double            
jeopardy finds no meaningful support in the text of the                   
Constitution, its original public meaning, structure, or                  
history.  Instead, the Constitution promises all Americans that           
they will never suffer double jeopardy.  I would enforce that             
guarantee.”).                                                             
history,” id. at 77 (quotations omitted).  Prior to the Supreme           
Court’s 2016 decision in Sánchez Valle, “it was established in            
this circuit that the United States and the Commonwealth of               
Puerto Rico were separate sovereigns.”  United States v.                  
Almonte-Nunez, 963 F.3d 58, 69 (2020) (citing United States v.            
López Andino, 831 F.2d 1164, 1168 (1st Cir. 1987)).11  Since              

Sánchez Valle, however, “the Supreme Court has now held that              
‘for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, . . . the                    
Commonwealth and the United States are not separate                       
sovereigns.’”  Almonte-Nunez, 963 F.3d at 68 (quoting Sánchez             
Valle, 579 U.S. at 78).  The holding goes straight to the heart           
of the derivative nature of Puerto Rico’s prosecutorial power:            
   Because the ultimate source of Puerto Rico’s                         
   prosecutorial power is the Federal Government --                     
   because when we trace that authority all the way back,               
   we arrive at the doorstep of the U.S. Capitol -- the                 
   Commonwealth and the United States are not separate                  
   sovereigns.  That means the two governments cannot                   
   “twice put” respondents Sánchez Valle and Gómez                      
   Vázquez “in jeopardy” for the “same offence.” U.S.                   
   Const., Amdt. 5.                                                     


   11 The Eleventh Circuit in 1993 disagreed with the First             
Circuit’s belief that Puerto Rico is a separate sovereign.  See           
United States v. Sanchez, 992 F.2d 1143, 1151–52 (11th Cir.               
1993) (“As a territory, Puerto Rico remains outside an exception          
to the Double Jeopardy Clause which is based upon dual                    
sovereignty.”).  In Sanchez, the Eleventh Circuit reversed a              
murder for hire conviction in federal court because it was                
duplicative of an attempted murder charge under Puerto Rico law.          
Id. at 1159.                                                              
Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. at 78.  As the First Circuit recently             
observed in the context of law-of-the-case doctrine, “Sánchez             
Valle represents a dramatic intervening change in controlling             
legal authority.”12  Almonte-Nunez, 963 F.3d at 69 (quotations            
omitted).                                                                 
          3. The Supreme Court’s Decision in Sánchez Valle is a         
            New Rule.                                                   
   Did the Supreme Court announce a new rule in Sánchez Valle?          
No doubt, and the parties do not dispute this point, but rather           
its retroactivity.  See generally Resp’ts’ Suppl. Mem.  “It is            
admittedly often difficult to determine when a case announces a           
new rule,” and the Supreme Court has been careful “not [to]               

attempt to define the spectrum of what may or may not constitute          
a new rule for retroactivity purposes.”  Teague v. Lane, 489              

   12 The late Judge Casellas observed the distinction between          
Puerto Rico and the States in relation to the dual sovereign              
doctrine:                                                                 

   At its core, Sánchez Valle was a criminal case where                 
   the Supreme Court narrowly addressed a fundamental                   
   injustice in the American legal system -- the dual                   
   sovereignty doctrine that permits two jurisdictions                  
   within the same nation to prosecute a defendant for                  
   the same offense.  The Court is not aware of any other               
   civilized country that allows this.  In Sánchez Valle,               
   the Supreme Court was able to remedy this seemingly                  
   unfair situation but only as to Puerto Rico, given the               
   Commonwealth’s unique constitutional relationship with               
   the United States.

4119620, at *4 n.4 (D.P.R. Sept. 15, 2017) (Casellas, J.).                
U.S. 288, 301 (1989).  Nevertheless, as here, “a case announces           
a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation          
on the States or the Federal Government . . . To put it                   
differently, a case announces a new rule if the result was not            
dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant’s                

conviction became final.”  Id. (emphasis omitted).                        
          4. The Supreme Court’s Decision in Sánchez Valle is           
            Retroactive.                                                
   This Court rules that Sánchez Valle applies retroactively.13         
Until last May, the Supreme Court held that unless a new rule             

   13 The Court observes that this not the first time the issue         
of retroactivity of Sánchez–Valle has worked its way up to the            
First Circuit.  In Santana-Rios v. United States, 235 F. Supp.            
3d 386, 387-88 (D.P.R. 2017) (Gelpí, J.), the court ruled that            
it lacked authority to decide the issue of retroactivity of               
Sánchez Valle under Section 2255.   The Santana-Rios court                
authorized a certificate of appealability on the “novel issue             
regarding the retroactivity of the Sánchez–Valle ruling.”  See            
id. at 388.  On appeal, the First Circuit issued an unpublished           
judgment disagreeing that the district court lacked authority to          
decide the retroactivity issue:                                           

        [The district court’s] assessment appears to be                 
   contrary to this court’s statement in Butterworth v.                 
   United States “that district and appellate courts, no                
   less than the Supreme Court, may issue opinions on                   
   initial petitions for collateral review holding in the               
   first instance that a new rule is retroactive in the                 
   absence of a specific finding to that effect by the                  
   Supreme Court.”  775 F.3d 459, 464 (1st Cir. 2015)                   
   (emphasis added; internal quotation marks and brackets               
   omitted).  The underlying motion was [Petitioner’s]                  
   “initial petition[] for collateral review.”  Id.                     

Judgment at 1, Santana-Rios v. United States, Appeal No. 17-1199          
(1st Cir. April 1, 2019) (emphasis omitted).  The First Circuit           
falls within two exceptions it does not apply retroactively.              
“First, a new rule should be applied retroactively if it places           
certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the           


did not decide the issue of retroactivity, but rather affirmed            
on an alternative ground that a privity requirement between               
federal and state prosecutors had not been developed.  Id. at 2.          

   Subsequently, district courts have cited Santana-Rios for            
the proposition that Sánchez–Valle is not retroactive on appeal.          
See e.g. Valdez-Aponte v. United States, CV 16-2922(RAM), 2021            
WL 1565299, at *2 (D.P.R. Apr. 21, 2021) (citing Santana-Rios             
and holding in 28 U.S.C. § 2255 petition context without                  
explanation, “the ruling in Sanchez-Valle does not apply                  
retroactively”); Merced-Nieves v. Baltazar, 3:17-CV-1412, 2019            
WL 1531926, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 9, 2019) (citing Santana-Rios            
as indicating that Sánchez Valle is not retroactive); Lopez-              
Rivera v. United States, CR 12-656 (ADC), 2018 WL 5016399, at *2          
(D.P.R. Oct. 16, 2018) (same).  These decisions are of little             
value in light of the First Circuit’s ruling on appeal.                   

   Furthermore, this Court is aware that the issue of                   
retroactive application of Sánchez Valle is the subject of a              
pending motion for a certificate of appealability in Rodriguez-           
Mendez v. United States.  See Motion for Certificate of                   
Appealability, Rodriguez-Mendez v. United States, Appeal No. 20-          
1360 (1st Cir. Sept. 30, 2020).  In Rodriguez-Mendez, the                 
district court denied a federal prisoner’s habeas corpus                  
petition, relying on the First Circuit’s unpublished decision in          
Santana-Rios as indicative of a “privity” requirement in Double           
Jeopardy analysis, and avoided retroactivity analysis.  16-cv-            
2683, 2019 WL 4875301, at *4 (D.P.R. Sept. 30, 2019) (Gelpí, J.)          
(“There is no need for this Court to decide whether Sanchez               
Valle applies retroactively or not; that issue is for another             
day.  Much like the petitioner in Santana-Rios, Rodríguez Méndez          
has failed to meet the stone set privity requirement necessary            
for his double jeopardy claim to thrive.”).  This Court                   
disagrees that there is any “privity” requirement necessary for           
a Double Jeopardy claim, as opposed to a collateral estoppel              
claim.  As guided by the First Circuit in Santana-Rios and                
Butterworth, this Court provides its ruling on this issue in the          
first instance as is its duty.                                            
power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe.                  
Second, a new rule should be applied retroactively if it                  
requires the observance of those procedures that . . . are                
implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”  Teague, 489 U.S.            
at 307 (citations and quotations omitted).  The second exception          

applied, at least theoretically, to “watershed rules of criminal          
procedure.”  Id. at 311.                                                  
   As the Supreme Court has recently decided, however, the              
second, so-called watershed exception, had never been applied by          
the Supreme Court in the three decades since Teague and is                
therefore extinguished by desuetude.  See Edwards v. Vannoy, 141          
S. Ct. 1547, 1556-60 (2021).  Now, only new substantive rules             
are retroactive on collateral review:                                     
   New substantive rules alter “the range of conduct or                 
   the class of persons that the law punishes.”  [Schriro               
   v.] Summerlin, 542 U.S. [348,] 353 [2004].  Those new                
   substantive rules apply to cases pending in trial                    
   courts and on direct review, and they also apply                     
   retroactively on federal collateral review.  New                     
   procedural rules alter “only the manner of determining               
   the defendant’s culpability.”  Ibid. (emphasis                       
   deleted).  Those new procedural rules apply to cases                 
   pending in trial courts and on direct review.  But new               
   procedural rules do not apply retroactively on federal               
   collateral review.                                                   

Id. at 1562.14                                                            

   14  The profound impact of the abandonment of the watershed          
exception was observed by Justice Kagan (joined by Justice                
Breyer and Justice Sotomayor) in her dissent:                             
   Sánchez–Valle is a substantive rule that requires full               
retroactive effect because it goes to the heart of the power of           
a single sovereign -- the federal government and the                      
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico -- to bring a successive prosecution          
of Núñez Pérez for identical crimes.                                      

   The Commonwealth argues that in Sánchez Valle the Supreme            
Court “merely took the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico out of the             
dual sovereignty exception, putting it back under the                     
application of the ‘double jeopardy’ prohibition.”  Resp’ts’              
Suppl. Mem. 4 (emphasis omitted).  This argument minimizes the            
profound constitutional forces at work here.  Admittedly, in              
their dissent, Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall raised the            
concern that post-Teague, “[h]abeas claims under the Double               
Jeopardy Clause will also be barred under the plurality’s                 
approach if the rules they seek to establish would ‘brea[k] new           
ground or impos[e] a new obligation on the States or the Federal          
Government,’ ante, at 301, because they bear no relation to the           

petitioner’s guilt or innocence.”  Teague, 489 U.S. at 336–37             

   Not content to misapply Teague’s watershed provision                 
   here, the majority forecloses any future application.                
   It prevents any procedural rule ever -- no matter how                
   integral to adjudicative fairness -- from benefiting a               
   defendant on habeas review.  Thus does a settled                     
   principle of retroactivity law die, in an effort to                  
   support an insupportable ruling.                                     

Edwards, 141 S. Ct. at 1574 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (citations            
omitted).                                                                 
(Brennan, J., dissenting).  As the Supreme Court later held,              
however, “a new rule placing a certain class of individuals               
beyond the State’s power to punish by death is analogous to a             
new rule placing certain conduct beyond the State’s power to              
punish at all.”  Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 330 (1989)               

(emphasis added), abrogated by Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304           
(2002).  The Supreme Court in Penry also referred to new rules            
as those concerning “substantive categorical guarantees accorded          
by the Constitution, regardless of the procedures followed.”              
Id. at 329.                                                               
   Other courts have held that the protections afforded by the          
Double Jeopardy Clause are one such guarantee.  See McIntyre v.           
Trickey, 938 F.2d 899, 904 (8th Cir. 1991) (“The protection               
afforded by the [D]ouble [J]eopardy clause operates at an                 
elemental level . . . Because it bars an unconstitutional                 
prosecution, a rule concerning double jeopardy is analogous to            
the rule discussed in Penry, which would have barred the                  

imposition of an unconstitutional punishment . . . We therefore           
conclude that a rule concerning double jeopardy . . . falls               
under the first Teague exception and must be accorded full                
retroactive effect.”), judgment vacated on other grounds sub              
nom. Caspari v. McIntyre, 503 U.S. 978 (1992); see also Johnson           
v. Howard, 963 F.2d 342, 345 (11th Cir. 1992) (“[B]ecause its             
very purpose is to prevent the occurrence of unconstitutional             
prosecutions, it follows that the prohibition on double jeopardy          
is a categorical guarantee[] accorded by the Constitution.”)              
(quotations omitted) (citing North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S.           
711, 718 (1969) (describing the Double Jeopardy Clause as a               
“basic constitutional guarantee”)).15                                     

   More recently, in Welch v. United States, Justice Thomas             
expressed generally that under retroactivity analysis, “if the            
Court ruled that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars all federal              
reprosecutions, I doubt that rule would be retroactive.  That             
rule dictates when a defendant may be tried and convicted of              
certain conduct -- not the substance of the crime for which the           
defendant is tried, or the punishment imposed.”  578 U.S. 120,            
144 (2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Nevertheless, the Court             
agrees with the Eighth and Eleventh Circuits’ conclusions that            
rules with respect to the Double Jeopardy Clause are                      
substantive.                                                              



   15 The Eighth Circuit’s assertion that a rule affecting              
Double Jeopardy is a substantive rule has been criticized by the          
Second Circuit.  See United States v. Salerno, 964 F.2d 172, 178          
(2d Cir. 1992) (disagreeing with the Eighth Circuit’s analysis            
in Mcyntire v. Trickey).  On remand in McIntyre, the Eighth               
Circuit rejected the Second Circuit’s disagreement and                    
“adhere[d] to [its] holding that Grady must be accorded                   
retroactive effect because the prohibition on double jeopardy is          
a categorical guarantee accorded by the Constitution.”  975 F.2d          
437, 439 n.2 (8th Cir. 1992), judgment vacated sub nom. Caspari           
v. McIntyre, 510 U.S. 939 (1993).  This Court agrees with the             
Eighth Circuit.                                                           
   Indeed, a case prior to Sánchez Valle in which the Supreme           
Court rejected the dual sovereignty doctrine is Waller v.                 
Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 390-95 (1970).  In that case, the Supreme          
Court held that a state and municipality were not separate                
sovereigns for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause:                    

   These provisions of the Florida Constitution                         
   demonstrate that the judicial power to try petitioner                
   on the first charges in municipal court springs from                 
   the same organic law that created the state court of                 
   general jurisdiction in which petitioner was tried and               
   convicted for a felony.  Accordingly, the apt analogy                
   to the relationship between municipal and state                      
   governments is to be found in the relationship between               
   the government of a Territory and the Government of                  
   the United States.                                                   
Id. at 393.  Although pre-Teague, the Supreme Court later                 
“accorded full retroactive effect” to Waller, holding that                
“[t]he guarantee against double jeopardy is . . . a                       
constitutional right of the criminal defendant . . . [with the]           
practical result . . . to prevent a trial from taking place at            
all, rather than to prescribe procedural rules that govern the            
conduct of a trial.”  Robinson v. Neil, 409 U.S. 505, 509, 511            
(1973).                                                                   
   This is where the rubber hits the road here.  Sánchez–Valle          
fundamentally defined the sovereign relationship between the              
United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, identifying            
the Constitutional limits on each sovereign’s authority to bring          
identical subsequent criminal prosecutions –- indeed, “a                  
substantive categorical guarantee accorded by the Constitution”           
Penry, 492 U.S. at 329, analogous to the “power to punish at              
all,” id. at 304.  The Sánchez–Valle decision informs this Court          
that the federal government’s and the Commonwealth’s authority            
to prosecute identical actions under identical criminal laws is           

a “substantive” rule.  See McIntyre, 938 F.2d at 904.                     
   The Commonwealth argues that “applying Sánchez–Valle                 
retroactively would potentially overturn decades of convictions           
obtained in reliance on the application of the dual sovereignty           
exception to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.”  Resp’ts’ Suppl.           
Mem. 6.  Even accepting the premise of this argument –- which is          
not fully developed in the record -- the Commonwealth’s argument          
fails on a more fundamental level.  It is true, of course, that           
“applying constitutional rules not in existence at the time a             
conviction became final seriously undermines the principle of             
finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal              
justice system.”  Edwards, 141 S. Ct. at 1554 (quotations                 

omitted).  As the Supreme Court recently held, however, finality          
interests generally implicate at least two concerns.                      
   “First, a federal order to . . . release a state prisoner            
overrides the State’s sovereign power to enforce societal norms           
through criminal law.  That is so because habeas relief                   
frequently cost[s] society the right to punish admitted                   
offenders.”  Shinn v. Ramirez, 142 S. Ct. 1718, 1731 (2022)               
(emphasis added; citations and quotations omitted).  The concern          
is that federal interference with the State as a separate                 
sovereign may “inflict a profound injury to the powerful and              
legitimate interest in punishing the guilty, an interest shared           
by the State and the victims of crime alike.”  Id.  That                  

interest is wholly absent here: Núñez Pérez has been punished             
for the crimes of conviction by a single sovereign, and                   
therefore there is no separate, tread-upon sovereign power or             
interest in play.                                                         
   Second, and apparently more to the Commonwealth’s point,             
“federal intervention imposes significant costs on state                  
criminal justice systems.  It disturbs the State’s significant            
interest in repose for concluded litigation, and undermines the           
States’ investment in their criminal trials.”  Id. (citations             
and quotations omitted).  This important interest, however, is            
not outweighed by the interest in an individual’s constitutional          
right to be prosecuted only once for a crime.  The federal                

government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, again, are one-           
and-the same, at least for purposes of Double Jeopardy.16  Here,          

   16 Núñez Pérez’s petition also argues that the doctrine of           
collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, bars the Puerto Rico            
action.  “[W]hether a criminal defendant’s issue preclusion               
rights exist outside of the double jeopardy context is an open            
question in this circuit.”  United States v. Rosado-Cancel, No.           
13-cr-731, 2017 WL 543199, at *3 (D.P.R. Feb. 10, 2017)                   
(Domínguez, J.), aff’d, 917 F.3d 66 (1st Cir. 2019).  Unlike the          
doctrines of claim and issue preclusion in the civil context,             
the federal government and the Commonwealth as single sovereign           
have achieved a federal conviction that is left undisturbed by            
the outcome in this case.                                                 
   When stripped of the dual sovereignty argument, the                  
Commonwealth’s contention boils down to a desire to preserve              

unconstitutional convictions as a result of its dissatisfaction           
with a first conviction or acquittal in federal court.  Justice           
Gorsuch’s dissent in Gamble dispenses with the Commonwealth’s             
reliance argument, albeit in arguing against continued                    
recognition of the dual sovereign doctrine as between the                 
federal government and the States:                                        
        That leaves reliance.  But the only people who                  
   have relied on the separate sovereigns exception are                 
   prosecutors who have sought to double-prosecute and                  
   double-punish.  And this Court has long rejected the                 
   idea that “law enforcement reliance interests                        
   outweig[h] the interest in protecting individual                     
   constitutional rights so as to warrant fidelity to an                
   unjustifiable rule.”  Instead, “[i]f it is clear that                
   a practice is unlawful, individuals’ interest in its                 
   discontinuance clearly outweighs any law enforcement                 
   ‘entitlement’ to its persistence.”  That is the case                 
   here.                                                                

        The Court today disregards these lessons.  It                   
   worries that overturning the separate sovereigns rule                

there is no requirement in the criminal context that bars                 
subsequent timely charges as to matters which could have been,            
but were not, included in the original indictment.  Thus, even            
if claim preclusion applies beyond the reach of the Double                
Jeopardy Clause, the firearms licensing and possession charges            
were not litigated in the original federal criminal action and            
claim preclusion plays no role here.  Accordingly, the Court              
denies the petition as to the Puerto Rico Weapons’ Possession             
convictions.                                                              
   could undermine the reliance interests of prosecutors                
   in transnational cases who might be prohibited from                  
   trying individuals already acquitted by a foreign                    
   court.  Yet even on its own terms, this argument is                  
   unpersuasive.  The government has not even attempted                 
   to quantify the scope of the alleged “problem,” and                  
   perhaps for good reason.  Domestic prosecutors                       
   regularly coordinate with their foreign counterparts                 
   when pursuing transnational criminals, so they can                   
   often choose the most favorable forum for their mutual               
   efforts.  And because Blockburger requires an identity               
   of elements before the double jeopardy bar can take                  
   hold, domestic prosecutors, armed with their own                     
   abundant criminal codes, will often be able to find                  
   new offenses to charge if they are unsatisfied with                  
   outcomes elsewhere.                                                  

        * * *                                                           

        Enforcing the Constitution always bears its                     
   costs.  But when the people adopted the Constitution                 
   and its Bill of Rights, they thought the liberties                   
   promised there worth the costs.  It is not for this                  
   Court to reassess this judgment to make the                          
   prosecutor’s job easier.  Nor is there any doubt that                
   the benefits the framers saw in prohibiting double                   
   prosecutions remain real, and maybe more vital than                  
   ever, today.  When governments may unleash all their                 
   might in multiple prosecutions against an individual,                
   exhausting themselves only when those who hold the                   
   reins of power are content with the result, it is “the               
   poor and the weak,” and the unpopular and                            
   controversial, who suffer first -- and there is                      
   nothing to stop them from being the last.  The                       
   separate sovereigns exception was wrong when it was                  
   invented, and it remains wrong today.                                

Gamble, 139 S. Ct. at 2008-09 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting)                   
(citations omitted).  The correction of the blatant violation of          
the fundamental constitutional right against double jeopardy, in          
light of the relationship between the federal government and the          
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as one single sovereign, is a                 
substantive new rule that is retroactive on collateral review.            
   C.   The Puerto Rico Courts’ Retroactivity Analysis of               
        Sánchez–Valle was Contrary to or an Unreasonable                
        Application of Clearly Established Federal Law.                 
   “The junction where federal habeas power intersects with             
state criminal processes is enswathed in a mutuality of respect           
between sovereigns.  It is that principle of comity which                 
underlies the federal courts’ unwillingness to adjudicate too             
hastily matters of fundamental federal significance arising out           
of state prosecutions.”  Nadworny v. Fair, 872 F.2d 1093, 1096            
(1st Cir. 1989).  “The federal habeas review provided for in              
[section] 2254 exists ‘to rescue those in custody from the [the           
state courts’] failure to apply federal rights, correctly or at           
all.’”  Evariste v. Massachusetts, No. CV 20-10151-DPW, 2022 WL           
1625000, at *5 (D. Mass. May 23, 2022) (Woodlock, J.) (emphasis           
added) (quoting Nadworny, 872 F.2d at 1096).  With the utmost             
respect to the Puerto Rico courts, they did not apply clearly             
established federal law concerning retroactivity.                         

   In the context of the Rule 192.1 decision, the Court of              
First Instance, and later the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals,               
ruled that they were bound by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico’s          
determination that Sánchez Valle only applied retroactively to            
those cases in which the judgment was not final and                       
unappealable.  See P.R. Ct. First Instance Res. 4-5; P.R. Cir.            
Ct. Res. 7.  Those courts relied upon the Puerto Rico Supreme             
Court’s holding in Puerto Rico v. Torres Irizarry.  See Second            
Mot. Submitting Certified Trans., Ex. 1, Offic. Trans. P.R.               
Supreme Ct., Puerto Rico v. Torres Irizarry, CC-2014-1030                 
(“Offic. Trans. Puerto Rico v. Torres Irizarry”), ECF No. 41-1.           

   In Puerto Rico v. Torres Irizarry, the Supreme Court of              
Puerto Rico held that Sánchez–Valle “must have a retroactive              
effect” with respect to the case before it.  Id. 12-13.  In that          
case there had been a judgment of conviction, but appellate               
rights had not been finally exhausted.  Id. 3, 5.  Thus, the              
Puerto Rico Supreme Court’s retroactivity analysis, citing                
Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1987), concerned cases that           
were not final, see Offic. Trans. Puerto Rico v. Torres Irizarry          
3, 12.                                                                    
   The Puerto Rico Supreme Court did not determine                      
retroactivity as to final convictions because that issue was not          
before the Court.  Rather, in that narrow retroactivity context,          

“and because there [was] no final sentence rendered in the case           
at bar,” it was held proper “to apply retroactively the rule              
laid down in Sánchez Valle.”  Id. 13 (emphasis added).  As                
argued by Núñez Pérez, and after reviewing the Official                   
Translation, Torres Irizarry is inapposite to the situation               
here, as that case understandably avoided a broad holding that            
was not required.                                                         
   The lower courts in Puerto Rico, absent further guidance             
from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, failed to address federal          
retroactivity law by relying on Torres Irizarry as to the case            
at bar.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court declined certiorari.  By           
failing to apply federal law to Núñez Pérez case, those courts            

have acted contrary to federal law, specifically the Supreme              
Court’s retroactivity analysis.                                           
   To sum up, as between the United States and the                      
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Sánchez–Valle conclusively held              
they are one-and-the-same for purposes of Double Jeopardy.  It            
is anathema to our system of justice that an unconstitutional             
prosecution, conviction, and restraint on liberty be permitted            
to stand on specious notions of finality and reliance.  The               
Puerto Rico courts failed to apply the Supreme Court’s federal            
retroactivity analysis, and therefore that “decision was                  
contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly          
established Federal law,”  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).  Sánchez–              

Valle is retroactive.  Where there is no dispute that the                 
federal conviction for carjacking with resultant death and the            
Puerto Rico convictions for carjacking and manslaughter are               
identical –- and they are –- a writ of habeas corpus is                   
appropriate and shall enter as set forth below.  The remaining            
convictions are not identical and therefore do not invoke Double          
Jeopardy concerns.                                                        
IV.  CONCLUSION AND ORDER                                               
   For the aforementioned reasons, the motion to dismiss, ECF           
No. 17, is hereby DENIED and a writ of habeas corpus shall enter          
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), striking in part the                  
conviction and sentence only as to the Commonwealth of Puerto             

Rico carjacking and manslaughter judgments, but in all other              
respect the convictions and sentences shall stand.  The                   
execution of the writ of habeas corpus shall be STAYED until the          
expiration of the appeal period for this order and, if an appeal          
is filed, the resolution of any appeal, absent further order of           
this Court, the First Circuit Court of Appeals, or the Supreme            
Court.
