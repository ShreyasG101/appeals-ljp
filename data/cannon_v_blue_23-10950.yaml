outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Scott Cannon, individually and as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Blaise Cannon''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to BCBS on the basis of ERISA preemption for his state law wrongful death and punitive damages claims.

  2. Appellant contended that the Supreme Court''s decision in Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, 592 U.S. 80 (2020), overrules prior law and requires reinstatement of his wrongful death and punitive damages suit, as Rutledge changes the analysis of ERISA preemption.

  3. Appellant argued that the Massachusetts wrongful death statute is not intended to regulate insurance or have any effect on insurance plans, and therefore should not be preempted by ERISA.

  4. Appellant contended that he is not a plan participant or beneficiary either in his individual capacity or as a representative of the decedent''s estate, and thus his wrongful death claim is not preempted by ERISA.

  5. Appellant argued that the plan participant or beneficiary could not have brought the wrongful death claim because it did not arise until after Blaise''s death, and therefore the claim is not preempted by ERISA.'
