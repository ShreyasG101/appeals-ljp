reason_for_appeal: '=== National Trust for Historic Preservation; Friends of the Frank J. Wood Bridge''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acted arbitrarily and capriciously under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by failing to consider updated cost information in Maine Department of Transportation''s (MDOT) possession when reassessing the relative costs of bridge rehabilitation and replacement.

  2. Appellants contended that the FHWA should have recalculated the cost differential between rehabilitation and replacement alternatives in light of significant increases in construction costs since the original estimates, rather than limiting its inquiry to the previously identified 53% price differential.

  3. Appellants asserted that the FHWA''s decision to continue assuming that rehabilitation would cost roughly 53% more than new construction was arbitrary and capricious, given the new cost data and updated estimates provided by their expert, Robert Shulock.

  4. Appellants claimed that the agency''s refusal to reopen the record and recalculate the differential using updated cost information was itself arbitrary and capricious.

  5. Appellants stated in a footnote that they believed the agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by ignoring new information, though they focused their appeal primarily on the alleged violation of Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act.'
