outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Cheriese D. Johnson''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Johnson argued in the administrative appeal of Reliance Standard’s denial that because neither she nor any of her doctors suspected or diagnosed scleroderma during the three‑month lookback period, she could not have received medical treatment ''for'' scleroderma during that period, so scleroderma did not qualify as a preexisting condition under the policy.

  2. In her ERISA suit and on appeal from the district court’s summary judgment, Johnson contended that the long‑term disability plan, properly interpreted under its plain language, entitled her to benefits because the preexisting‑condition exclusion applies only when medical treatment is rendered for the specific sickness or injury, not merely for generic symptoms that are, in hindsight, consistent with that sickness.

  3. Johnson further maintained that Reliance Standard, as the insurer invoking a policy exclusion, bore the burden of proving that the preexisting‑condition limitation applied, and that it failed to meet that burden because the record showed only treatment for undiagnosed, nonspecific symptoms rather than treatment for scleroderma itself during the lookback period.'
