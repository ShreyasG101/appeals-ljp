outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== State Farm Fire and Casualty Company''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. State Farm argued that the district court erred by holding that Babwari’s negligence claim provided the basis for liability in the underlying consent judgment, given that the consent judgment did not specify which of Babwari’s three claims (negligence, wantonness, or Employer’s Liability Act) supported liability.

  2. State Farm contended that Babwari’s injuries were not covered by the policy because they did not constitute an "occurrence" within the meaning of the policy’s definition of that term.

  3. State Farm further argued that, even if the injuries otherwise fell within the policy’s coverage, the employer’s liability exclusion barred coverage for Babwari’s injuries because they arose out of and in the course of his employment or the performance of duties related to the conduct of the insured’s business.'
