outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Anna Gristina''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in abstaining from exercising jurisdiction under the Younger abstention doctrine, contending that her federal suit to unseal state court transcripts did not fall within any of the exceptional categories warranting Younger abstention.

  2. Appellant contended that the state court''s refusal to unseal the transcripts violated her federal due process and equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, including her right to access the courts.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court erred in applying the Rooker-Feldman doctrine as an alternative ground for dismissal, asserting that her federal claims were not barred by that doctrine.

  4. Appellant asserted that the state court could not have addressed her federal claims or provided the requested relief, and therefore federal jurisdiction was proper.

  5. Appellant argued for the first time on appeal that ''great and immediate irreparable harm'' and Defendants-Appellees’ alleged bad faith compelled an exception to Younger abstention.'
