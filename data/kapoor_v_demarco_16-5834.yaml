outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Monika Kapoor''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court had jurisdiction to adjudicate her claim under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(4) did not bar habeas review of her CAT claim in the extradition context.

  2. Appellant contended that the Secretary of State''s decision to extradite her violated her procedural and substantive due process rights, as well as the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT) and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), because she would likely be tortured if returned to India and the Secretary erred in finding otherwise.

  3. Appellant argued that the district court’s certification of the extradition request was stale due to the dismissal of two charges and the possibility that the remaining charges could be resolved by fines, making them non-extraditable offenses.

  4. Appellant claimed that the district court violated her due process rights by first indicating it had jurisdiction to review her CAT claim during oral argument but then denying jurisdiction in its ruling, and by failing to address her due process arguments raised at oral argument and in supplemental briefing.

  5. Appellant asserted that the lack of judicial review of her CAT claim in the extradition context violated the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution.'
