outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Peter Schuman and William Coplin''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellants argued that the district court applied the wrong legal test to determine the enforceability of their ERISA releases by strictly adopting the First and Second Circuits’ six-factor "knowing and voluntary" test without considering Microchip’s alleged breach of fiduciary duty in obtaining the releases.

  2. Appellants contended that, even if they knowingly and voluntarily signed the releases, the releases were nonetheless unenforceable because Microchip violated its ERISA fiduciary duties by misinterpreting the Plan as expired and by obtaining releases in exchange for sharply reduced severance payments when it knew or should have known that employees were still entitled to benefits under the Plan, contrary to Microchip’s misrepresentations.

  3. Appellants asserted that ERISA requires a form of heightened or special scrutiny of waivers and releases of ERISA claims that incorporates alleged fiduciary misconduct into the enforceability analysis, rather than treating such misconduct as separate from the "knowing and voluntary" inquiry.


  === Microchip Technology Inc., Atmel Corporation, and Atmel Corporation United States Severance Guarantee Benefit Program''s Grounds for Cross-Appeal ===

  1. Cross-appellants argued that the district court erred by denying summary judgment as to the non-named plaintiffs’ claims instead of applying the judgment entered against Schuman and Coplin to the rest of the class, thereby failing to extinguish the non-named plaintiffs’ claims.

  2. Cross-appellants contended that pendent appellate jurisdiction or the collateral order doctrine should permit appellate review of the district court’s denial of summary judgment as to the non-named plaintiffs in conjunction with the interlocutory appeal concerning the enforceability of the releases.'
