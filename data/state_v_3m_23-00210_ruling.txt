       ORDER ON MOTIONS TO REMAND AND STAY                           

Based on a state plaintiff’s express and enforceable disclaimer against seeking 
recovery in this lawsuit from the defendants for claims relating to aqueous film-
forming foam, the sole basis for federal jurisdiction, this Court concludes that it does 
not have jurisdiction over a parens patriae lawsuit against manufacturers of per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances and grants the state’s motion to remand the case to state 
court.  The Court declines to stay ruling on the motion to remand while the United 
States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation rules on a motion to transfer the case 
to a multidistrict litigation proceeding because the Court has determined that in any 
event, it does not have jurisdiction over the lawsuit.                    
I.   BACKGROUND                                                           

A.   Two Lawsuits                                                    
On March 29, 2023, the state of Maine (Maine or State) in its parens patriae1 
capacity filed two separate civil actions against 3M Company and other defendants 

1     A parens patriae lawsuit “involves a matter of sovereign or quasi-sovereign interest and is 
brought by a state on behalf of all its citizens.”  New Hampshire v. 3M Corporation, No. 22-cv-145-LM, 
(collectively 3M) in state of Maine Superior Court for Cumberland County.  Notice of 
Removal, State of Me. v. 3M Co., No. 2:23-cv-00197-JAW, Attach. 3, Compl., (ECF No. 
1) (AFFF Compl.), id., State Ct. R., Attach. 1, State Ct. Docket (filed under state docket 

number PORSC-CV-2023-00122) (ECF No. 9); Notice of Removal, State of Me. v. 3M 
Co., No. 2:23-cv-00210-JAW, Attach. 3, Compl., (ECF No. 1) (Non-AFFF Compl.), id., 
State Ct. R., Attach. 1, State Ct. Docket (filed under state docket number PORSC-CV-
2023-00121) (ECF No. 15).  Both lawsuits involve per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS).  But the first lawsuit — docket number 2:23-cv-00197-JAW — is directed to 
the use of aqueous film-forming foam, and the second lawsuit — docket number 2:23-

cv-00210-JAW — is not.  The parties refer to the two complaints as either the AFFF 
Complaint (2:23-cv-00197-JAW) or the Non-AFFF Complaint (2:23-cv-00210-JAW).      
B.   The AFFF Complaint                                              
Turning first to the AFFF Complaint, 3M removed the case from state to 
federal court on May 8, 2023.  Notice of Removal (ECF No. 1).  On May 24, 2023, the 
United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) issued a conditional 
transfer order, accepting the case as a tag-along action for transfer to the United 

States District Court for the District of South Carolina in In re: Aqueous Film-
Forming Foam Products Liability Litigation, MDL Conditional Transfer Order (ECF 
No. 14) (MDL Litigation).  On June 9, 2023, that order was certified, id., MDL 
Conditional  Transfer  Order  (ECF  No.  15),  and  the  Clerk’s  Office  electronically 
transferred the case to the MDL in United States District Court for the District of 


2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53461, at*3 n.1 (D.N.H. March 29, 2023) (citation and internal quotations 
omitted).                                                                 
South Carolina. (ECF No. 16).  The transfer of the AFFF Complaint to the District of 
South Carolina appears noncontroversial.                                  
C.   The Non-AFFF Complaint                                          

The same cannot be said for the Non-AFFF Complaint.  On May 17, 2023, 3M 
removed the case to this Court.  Case No. 2:23-cv-00210-JAW, Notice of Removal (ECF 
No. 1).  On May 25, 2023, the State moved to remand the case to state of Maine 
Superior Court and for expedited briefing.  State of Me.’s Mot. to Remand (ECF No. 
10) (Mot. to Remand); State of Me.’s Mot. for Expedited Briefing and Consideration of 
Mot. to Remand (ECF No. 11).  On June 1, 2023, the JPML declined to accept the 

Non-AFFF Complaint as part of the MDL Litigation.  Notice of Counsel (ECF No. 18).  
On June 8, 2023, 3M filed a motion to stay the Non-AFFF litigation until the JPML 
resolves 3M’s motion to transfer the Non-AFFF Litigation to the District of South 
Carolina for disposition with the MDL Litigation there.  Def. 3M Company’s Mot. to 
Stay (ECF No. 31) (Mot. to Stay).  On June 15, 2023, 3M responded to the State’s 
motion to remand and the State responded to 3M’s motion to stay.  Def. 3M Company’s 
Obj. to State of Me.’s Mot. to Remand (ECF No. 34) (3M Remand Opp’n); Pl.’s Opp’n 

to Def. 3M Company’s Mot. to Stay (ECF No. 35) (State’s Stay Opp’n).  On June 22, 
2023, 3M filed a reply in support of its motion to stay and the State filed a reply in 
support of its motion to remand.  Def. 3M Company’s Reply in Support of Mot. to Stay 
(ECF No. 37) (3M Stay Reply); State of Me.’s Reply in Support of Mot. to Remand (ECF 
No. 38) (State Remand Reply).                                             
D.   The Motions to Strike, File a Surreply, and Expedite Briefing   
On June 27, 2023, 3M filed a motion to strike or, in the alternative, a motion 
for leave to file a surreply.  Def. 3M Company’s Mot. to Strike Decl. and Portions of 
Pl.’s Reply in Support of Mot. to Remand or, in the Alternative, for Leave to File 

Surreply (ECF No. 39) (3M’s Mot. to Strike).  On July 1, 2023, the State filed an 
opposition to the motion to strike or file surreply.  Pl. State of Me.’s Opp’n to Def. 3M 
Company’s Mot. to Strike Decl. and Portions of Pl.’s Reply in Support of Mot. to 
Remand or, in the Alternative, for Leave to File Surreply (ECF No. 41) (State’s Strike 
Opp’n).  On July 1, 2023, the State also filed a motion for expedited briefing and 
consideration of 3M’s motion to strike or file surreply.  Pl. State of Me.’s Mot. for 

Expedited Briefing and Consideration of 3M’s Mot. to Strike Decl. and Portions of Pl.’s 
Reply in Support of Mot. to Remand or, in the Alternative, for Leave to File Surreply 
(ECF No. 42) (State’s Expedited Mot.).                                    
On July 5, 2023, the Court addressed and resolved a controversy between the 
parties concerning the motion to strike, the motion to stay, and the motion for 
expedited briefing.  Order on Mot. to Strike, Mot. to Stay, and Mot. for Expedited 
Briefing (ECF No. 44).  On July 12, 2023, 3M filed a surreply, 3M Co.’s Surreply in 

Opp’n to Mot. to Remand (ECF No. 45) (3M’s Surreply), and on July 17, 2023, the 
State filed a surrebuttal.  State of Maine’s Rebuttal to Def. 3M Co.’s Surreply to State 
of Maine’s Mot. to Remand (ECF No. 46) (State Surrebuttal).               
II.   THE CONTROVERSY                                                     
In filing two lawsuits in state court, the State has attempted to make a “sharp 
distinction” between PFAS and AFFF contamination with one lawsuit devoted to 
PFAS contamination and the other to AFFF contamination.  Mot. to Remand at 5.  By 
its drafting of the two complaints, the State has chosen a state court forum for its 
Non-AFFF complaint, while conceding the federal forum for its AFFF claims.  Id.   

In its opposition to the State’s motion to remand, 3M contends that the “State’s 
attempt to split its claims and plead around federal jurisdiction fails.”  3M’s Remand 
Opp’n at 1.  3M explains that the AFFF claims fall within federal jurisdiction because 
AFFF was manufactured in compliance with specifications from the United States 
Military (MilSpec AFFF) and therefore are subject to federal officer jurisdiction.  Id.  
3M maintains that AFFF and Non-AFFF sources of contamination are commingled 

and at the very least, 3M has the right to also assert federal government contractor 
defenses to the Non-AFFF claims.  Id. at 6.  This dispute also provides the context for 
3M’s motion to stay in which 3M is asking the Court to delay disposition of the motion 
to remand until the JPML issues a ruling on whether the Non-AFFF lawsuit may be 
accepted into the MDL Litigation.  Mot. to Stay at 1-14.                  
In its opposition to the motion to stay, the State attached a sworn declaration 
of Victoria Eleftheriou.  State’s Stay Opp’n, Attach. 1, Decl. of Victoria Eleftheriou in 

Support  of  Pl.’s  Opp’n  to  3M  Company’s  Mot.  to  Stay  (Eleftheriou  Decl.).    Ms. 
Eleftheriou,  the  Deputy  Director  of  the  Maine  Department  of  Environmental 
Protection’s Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management, essentially reviews the 
specific sites that are the subject of the Non-AFFF contamination litigation and 
represents that there is no evidence of AFFF contamination in those PFAS sites.  Id. 
at 1-7.                                                                   
This description sets the stage for the State’s motion to remand and 3M’s 
motion to stay, except to note that from the perspective of the State, there is some 
urgency.  After June 1, 2023, when the JPML declined to accept transfer of the Non-

AFFF lawsuit into the MDL Litigation, 3M moved for the JPML to accept the Non-
AFFF lawsuit.  3M’s Mot. to Stay at 3-4.  The parties later received notice that the 
JPML would hear 3M’s transfer motion at its meeting on July 27, 2023.  3M Stay 
Reply, Attach. 1, JPML Notice of Hr’g Session at 4.  The State is very concerned that 
once 3M’s motion to transfer is considered by the JPML, it will substantially delay 
the disposition of its motion to remand.  State Stay Opp’n at 13.  The State therefore 

has urged the Court to issue a ruling on the motion to remand before the JPML acts 
on 3M’s motion to transfer and 3M has urged the Court to delay ruling on the motion 
to remand until the JPML has issued its ruling.                           
III.  THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES                                        
A.   The Motion to Remand                                            
     1.   The State’s Motion to Remand                               
On May 25, 2023, the State moved to remand this case to state of Maine 

Superior Court.  Mot. to Remand at 5-15.  First, the State stresses that it deliberately 
divided its civil actions between the AFFF and the Non-AFFF lawsuits.  Id. at 5.  The 
AFFF lawsuit is now subject to the MDL Litigation in South Carolina and the State 
nowhere argues that this transfer was improper.  Id. at 5-15.  By contrast, in its Non-
AFFF  lawsuit,  the  State  expressly  disclaimed  “seeking  relief  for  AFFF-related 
contamination: ‘The State is not seeking to recover through this Complaint any relief 
for contamination or injury related to Aqueous Film Forming Foam.’”  Id. at 9 
(quoting Compl. ¶ 15).                                                    
For the AFFF complaint, the State acknowledges that this Court may have 

jurisdiction under so-called “federal officer jurisdiction”.  Id. at 6.  Federal officer 
jurisdiction can be a “colorable federal defense to [a] lawsuit,” where there is a “nexus 
between the allegations in the complaint and conduct undertaken at the behest of a 
federal officer.”  Id. at 6-7 (quoting Rhode Island v. Shell Oil Prod. Co., 979 F.3d 50, 
59 (1st Cir. 2020), vacated on other grounds 141 S. Ct. 2666 (2021) (Rhode Island I)).   
However, the State contends that federal officer jurisdiction is not available for the 

Non-AFFF complaint.  Id. at 6-7.                                          
The State observes that to establish federal officer jurisdiction, 3M points to 
four sites — the Army National Guard facility in Bangor, the former Loring Air Force 
Base  in  Aroostook  County,  the  former  Brunswick  Naval  Air  Station,  and  the 
Portsmouth  Naval  Shipyard  —  where  3M  asserts  that  PFAS  and  AFFF  were 
commingled.  Id. at 7-8.  But the State says that there is no evidence of commingling 
on any of these four sites.  Id.  Moreover, the State goes on to state that none of these 

four sites was identified in its Non-AFFF complaint.  Id. at 8-9.  In addition, the State 
reiterates that even if 3M could demonstrate commingling, the State disclaimed in 
this lawsuit any relief from the Non-AFFF complaint.  Id. at 9.  For support, the State 
points to two court decisions in the First Circuit: New Hampshire v. 3M Corporation, 
No. 22-cv-145-LM, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53461 (D.N.H. Mar. 29, 2023) and Rhode 
Island I, 979 F.3d 50.   The State then distinguishes the cases it anticipated 3M would 
cite for support.  Id. at 9-13.                                           
There is a second possible source of federal jurisdiction — federal enclave 

jurisdiction.  Id. at 14.  The State anticipates that 3M will maintain that Portsmouth 
Naval Shipyard and the Brunswick Naval Air Station were federal enclaves, thereby 
affording federal jurisdiction.  Id.  But the State relies on a First Circuit case, Rhode 
Island v. Shell Oil Products, Company, 35 F.4th 44 (1st Cir. 2022) (Rhode Island II), 
to argue that federal enclave jurisdiction is not available to 3M.  Id.   
     2.   3M’s Opposition to Remand                                  

3M begins its opposition by disputing the premise of the State’s argument: 
namely, that PFS and AFFF sources of contamination can be neatly separated.  3M 
Remand  Opp’n  at  5-6.    Instead,  3M  says  that  “PFAS  can  move  through  the 
environment  —  both  from  natural  processes  like  transport  in  groundwater  and 
because people collect, move and spread PFAS-containing waste — so PFAS from 
AFFF and non-AFFF sources plausibly have commingled at various locations.”  Id. at 
6 (emphasis in original).  3M maintains that “MilSpec AFFF thus is at issue even in 

this putative ‘non-AFFF’ case for statewide damages.”  Id.   3M contends that AFFF 
was used in military sites throughout Maine and that the State alleged in its AFFF 
lawsuit that PFAS and AFFF contaminated sites throughout the state of Maine.  Id. 
at 8-9.  3M relies particularly on Nessel v. Chemguard, Inc., No. 1:20-cv-1080, 2021 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39175 (W.D. Mich. Jan. 6. 2021) and In Re AFFF Products Liability 
Litigation, No. 18-nm-2873, ECF No. 325 (D.S.C. Oct. 1. 2019).  Id. at 10-11.  3M says 
that the New Hampshire case was “wrongly decided” and notes that it is currently on 
appeal before the First Circuit.  Id. at 6, n.3.                          
3M posits that the State’s disclaimer of AFFF liability does not preclude federal 

jurisdiction.  Id. at 13.  This is because, 3M observes, the well-pleaded complaint rule 
does  not  apply  to  federal  officer  removal.    Id.    3M  then  disputes  the  State’s 
interpretation of relevant caselaw.  Id. at 13-16.                        
Regarding federal enclave jurisdiction, 3M says that the State does not dispute 
that Brunswick Naval Air Station and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard were federal 
enclaves and used AFFF.  Id. at 16.  3M argues that this Court therefore has 

supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.  Id. at 16-17.           
     3.   The State’s Reply                                          
In reply, the State contends that 3M’s arguments in favor of federal jurisdiction 
are “conclusory, speculative and controverted by actual evidence.”  State Remand 
Reply at 5.  The State analyzes each case 3M cited and maintains that they do not 
support 3M’s contentions.  Id. at 7-9.  Discussing Rhode Island II, the State writes 
that this case does not support federal jurisdiction because all pertinent events did 

not take place on the federal enclaves.  Id. at 10-11.                    
     4.   3M’s Surreply                                              
In its surreply, 3M focuses on the sworn declaration of Victoria Eleftheriou 
(attached to the State’s reply to the motion to stay), and argues that the Court should 
not consider her statements for three reasons: (1) because they are “legally irrelevant 
to whether 3M adequately alleged a plausible basis for federal officer jurisdiction in 
its Notice of Removal,” (2) even if the Court considered the Eleftheriou statements, 
they “do not address – much less controvert – most of the facts 3M averred in support 
of federal officer jurisdiction,” and (3) it would be “error to order remand based on the 

Declaration without giving 3M a fair opportunity to contest it.”  3M Surreply at 1.   
     5.   The State’s Surrebuttal                                    
In its surrebuttal, the State argues that 3M has conceded that the lawsuits 
involving two water districts, which were the subject of Deputy Director Eleftheriou’s 
declaration, are irrelevant to the Court’s remand determination.  State’s Surrebuttal 
at 8.  But the State’s overall response is that the Court does not need to consider the 

Eleftheriou declaration to rule on the motion to remand.  Id. at 4.  Finally, the State 
rejects  3M’s  discovery  demand,  pointing  out  that  the  Eleftheriou  declaration’s 
reference to the water districts is not mentioned in the 3M Notice of Removal and 
that 3M has not created a reasonable expectation that discovery would reveal facts 
relevant to the Court’s remand decision.  Id. at 10.  The State ends by arguing that 
“3M does not want discovery, it wants delay.”  Id. at 11.                 
B.   The Motion to Stay                                              

     1.   3M’s Motion to Stay                                        
On June 8, 2023, 3M moved this Court to defer action on the State’s motion to 
remand until the JPML has ruled on its motion for transfer.  3M’s Stay Mot. at 1-10.  
Quoting Good v. Altria Group, Inc., 624 F. Supp. 2d 132 (D. Me. 2009), 3M points out 
that “[c]ourts frequently grant stays pending a decision by the [JPML] regarding 
whether to transfer a case.”  Id. at 5 (quoting Good, 624 F. Supp. 2d at 134).  3M notes 
that if the JPML accepts the case for transfer, the MDL would have the authority to 
rule on the motion to remand, and a MDL ruling on the motion to remand would have 
the benefit of consistency and judicial economy.  Id. at 6.               

3M then argues that this case would be a “good candidate for transfer” to the 
MDL.  Id.  3M observes that the State’s other AFFF case has already been transferred 
to the MDL.  Id.  3M contends that the JPML has accepted transfer in other cases 
similar to Maine’s Non-AFFF case on the ground that the same water sources were 
involved.  Id. at 6-7.                                                    
3M discounts any prejudice to the state of Maine by a stay.  Id. at 7-8.  3M 

notes that the JPML is scheduled to hear the motion for transfer on July 27, 2023,2 
and it asserts that the JPML typically issues a decision on a motion for transfer 
within a week or two of the hearing session.  Id.  By contrast, if this Court issues an 
order  on  the  motion  to  remand,  3M  raises  the  specter  of  inconsistent  remand 
decisions, which it argues would greatly prejudice 3M.  Id.               
     2.   The State’s Opposition to the Motion to Stay               
The State strenuously objects to 3M’s motion to stay.  State Stay Opp’n at 1-

14.  The State’s main point is that the JPML will not address the issue the State has 
raised: namely, whether federal jurisdiction is proper for this Court.  Id. at 5.  The 
State maintains that the JPML “reviews only whether, on the face of the various 
complaints, there is apparent overlap between a given complaint and an MDL.”  Id.  


2    At the filing of 3M’s motion, it was unclear whether the JPML would hear the 3M motion for 
transfer on July 27, 2023 or September 28, 2023.  3M Stay Mot. at 8.  Since then, the JPML scheduled 
the motion for transfer without oral argument for the hearing session of July 27, 2023.  3M Stay Reply, 
Attach. 1, JPML Notice of Hr’g Session at 4.                              
The State contends that to allow the JPML to consider whether to accept this case 
would “needless delay the case even as the State urgently seeks to move it forward to 
obtain the funds needed to clean up Maine’s environment.”  Id.  The State says that 

“[i]n  view  of  established  principles  of  comity  and  federalism,  subject  mater 
jurisdiction can and should be decided at the very outset of the litigation, particularly 
in a case brought by the sovereign in its own state’s court.”  Id.        
     3.   3M’s Reply to the State’s Stay Opposition                  
In its reply, 3M cites Good and other cases, in which courts have granted a stay 
to allow the JPML to rule on whether it would accept transfer into the MDL.  3M’s 

Stay Reply at 4-8.  Alternatively, 3M argues that the analysis in Meyers v. Bayer AG, 
143 F. Supp. 2d 1044 (E.D. Wisc. 2001) counsels against deciding the jurisdictional 
issue here because 3M views the jurisdictional issue as factually and legally complex.  
Id. at 8-9.  3M deflects any prejudice on the part of the State from a stay and requests 
that the Court defer decision until the JPML has decided the pending motion to 
transfer.  Id. at 10.                                                     
IV.  DISCUSSION                                                           

Preliminarily, this Court retains jurisdiction to consider the motion to remand:  
“The  pendency  of  a  motion,  order  to  show  cause,  conditional  transfer  order  or 
conditional remand order before the Panel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407 does not 
affect or suspend orders and pretrial proceedings in any pending federal district court 
action and does not limit the pretrial jurisdiction of that court.”  Nessel, 2021 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 39175, at *5-6 (quoting JPML R. 2.1(d)).                      
In analyzing the dueling motions to stay and remand, the Court is fortunate 
that it does not operate from a blank slate.  First, the Court finds persuasive the 
“three-step  methodology”  for  “balance[ing]  the  imperative  of  ensuring  federal 

jurisdiction and the benefits of multidistrict litigation” announced in Meyers, 143 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1049 and recently applied in the District of Maine in Eastern Maine 
Medical Center v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 581 F. Supp. 3d 281, 285-86 (D. 
Me. 2022). The Court adopts Chief Judge Levy’s observation that “[t]his three-step 
approach  appropriately  accommodates  the  fundamentality  of  subject-matter 
jurisdiction within the federal system and the virtues of judicial economy, efficiency, 

and consistency promoted by multidistrict litigation.”  Id.  In Eastern Maine, quoting 
Meyers, Chief Judge Levy described the three-step methodology:            
First, if a “preliminary assessment suggests that removal was improper, 
the court should promptly . . . remand the case to state court.” Meyers, 
143 F. Supp. 2d at 1049.  But if the preliminary assessment instead  
reveals that the jurisdictional issue is “factually or legally difficult, the 
court's second step should be to determine whether identical or similar 
jurisdictional issues have been raised in other cases that have been or 
may be transferred to the” multidistrict litigation.  Id.  If so, “the court 
proceed[s] to the third step and consider[s] the motion to stay,” although 
this third step “does not mandate that a stay should be granted.” Id. 

E. Maine, 581 F. Supp. 3d at 285.  In accordance with the first step of the three-step 
methodology, the Court turns first to the motion to remand and next addresses the 
motion for stay.  Next, in addressing the first step of the Meyers analysis, the Court 
has the benefit of a recent decision on a similar question authored by Chief Judge 
Landya McCafferty of the District of New Hampshire in New Hampshire, 2023 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 53461, at *1-28, a case currently on appeal to the Court of Appeals for 
the First Circuit.                                                        
A.   Motion to Remand                                                

In the two state of Maine complaints, the State has sought to proceed on two 
distinct factual and legal theories: an AFFF lawsuit, which it concedes has been 
properly transferred to the MDL, and a Non-AFFF lawsuit, which it contends is not 
subject to federal jurisdiction.  In a typical case, the State as plaintiff is the “master” 
of its complaint.  The Fair v. Kohler Die and Specialty Co., 228 U.S. 22, 25 (1913) 
(Holmes, J.).  This precept known as the “well-pleaded complaint rule” concentrates 

a court’s attention “on the complaint’s terms” and its analysis is “unaided by anything 
alleged in anticipation or avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may 
interpose.” Rhode Island II, 35 F.4th at 51 (citing Taylor v. Anderson, 234 U.S. 74, 
75-76 (1914)).  Based on this precept alone, the State’s position on remand would be 
unassailable because the State-drafted complaints carefully differentiate between the 
AFFF and Non-AFFF lawsuits, and the Non-AFFF complaint, especially given its 
disavowal of any AFFF claim, would be appropriate for remand.  See New Hampshire, 

2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53461, at *28 (“[I]n most circumstances, the non-federal cast 
of a complaint would prevent a defendant from removing it”); Rhode Island II, 35 
F.4th at 51.  Thus, to the extent 3M purports to remove this case to federal court 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441, see Notice of Removal at 1 (“Defendant 3M Company 
[3M] by undersigned counsel hereby gives notice of removal of this action, pursuant 
to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441, 1442(a)(1), and 1446”), a straightforward review of the 
Non-AFFF complaint would dictate remand.                                  
But federal jurisdictional law is seldom so simple.  As a basis for removal, 3M 

also invokes § 1442(a)(1), the federal officer removal statute.  In 1999, the United 
States Supreme Court wrote:                                               
To remove a case as one falling within federal-question jurisdiction, the 
federal question ordinarily must appear on the face of a properly pleaded 
complaint; an anticipated or actual federal defense generally does not 
qualify a case for removal. See Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley, 
211 U.S. 149 (1908).  Suits against federal officers are exceptional in this 
regard. Under the federal officer removal statute, suits against federal 
officers may be removed despite the nonfederal cast of the complaint; 
the federal question element is met if the defense depends on federal 
law.                                                                 

Jefferson Cnty., Ala. v. Acker, 527 U.S. 423, 430-31 (1999).  Since Jefferson County, 
Congress broadened the application of the federal officer removal statute to include 
cases where there is only a connection or association between the act in question and 
the federal office.  See Sawyer v. Forster Wheeler, 860 F.3d 249, 258 (4th Cir. 2017).3   
Judge McCafferty explained the nexus requirement:                    
The requirement that a claim be "for" or "relate to" the alleged federal 
authority is a "nexus" requirement, but not a causation requirement.  
Moore [v. Elec. Boat Corp.,] 25 F.4th [30,] 34 & n.2 [1st Cir. 2022].  That 
is, only a "nexus" between the claims and the alleged official authority 

3    In Sawyer v. Foster Wheeler, LLC, 860 F.3d 249 (4th Cir. 2017), the Fourth Circuit observed 
that before 2011, the statutory test in § 1442 was whether “there was a causal connection between the 
charged conduct and the asserted official authority.”  Id. at 258 (quoting Jefferson Cnty., 527 U.S. at 
431).  However, in 2011, Congress broadened § 1442(a)(1) to cover actions “for or relating to any act 
under color of [federal] office," adding the words "or relating to” Removal Clarification Act of 2011, 
Publ. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545.  Id. (emphasis in Sawyer).  This new language “broaden[ed] the 
universe of acts” that enable federal removal, H.R. Rep. 112-17, 6, 2011 U.S.C.C.A.N. 420, 425, such 
that there need be only “‘a connection or association between the act in question and the federal office.’”  
Papp v. Fore-Kast Sales Co., 842 F.3d 805, 813 (3d Cir. 2016) (emphasis added) (quoting In re 
Commonwealth’s Mot. to Appoint Counsel Against or Directed to Defender Assoc., 790 F.3d 457, 471 
(3d Cir. 2015)).                                                          
need exist; it is sufficient that at least one of the plaintiff's claims is 
“connected” or “associated” with the defendant's acts under color of 
federal office.  Baker v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 962 F.3d 937, 943-44 (7th 
Cir. 2020) (explaining that 2011 amendments to § 1442(a)(1) removed  
requirement of causal connection and collecting appellate cases holding 
likewise).                                                           

New Hampshire, 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53461, at *21-22.                    

Applying this precedent, the Court turns to whether there is a connection or 
association between the allegations in the Non-AFFF lawsuit and a federal office.  
The Court briefly returns to the legal standards.  In Rhode Island I, the First Circuit 
described the standard:                                                   
Private actors sued in state court can remove the case to federal court 
where the private actor is “acting under [any federal officer], for any act 
under color of such office.”  28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1); accord Camacho v. 
Autoridad de Telefonos de Puerto Rico, 868 F.2d 482, 486-87 (1st Cir. 
1989).  “Acting under” connotes “subjection, guidance, or control” and 
involves “an effort to assist, or to help carry out, the duties or tasks of 
the federal superior.”  Watson v. Phillip Morris Companies, Inc., 551 
U.S. 142, 152 (2007) (citations omitted).                            

979 F.3d at 59.  The Rhode Island I Court went on to state:               

To succeed in their argument that federal-officer removal is proper in 
this case, the oil companies must show that they were acting under a 
federal  officer's  authority,  that  they  will  assert  a  colorable  federal 
defense  to  the  suit,  and  that  there  exists  "a  nexus"  between  the 
allegations in the complaint and conduct undertaken at the behest of a 
federal officer.  Jefferson Cty., 527 U.S. at 431 (internal quotation marks 
and citations omitted).  If the oil companies cannot demonstrate all three 
of these elements, they cannot remove the case to federal court under 
§ 1442.                                                              

Id.  As Chief Judge McCaffrey noted, unlike a § 1441 removal, a removal under § 
1442(a)(1) “is broadly construed ’in favor of removal.’”  New Hampshire, 2023 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 53461, at *21 (citing Watson, 551 U.S. at  147-48  (emphasis in New 
Hampshire).  This is because “[o]ne of the primary purposes of the removal statute—
as its history clearly demonstrates—was to have such defenses litigated in federal 
court.”  Id. (quoting Willingham v. Morgan, 395 U.S. 402, 406 (1969)).  At the same 

time, 3M “bears the burden under § 1442(a)(1).”  Moore, 25 F.4th at 34.   
In its Non-AFFF complaint against 3M, the State has made it plain that it is 
“not seeking to recover through this Complaint any relief for contamination or injury 
related to Aqueous Film Forming Foam, a firefighting material that contains PFAS.”  
Non-AFFF Compl. ¶ 15.  In addition to this allegation in the Non-AFFF Complaint, 
the State has represented in its filings that “[i]f it does turn out that contamination 

in any particular site or location is related to AFFF, then the State has disclaimed 
seeking a recovery in this action for that site or location.”  State’s Remand Mot. at 9 
(emphasis in original).                                                   
Despite  the  State’s  disclaimer  and  the  State’s  second  AFFF  lawsuit,  3M 
maintains that this Court should retain this case under its federal officer jurisdiction.  
3M’s Remand Opp’n at 1-17.  3M first observes that PFAS can “move through the 
environment—both  from  natural  processes  like  transport  in  groundwater  and 

because people collect, move, and spread PFAS-containing waste—so PFAS from 
AFFF and non-AFFF sources plausibly have commingled at various locations.”  Id. at 
6 (emphasis in original).  If so, 3M says that it “has the right to defend itself by raising 
the issue of whether alleged ‘non-AFFF’ PFAS contamination may actually derive 
from MilSpec AFFF, and by asserting its federal government contractor defense as to 
any claimed damaged from MilSpec AFFF.”  Id.  Next, 3M argues that it properly 
removed the case based on “federal enclave jurisdiction” because “PFAS from AFFF 
and non-AFFF products plausibly were released from military bases in Maine that 
are federal enclaves.”  Id.                                               

In support of its position, 3M points to four and sometimes five military 
facilities throughout the state of Maine, Brunswick Naval Air Station, Portsmouth 
Naval Shipyard, Loring Air Force Base, Bangor Air National Guard Base, and the 
Cutler Naval Air Station, that the State claims in its AFFF Complaint caused PFAS 
contamination in groundwater “throughout the State.”  Id. at 4 (quoting AFFF Compl. 
¶ 224) (emphasis in 3M Remand Opp’n); see Notice of Removal at 10.        

Although the parties fence about seepage of AFFF contamination in specific 
instances,  such  as  military  installations  and  water  districts,  the  determinative 
question rests on the interplay between the asserted federal affirmative defense and 
a motion to remand.  In Jefferson County, the Supreme Court addressed how a district 
court is to approach the assertion of an affirmative defense as the basis for federal 
jurisdiction.    527  U.S.  at  431.    The  Jefferson  County  Court  required  that  the 
affirmative defense be “colorable,” id., and noted that courts should not construe the 

federal defense requirement with a “narrow, grudging interpretation” because “one 
of the most important reasons for removal is to have the validity of the defense of 
official immunity tried in a federal court.”  Id. (quoting Willingham, 395 U.S. at 407).  
Thus, as the Supreme Court observed in Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust, 547 U.S. 
633 (2006), “[t]he federal officer removal statue allows ‘suits against federal officer 
[to] be removed despite the nonfederal cast of the complaint,’ id. at 645 n.9, (quoting 
Jefferson Cnty., 527 U.S. at 431), and reflects a congressional policy that ‘federal 
officers, and indeed the Federal Government itself, require the protection of a federal 
forum.’”  Id. (quoting Willingham, 395 U.S. at 407).                      

Although the First Circuit has not used this term, courts sometimes describe 
the burden on the removing party as making a “plausible” claim of federal officer 
defense.  See Graves v. 3MCo., 17 F.4th 764, 771 (8th Cir. 2021) (“For a defense to be 
considered colorable, it need only be plausible”) (citation omitted); Bennett v. MIS 
Corp., 607 F.3d 1076, 1089 (6th Cir. 2010); Magnin v. Teledyne Cont’l Motors, 91 F.3d 
1424, 1427 (11th Cir. 1996).                                              

Applying these principles to AFFF and Non-AFFF litigation, the district courts 
in New Hampshire and Nessel reached different conclusions.  As here, in Nessel, the 
state of Michigan attempted to strictly divide two lawsuits—one AFFF and the other 
Non-AFFF—but the district court rejected the distinction, noting that “Plaintiffs 
cannot decide what defense Defendants might present.”  Nessel, 2021 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 39175, at *10.  The Nessel Court wrote that “while Plaintiffs attempt to 
surgically divide their complaints between Commercial and MilSpec AFFF, they 

cannot prevent Defendants from raising the production of MilSPec AFFF as a defense 
or  an  alternative  theory,  particularly  when  Plaintiffs  admit  that  Defendants 
produced MilSpec AFF and that PFAS from AFFF spread contamination throughout 
the state.”  Id.  The district court concluded that “Plaintiffs’ artful pleading does not 
obviate the facts on the ground.”  Id. at *10-11.                         
Against Nessel is New Hampshire.  In New Hampshire, the district court 
focused  on  the  “specific  limitations  on  the  scope  of  [the]  plaintiff’s  claims”  and 
concluded that these limitations “eliminate a potential relationship between the 

plaintiff’s claims and a defendant’s federal acts.”  2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53461, at 
*22.  The district judge noted two other cases, where district courts honored similar 
disclaimers.  Id. at *22-24 (citing Hayden v. 3M, No. 15-2275, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
104534, at *3-4 (E.D. La. Aug. 10, 2015); Batchelor v. Am. Optical Corp., 185 F. Supp. 
3d 1358, 1363-64 (S.D. Fla. 2016) (stating that federal courts have “consistently” 
granted motions to remand in cases where the plaintiff expressly disclaims recovery 

for  claims  on  which  federal  removal  is  based)).    The  New  Hampshire  Court 
distinguished Nessel on the ground that Nessel involved “two different kinds of 
AFFF”,  whereas  New  Hampshire  addressed,  as  here,  AFFF  and  Non-AFFF 
contamination.  Id. at *26-27 (“Here, unlike Nessel, whether an alternative source of 
contamination was MilSpec AFFF is irrelevant because this suit does not involve 
AFFF, regardless of whether it is MilSpec of another version of AFFF”).   
Finally, the district judge in New Hampshire did not find “the reasoning of 

Nessel persuasive.”  Id.  The judge explained:                            
If the sources of contamination cannot be distinguished, 3M cannot be 
held liable.  That is, the State will fail to establish its own case, which 
is premised on the existence of contamination from some non-AFFF     
source.  And, if a factfinder can distinguish the sources of contamination, 
3M will prevail to the extent the factfinder determines contamination 
came from AFFF.  This is true regardless of whether 3M supplied the  
AFFF  under  federal  authority  or  warned  the  government  about  its 
dangers.                                                             

Id. (emphasis in original).                                               
On balance, the Court concludes that New Hampshire is more persuasive.  In 
Batchelor, the district court observed that “Federal courts addressing disclaimer 
provisions in similar actions have ‘recognize[d] a distinction between artful pleading 
for purposes of circumventing federal officer jurisdiction, and express disclaimers of 
the claims that serve as the ground for removal under Section 1442(a)(1).’”  Batchelor, 
185 F. Supp. 3d at 1363 (quoting Siders v. 20th Century Glove Corp. of Texas, No. 

2:15-cv-13278, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57210, at *25 (S.D.W.V. Apr. 29, 2016) (quoting 
Dougherty v. A O Smith Corp., Civil Action No. 13-1972-SLR-SRF, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 96290, at *36 (D. Del. July 16, 2014)); Kelleher v. A.W. Chesterton Co., No. 15-
cv-893, SMY-SCW, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159783, at *13 (S.D. Ill. Nov. 23, 2015); 
Madden v. A.H. Voss Co., No. C 09-03786 JSW, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24792, at *2-
3 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2009).  Here, the State’s disclaimer is express, unambiguous, 

and plain, and in the Court’s view, fits within the category of express disclaimers 
courts have found effective to justify a remand order.  Dougherty, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 96290, at *36 (Where express disclaimers are made, “federal courts have 
consistently granted motions to remand where the plaintiff expressly disclaimed the 
claims upon which federal officer removal was based”).                    
Furthermore, as Chief Judge McCafferty pointed out, by its disclaimer, the 
State has taken upon itself the burden as part of its case to demonstrate that the 

source of contamination in its Non-AFFF lawsuit is not a AFFF source.  If the 
factfinder concludes that the State has failed to meet its burden concerning the 
source, 3M will prevail.  This effectively means that the federal officer defense will 
not be applicable in the State’s Non-AFFF lawsuit because the State by its express 
disclaimer has imposed upon itself a burden to demonstrate that its claim involves 
Non-AFFF sources.  Kelleher, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 159783, at *11 (“Here, however, 

Plaintiff’s waiver has rendered any federal defenses moot”).              
In sum, because of the State’s express disclaimer, the Court concludes that this 
case must be remanded to the state of Maine Superior Court since the federal officer 
defense is not applicable.                                                
Finally, the Court concludes that federal enclave jurisdiction does not plausibly 
exist because “the doctrine of federal enclave jurisdiction generally requires that all 

pertinent events take place on a federal enclave.”  Rhode Island II, 35 F.4th at 58 
(emphasis in original).  3M suggests that the Court could assume jurisdiction under 
federal enclave jurisdiction over one site and then “exercise supplemental jurisdiction 
. . . arising from other sites.”  3M’s Remand Opp’n at 17.  But even if Brunswick Naval 
Air  Station  and  Portsmouth  Naval  Shipyard  could  fit  within  federal  enclave 
jurisdiction, the State has disclaimed any AFFF claims, including those arising from 
a federal enclave, so the argument circles back to the State’s disclaimer.   

In sum, because of the State’s express disclaimer, the Court concludes that this 
case must be remanded to the state of Maine Superior Court since the federal officer 
defense is not applicable.                                                
B.   Motion to Stay                                                  

Despite this conclusion, the Court addresses why it resolved this issue before 
the JPML acted on the motion for transfer and not stay resolution to give the JPML 
an opportunity to decide for itself whether to accept this case as part of the MDL.  
Federal courts “possess the inherent power to stay [a case] for prudential reasons.”  
Microfinancial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays Int’l, Inc., 385 F.3d 72, 77 (1st Cir. 2004).  In 

evaluating whether to issue a stay, a court will generally consider three factors: “(1) 
potential prejudice to the non-moving party, (2) hardship and inequity to the moving 
party without a stay, and (3) judicial economy.”  Good, 624 F. Supp. 2d at 134.  “The 
party seeking the stay bears the burden of demonstrating that a stay is appropriate.”  
Maine v. Wheeler, No. 1:14-cv-00264-JDL, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12334, at *8-9 (D. 
Me. Jan. 6, 2020).  Whether to stay a proceeding in anticipation of a transfer ruling 

from the JPML rests within a court’s discretion.  City of Portland v. Pardue Pharma, 
LP, No. 2:18-cv-282-NT, 1:18-cv-298-NT, 2:18-cv-310-NT; 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
201070, at *16 (D. Me. Nov.18, 2018); Good, 624 F. Supp. 2d at 134.       
Here, applying Eastern Maine, the Court’s “preliminary assessment suggests 
that removal was improper,” and therefore, “the court should promptly . . . remand 
the case to state court.” E. Maine, 581 F. Supp. 3d at 285 (quoting Meyers, 143 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1049).  “Generally, motions to remand should be resolved before the panel 

acts on the motion to transfer so the federal court can assure itself of jurisdiction 
before the case transfers to the MDL.”  Nessel, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39175, at *6.   
In addition, although the JPML analysis of whether to accept a case for MDL 
transfer is similar to this Court’s jurisdictional inquiry, they are not the same.  The 
JPML’s MDL Transfer Order filed on December 7, 2018, stated that “[a]l of the 
actions on Schedule A involve allegations that aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs, 
which are used to extinguish liquid fuel fires) contaminated the groundwater near 
certain airports and other industrial locations with perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) 
and/or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which allegedly were contained in the AFFFs 

and are toxic.”  In re Aqueous Film-Forming Foams Products Liability Litig., No. 2:18-
mn-02873-RMG, Transfer Order at 1 (ECF No. 1).  The JPML concluded that “the 
AFFF  actions listed  on  Schedule  A  involve  common  questions  of  fact,  and  that 
centralization will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote 
the just and efficient conduct of this litigation.”  Id. at 3.            
When considering whether to grant a motion to transfer a case to an MDL, the 

standard is found in 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the statute authorizing multi-district litigation.  
Section 1407 provides that the JPML shall transfer a case to an MDL “upon its 
determination that transfers for such proceedings will be for the convenience of 
parties and witnesses and will promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.”  
Id., see e.g., In re Sonic Corp. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 276 F. Supp. 3d 1382, 
1383 (JPML Dec. 6. 2017) (“On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session 
held, we find that centralization under Section 1407 in the Norther District of Ohio 

will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and 
efficient conduct of this litigation”).                                   
As described here, the jurisdictional issue before this Court does not address 
the § 1407 standards, but whether the Court should assume jurisdiction over the case 
in the first place.  Thus, even if the Court were to stay this matter to allow the JPML 
to determine whether it is an appropriate MDL case, the jurisdiction question in this 
case would not be answered by the JPML.                                   
“The district courts of the United States . . . are ‘courts of limited jurisdiction.  

They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.”  Exxon Mobil 
Corp.  v.  Allapattah  Servs.  Inc.,  545  U.S.  546,  552  (2005)  (quoting  Kokkonen  v. 
Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994)).  “The federal courts are 
under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction . . ..”  FW/PBS, 
Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  In reaching and resolving the jurisdictional 
question, this Court is acting in accordance with its independent obligation to assure 

that its jurisdiction over this lawsuit is proper.                        
Finally, as a practical matter, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit will 
resolve 3M’s appeal in New Hampshire and its resolution may well inform the proper 
disposition of this case, thus any potential prejudice to 3M is mitigated by the fact 
that it is currently before the First Circuit on a virtually identical issue and ruling.   
V.   CONCLUSION                                                           
The Court GRANTS the Plaintiff State of Maine’s Motion to Remand (ECF No. 

10) and DENIES Defendant 3M Company’s Motion to Stay (ECF No. 31).  The Court 
REMANDS this case to the State of Maine Superior Court for Cumberland County. 
SO ORDERED.
