outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Mary E. Buscone''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Buscone argued that her judicial-estoppel argument is not precluded by the bankruptcy court''s default judgment against her in the Chapter 7 proceeding, asserting that the defense has never been litigated on the merits.

  2. Buscone contended that any post-judgment interest on the state-court judgment debt should accrue at the federal rate for civil money judgments under 28 U.S.C. § 1961, and only as of the issuance of the bankruptcy court''s default judgment in the Chapter 7 proceeding, rather than at the Massachusetts state rate from the date of the state-court judgment.'
