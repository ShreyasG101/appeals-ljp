  3. Appellant argued that the district court improperly excluded a declaration by its expert, Dr. Jianqing Fan, which was filed in opposition to Defendants'' motion for summary judgment.

  4. Appellant contended that the district court improperly applied the summary judgment standard and incorrectly placed the burden on the non-moving party when finding that Appellant failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the independent origin of Defendants’ sequences.

  5. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Defendants on the misappropriation of trade secrets claim, asserting that there was sufficient evidence of use, similarity, or derivation from its trade secret (the ACE Numbers).

  6. Appellant contended that the district court erred in awarding only nominal damages on the breach of contract claim on which it prevailed, and argued that the issue of damages should have been left to a jury.
