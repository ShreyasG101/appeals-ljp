  1. Appellants argued that the district court erred in dismissing their Title VI claim, contending that MIT was deliberately indifferent to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive antisemitic harassment by failing to take sufficient action to curtail anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian protests that allegedly targeted Jewish and Israeli students.

  2. Appellants contended that the district court erred in finding that the alleged conduct did not rise to the level of actionable harassment under Title VI, asserting that the protests and related conduct constituted antisemitic harassment and deprived Jewish and Israeli students of educational opportunities and benefits.

  3. Appellants argued that the district court erred in dismissing their claim under the Ku Klux Klan Act (42 U.S.C. § 1986), asserting that MIT knowingly failed to prevent a conspiracy by student protestors to deprive Jewish and Israeli students of their civil rights, including rights under the Thirteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1982.

  4. Appellants claimed that the district court erred in dismissing their state law claims for breach of contract and negligence, arguing that MIT failed to uphold its policies and negligently failed to protect students from antisemitic harassment.

  5. Appellants asserted that the district court abused its discretion by denying them leave to further amend their complaint after dismissal, contending that the court failed to provide an adequate basis for denying leave to amend.'
