outcome: MIXED
reason_for_appeal: '=== Letitia James, in her official capacity as Attorney General of New York''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in granting a preliminary injunction against enforcement of New York General Business Law § 394-ccc (the Hateful Conduct Law) on the grounds that the statute does not compel speech in violation of the First Amendment.

  2. Appellant contended that the Policy Disclosure Requirement of the Hateful Conduct Law is a permissible commercial disclosure subject to Zauderer scrutiny, as it merely requires social media networks to disclose their content moderation policies without mandating adoption or reference to the State’s definition of ''hateful conduct.''

  3. Appellant argued that the Report Mechanism Requirement is a regulation of conduct, not speech, and does not require social media networks to reference or address the State’s definition of ''hateful conduct'' in their reporting mechanisms.

  4. Appellant asserted that, even if the requirements are subject to intermediate scrutiny, the Hateful Conduct Law survives because it is reasonably related to appropriate state interests and is not unduly burdensome.

  5. Appellant maintained that the district court erred in finding the statute facially overbroad or vague, as the law does not require social media networks to incorporate the State’s definition of ''hateful conduct'' and does not chill protected speech.'
