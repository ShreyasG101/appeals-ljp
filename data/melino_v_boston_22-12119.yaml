outcome: AFFIRM
reason_for_appeal: '=== Alexandra E. Melino''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Melino argued that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to BMC because there were disputes of material fact regarding the absolute risk reduction of the COVID-19 vaccines, the duration of protection against infection, and the duration of protection against transmission provided by the vaccines.

  2. Melino contended that BMC failed to prove that the COVID-19 vaccines actually function as vaccines so as to prevent recipients from catching and spreading COVID-19, and therefore did not establish undue hardship.

  3. Melino argued that the district court erred in denying her motion to strike portions of an affidavit submitted by BMC, asserting that references to the CDC''s recommendations constituted inadmissible hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).

  4. Melino claimed that the district court should have considered whether BMC could have provided alternative accommodations beyond a complete exemption from the vaccination requirement.'
