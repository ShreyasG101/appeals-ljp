outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== Jessica Silveira da Silva''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Silveira argued that the district court misapplied the legal standard for the ''now settled'' defense by engaging in a comparative analysis between A.R.''s life in the United States and his life in Brazil, rather than focusing solely on whether A.R. was settled in the United States.

  2. Silveira contended that the district court clearly erred in its weighing of the evidence and its ultimate conclusion that A.R. was not ''now settled'' in the United States, asserting that the evidence compelled a finding in her favor on this defense.'
