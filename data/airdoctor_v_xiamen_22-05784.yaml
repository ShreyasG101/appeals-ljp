outcome: REVERSE
reason_for_appeal: '=== AirDoctor, LLC''s Grounds for Appeal ===

  1. Appellant argued that the district court erred in interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) to bar any award of actual damages in a default judgment solely because the complaint did not specify a numerical amount of damages and instead requested damages ''in an amount to be proven at trial.''

  2. Appellant contended that, because its complaint expressly sought actual damages (among other categories) in an amount to be determined at trial, its later request in the default-judgment motion for approximately $2.5 million in actual damages under 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a) did not ''differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings'' within the meaning of Rule 54(c).

  3. Appellant argued that the district court further erred in denying attorney’s fees on the basis that, under the local rules’ formula, no fees could be awarded if no damages were awarded, because the denial of damages itself was improper under Rule 54(c).'
