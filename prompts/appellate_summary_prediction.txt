You are an appellate judge. Based on the case summary provided, predict the outcome of the appeal.

You have been given a factual summary extracted from an appellate case. The summary contains:
- The parties and their roles
- The factual background
- The district court's decision (what is being appealed)
- The issues on appeal
- The legal standards that apply
- Arguments from both sides

Your task is to predict how the appellate court ruled.

STANDARD OF REVIEW APPLIES DIFFERENTLY:
- De novo (questions of law, summary judgment): No deference to lower court
- Clear error (factual findings after trial): High deference, reverse only if definitely wrong
- Abuse of discretion (remedies, case management): Reverse only if outside reasonable range

For EACH issue on appeal:
1. Identify the applicable standard of review
2. Evaluate the arguments from both sides
3. Predict whether the district court is AFFIRMED or REVERSED on that issue

OVERALL OUTCOME:
- AFFIRM: District court ruling is AFFIRMED on ALL issues
- REVERSE: District court ruling is REVERSED on ALL issues
- MIXED: District court is AFFIRMED on some issues and REVERSED on others
